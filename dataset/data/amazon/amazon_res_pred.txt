I put this in the fridge immediately after receiving it . It took less than a minute to adjust and has been working effectively ever since . It would be nice if it came with a magnet or some adhesive to attach it to the wall of the fridge , as my fridge has nothing to hang it on , but this is overall a good product that I 'll would recommend .#### #### ####[([66], [65], 'POS')]
This is a handy little tool . I like zucchini noodles but did n't want to spend a lot on a mandolin or other type of product . This was such a low price and pretty cute I figured I would give it a try . It still takes a bit of time to shred the zucchini but for the price it 's still worth it .#### #### ####[([33], [32], 'NEU'), ([33], [36], 'NEU'), ([33], [64], 'NEU'), ([9, 10], [8], 'NEU')]

It does a great job of keeping drinks cold . I was looking for a water bottle that would not produce condensation ( sweat ) in the warm weather , and this one falls a bit short .

This fits perfectly into my 10 in cast iron pan ! ! Keeps the bacon nice and crisp .

I like the giant digits and loud alarm on this timer .

This does not make snow -- it makes big chunks of ice that are similar to what the fridge ice crusher throws out . It is also hard to crank . One person has to hold the base & cup in place while another person cranks out big chunks of ice . Not a good product .#### #### ####[([50], [47], 'NEG'), ([11], [8], 'NEG')]

They are pretty little jars . They look good in the cabinet . However , many of them do n't seal well . Also , the closing hooks come right off and sometimes do n't go back on well .

Agree with the other 5-star reviews . The heavier gauge steel makes the difference . I use this pan on the grill - it will easily tolerate direct fire or hot charcoal .

The salad shaker is attractive . I have found several ugly salad dressing shakers . The bottle opens in the middle to add ingredients for salad dressing . The top moves forward to close and store dressing in refrigerator . Then the top moves back to pour dressing on your salad . The salad dressing does not gush out . It avoids pouring too much dressing on your salad . Janice Sparks#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4], 'POS')]

I tried this after baking some molten Choco lava cookies , and this scoop to portion the cookies out . This dishes scoop is e as y to use and it does feel durable . This will last a long time .

First pourover kettle , so I cannot compare with more expensive options , but this gives a lot of control . More robust than it looks , it has hit the floor and the neck did not get bent .

Makes the coffee taste better than you can get with a paper filter . This thin micro-perforated design is much smarter than the mesh ones with a containing collar .

these are fine , colored plastic acrylic cups that we purchased for our two boys , 6 and 4 . Be aware of the size - 8 oz is n't that big , the cups seem much smaller in person than on the site .

Like the weight and size , however do n't like that it gets rusty easily . Needs to be seasoned often to prevent rusting . Otherwise works good . And one needs to be careful with the handles since it does get hot too when placed on the heat source .#### #### ####[([37], [42], 'NEU')]

I oiled it up 6 separate times before I used it yet the wood was too abrasive to scoop out avocado .

More than half of them have fallen apart in the first week of use . They are very thin plastic and the lids crack easily with typical use .

Do n't even believe the dimensions ..... useles for what I had in mind for it . Why is it so hard to measure width x length. < br /> Looks solid , but useless for my intentions .... length is very short. < br /> Totally disappointed#### #### ####[([5], [21], 'NEG')]

Fits my cutting boards behind my kitchen sink . My sink is on a corner , so it fills the space well . Good use of storage for a small space there .#### #### ####[([26], [23], 'POS'), ([30], [29], 'POS')]

One signal is n't enough to let you know it is finished . two , three , four signals are n't enough . 5 annoying signals every single time it completes a cycle !#### #### ####[([25], [24], 'NEG'), ([1], [2, 3], 'NEG')]
Very cute ! Lots of pieces ... smaller in size . Worked great for my kindergarteners . I took the advice of another person who purchased and used hot glue instead of the stickers provided . None broke !#### #### ####[([29], [1], 'POS')]
Buyer beware . This for one foot . That is what the ad says and that 's what you get . There are much better deals on sets of 5 which is what most Kitchenaids require .#### #### ####[([25], [24], 'NEG')]
Decent set of salt & pepper shakers . My only complaint is for those of you like me that use a fine salt ( Diamond Crystal ) the holes are a little big , so you have to be careful when sprinkling the salt on your food because you might find more than you wanted .#### #### ####[([3], [0], 'POS'), ([22], [32], 'POS'), ([28], [32], 'POS')]
Excellent price and service#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS')]

I originally bought this to use when scooping up our cucumber salad ( which we have a lot of since our garden is producing many cucumbers !) and it works great for that . It also works as a great spoon / spatula when using nonstick cookware. < br />< br /> Even my husband said just the other day that he loves this silicone skimmer .#### #### ####[([65], [39], 'POS'), ([65], [62], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [29, 30], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [30], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [62], 'POS')]

I have really enjoyed using my thermos . It actually keeps a can drink cold much longer than it does without it . I think this was a great purchase for the price .#### #### ####[([29], [28], 'POS'), ([32], [28], 'POS'), ([6], [3], 'POS')]

i brought two of these which are surprisingly high quality . I use one for steeping tea and ginger while I use the other in an art cup to collect colored pencil shavings for art. < br />< br /> In both applications , this beauty exceeded my expectations . Love them ! !#### #### ####[([9], [8], 'POS'), ([16], [8, 9], 'POS')]

This is a good quality pan . Cleans up well and balanced to lay flat on the burner .#### #### ####[([5], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([5], [11], 'POS')]
It was a great grinder . We had matching salt and pepper and I loved the easy to fill and gorgeous design . After several years it died ( pepper only ) and no longer engages the grinder . I could replace it , but there is no way to get customer service from the manufacturer and I am choosing to go with a different brand . Sad . It was great while it lasted#### #### ####[([65], [20], 'POS'), ([4], [71], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([21], [71], 'POS'), ([21], [14], 'POS'), ([21], [20], 'POS')]
