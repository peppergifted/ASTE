As a family allergic to wheat , dairy , eggs , nuts , and several other things , we love the entire Cravings Place line of products as it allows us to bake treats with minimal effort and ingredients . Most allergy-free and gluten-free mixes usually just omit one or two allergens at most , so it 's great to see a mix created without many of the most common allergens . ( Note these still have soy and corn ) . We consume these on a regular basis and have been doing so for years .#### #### ####[([33], [41], 'POS')]

Used to be a decent product . Disgusting now and difficult on digestion . All 3 purchased from Costco over past couple months end in same result -- open the container and it smells like rancid oil .

I cannot tell the difference in taste between soy sauce and these Bragg Liquid Aminos . I 'm glad I bought the small spray bottle of it so that I can have better control of how much I use as it is powerful stuff ! Since I 'm watching my sodium intake I like to make my own stir-fry dishes and can still enjoy that &# 34 ; soy sauce &# 34 ; flavor enhancer without overdoing it . It 's pretty good also on a home cooked burger and beef steak - slather melted butter on top of the cooked meat before serving , give it a quick spray of aminos , a few grinds of black pepper ....... and enjoy !#### #### ####[([111], [108], 'POS'), ([43], [42], 'POS')]

I bought this from a local super market on a whim and decided to let people know how it tastes . I 'm a huge fan of peanut butter and salted caramel. < br />< br /> For instance , I had a Salted Caramel and Almond Kind Bar today and it was amazing . It tasted like you would expect it to taste. < br />< br /> However , this particular product tastes like a chemical spill . It starts off with a peanut butter taste , but then the ( caramel I 'm guessing ) tastes kind of burnt and chemical-like , and then it finishes with a very salty burnt taste. < br />< br /> I had some on a spoon and disliked it , then I put some on pretzel bread and it was slightly palatable , but overall I would avoid this product as it does n't really taste like salted caramel peanut butter. < br />< br /> Just for fun , I let my co-workers taste it and only 1 out of 5 of them thought that this product tasted &# 34 ; okay &# 34 ; . The rest of them shared my sentiment .#### #### ####[([149], [141], 'NEG'), ([15], [24], 'NEG'), ([31], [24], 'NEG'), ([15], [5], 'NEG')]

LifeSavers brand has been around for a long , long time . I can remember that when I was just a kid my Grandfather always carried either a roll of the Wint-O-Green or Peppermint LifeSavers in one of his business suit fob pockets . If he knew I would be visiting him and Gram at the farm , he 'd hide a roll of the fruit flavored LifeSavers in one of the small chest pockets of his bib overalls for me to find . What a treat ! To this day , when I eat any one of these mints , fond memories of my Grandfather and good times at the farm come flooding back . The mints have a long lasting flavor that leaves my mouth feeling fresh and cool . I buy these large bags at Walmart all the time for six dollars ninety eight a bag so not too sure why they are so pricey here .#### #### ####[([1], [9], 'POS'), ([148], [157], 'POS')]

My kids and I are completely obsessed with cotton candy , however the majority of the cotton candy on the market is NOT organic , so when I discovered this organic cotton candy from Spun Paradise Cotton Candy Co. , I knew that we had to give it a try ... imagine , delicious flavored cotton candy , but organic ! Hooray !< br />< br /> My cotton candy package arrived quickly to my home and was in perfect condition in the very nice plastic containers . I am always iffy about ordering food through the mail , however , this cotton candy was perfect , not melted or damaged in any way . We ordered 4 different flavors , and had to immediately try each and every one . The watermelon quite tasty and did n't taste artificial at all , but yummy and very true to flavor . I also found that this cotton candy does n't just melt away like typical cheapie cotton candy tends to . It melts nicely in the mouth and is absolutely delicious . I will never ever ever go back to the average run of the mill cotton candy and will definitely be repurchasing from Spun Paradise in the future !!< br />< br /> I received this product at no cost to me and have provided my honest and unbiased review in return .#### #### ####[([68], [59], 'POS'), ([132], [139], 'POS'), ([69], [79], 'POS'), ([75], [79], 'POS'), ([94], [84], 'POS')]

Who knew you could enjoy an energy drink for breakfast ? I received this product to try and review from bzzagent.com . I love the taste of this V8 V-Fusion + Energy . You can taste both the peach and the mango and the combination is delicious . It is not as sweet as fruit juice . The drink contains 50 % juice , and and also green tea . There is no added sugar which is a selling point for me as my fiance has diabetes and I try to watch my sugar intake as well . There is a mild amount of caffeine in the drink which I prefer as too much caffeine makes me jittery . V8 V-Fusion + Energy has just enough to get you through a busy morning .

I needed more fiber in my diet and decided to try these Fiber One Oats and Chocolate Bars . They satisify my need for fiber and my love of chocolate. < br />< br /> Each bar is 1.4 ounces and provides 35 % of your daily fiber . They have 4g of fat per bar . These bars are made by General Mills . The bars are chewy and a little crunchy . They are naturally flavored . Some of the ingredients in the bar are semisweet chocolate chips , whole grain oats , barley flakes , sugarcane fiber , soy lecithin and milk. < br />< br /> This is a great value for this hard cardboard box . This is the price that I would get if I went to Sam 's Club . These bars are regularly sold in vending machines and at convenience stores . They are great snacks , for the kids in-between meals , to take on the run , to take on vacations or anytime you want something healthy to eat on the go. < br />< br /> I was very pleased with these bars and I continue to purchase them .#### #### ####[([181], [176], 'POS'), ([55], [46], 'POS'), ([193], [190], 'POS'), ([43], [46], 'POS')]
Like most working moms , I ca n't pump enough to feed my baby exclusively breast milk . For these formulas , I preferred the gentle version to the soothe version for our son . Overall , these are n't my favorite formulas . I felt like they caused more intestinal issues than other formulas . ( I 'm still stymied why many formulas , like the soothe version , use complex sugars when babies should be getting most of their sugars in a simple form , like they do in breast milk . I know it 's probably cheaper for the company , but I 'd prefer to pay more and have a formulation closer to breast milk . But this is just my opinion , and this may work very well for lots of people . )#### #### ####[([81], [78], 'NEU'), ([67], [71], 'NEU'), ([92], [99], 'NEU'), ([81], [84], 'NEU'), ([3], [1], 'NEU')]

I personally have 5 days sets and have also bought 2 sets for other people in my home . The two other sets I have decided to keep for myself . the purpose of keeping them for myself is to use them for other other than salt and pepper . they stay perfect , I use them constantly ! I have a couple of people here that use them , say that there 's just awesome . I did have a salt shaker that had a little problem converting from sea salt to Himalaya salt . did not fall out correctly so what I did was I just took a top of part which is really simple it 's like five pieces total and just kind of cleaned around the Teflon and you know that the salt buildup from there was caused by humidity , cleaned out , my gosh it 's unbelievable how much better , its almost better than new Thank You Bavaria these are top of the line in my book I hope in the near future you have some more come out . I sure would like to buy some more and some for my kids and family for Christmas otherwise I 'm keeping what I have .

The description says &# 34 ; Suitable for all type of surfaces &# 34 ; but it is not true !< br />< br /> We ordered this item for our large family ( we like to cook a lot ) but this does not work as advertised !< br />< br /> This pressure cooker does NOT work for induction stoves .

Magefesa said that the 14.3 quart pot will work on induction stoves and the description here on Amazon clearly states that it will work on induction stoves. < br />< br /> Thankfully Amazon has a great return process so they will send a truck to pick this up and they will send the other version in a couple days .#### #### ####[([28], [19], 'NEG')]

I had never tried coffee with this method . A friend of mine had a really high end model and I remember her coffee being so delicious and full of flavor . When I got this , I was n't sure of what grounds to use . I finally found some coarse grind and since then , have a coffee grinder that does a coarse grind . I have tried this with just regular coffee as well and it was n't quite the same , not the same flavor , not as strong , but it was a standard brand . The box says to steep for 3 to 4 minutes , I found 5 to be the best . I heated my water to boiling , then let it sit off the burner for about a minute , then poured a little in , stirred gently , then poured the rest of the water in .

In general , I love this pitcher because the shape is sleek and it does not take up too much space on the refrigerator shelf . I have a couple of comments on weakness , but I do love it and will continue to use it daily. < br />< br /> Included is a tube for freezing ice but the only cap provided is the top of the pitcher onto which it screws . Had a a separate screw top been provided , this could be frozen while the pitcher is still being used . Secondly , the lid must be carefully positioned and gently pushed onto the pitcher . Now onto the reasons I love it. < br />< br /> As I said earlier , the shape is lovely but the pitcher is also well balanced for carrying and pouring . The infuser is excellent for brewing sun tea . I make a large tea bag filled with the selection of the day and screw it into the lid to keep it from flowing into the infuser . This makes it easy to remove quickly and restricts any of the leaves or herbs from flowing into the tea. < br />< br /> I 've rigged up a cap for the ice tube and freeze it upright in my freezer ice holder . This enables me to use the pitcher without pause . A sample was provided for honest evaluation .#### #### ####[([242], [241], 'POS')]

Pros : This juicer is powerful .

The Brita Hard Sided Water Filter Bottle is a decent water bottle . It is great in the amount of water it can hold and its filtering capabilities , however , I found htis product to be extremely fragile . I work in a fast paced setting which may , at times , require me to fumble with multiple objects with my hands . This has resulted with me dropping my bottle . The body of the bottle remained in tact , however , the lid of the bottle cracked and became unusable . I found http :// www.amazon.com / Brita-Sport-Filter-Bottle-20-Ounce / dp / B004GN8RDY / ref = pd _ sim _ 79 _ 5 ? ie = UTF8 & refRID = 1J5VV6TC1C07ZPW2SAWN & dpSrc = sims & dpST =_ AC _ UL160 _ SR160 % 2C160 _ to align more with my needs than the hard sided water filter bottle. < br />< br /> I forgot to mention , the bottle does leak as well . There has been multiple occasions where I put the water bottle in my duffle bag before heading off to the gym / work , and found my clothes and other materials to be drenched . All in all , I found this water bottle to be mediocre at best . I could only really recommend it to someone who works at a place that does not require you to move about much as well as for people who do not mind holding the bottle upright when transporting it from one place to another to prevent leakage .#### #### ####[([34], [38], 'NEU'), ([11], [15], 'NEU'), ([51], [58], 'NEU'), ([162], [171], 'NEU')]

Good filter . Collapses and expands as expected . Has nice side tabs to easily pick the filter up to see how full your mug is . I have n't had any problems with the filter collapsing mid-use .

What I like about the dishes : The color is a clear red / cranberry color , the swirly design can go with almost any casual d & eacute ; cor , and they were made from recycled glass . They are pretty , but not beautiful. < br /> What I do n't like : they are on the thicker side and have different flaws such as inclusions of foreign materials ( small pebbly structures in random places including obvious places on the rims ) as well as the circle in the middle of each plate where it sat through its cooling process at the manufacturing plant. < br /> Overall , I am intending to use these plates for casual meals so they will do . But for the price , I wish they were better made . I want to support an enterprise that is making use of recycled glass to create a potential useful and beautiful product but it makes me feel like the enterprise is not giving enough attention to producing a quality , superior product. < br /> Thank you .#### #### ####[([173], [172], 'POS')]

Good value for the price . The screen looks like it was cut slightly too large before attachment so there is a slight overhang sticking out around the sides below which is why I 'm only giving 4 / 5 rather than 5 / 5 , however , the overall manufacturing quality seems good for the price . If you have the extra cash and you do n't mind splurging I highly recommend a spacecase ( I had one before I moved , however , I left it behind ) , but this product is a solid alternative as long as you keep an eye on the bottom &# 34 ; collection &# 34 ; piece to make sure none of that excess screen breaks off and falls in . So far I have n't had any issues with that happening though so all in all I 'm fully satisfied with the product. < br />< br /> Note the picture provided is the screen piece upside down showing the screen overhang and the threading which attaches to the collection piece .#### #### ####[([4], [0], 'POS'), ([123], [118], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS')]

[[ VIDEOID : 85e425d2c6bdcc1dff260a05cc5f7000 ]] So a few months back I had gotten wine coolers and of course since hubby dislikes wine , he was quite upset . Seeing these , I knew these would be perfect for him . First off , they come very well packaged and look of very high quality . Put it in the freezer for a few hours to get it nice and chilled . Opened a slightly chilled beer ( took a swig out if not it will overflow the beer ) and placed the chiller in , waited what seemed like forever - you know about 2 seconds -- and took another drink . Hubby noticed it came out colder than the first drink , it did n't have a different taste , and it was easy to drink through the chiller . The chiller did n't impede on the drinkability of the beer ! Highly recommend these for any beer drinker ! Save your red solo cups and save your ice !

If you can lift the filled bag ( s ) ( I pack mine heavy ! ) - you have a very smooth trip .

This is a replacement for a similar grip-type jar opener that wore out after several years of use . Thus far , we have found this version to be okay - nothing special .

This is a very nice toaster so far . I 've had it a couple of months . It is attractive , convenient to use and easy to clean . The bread toasts evenly and perfect once you find your favorite temperature . The defroster is a great asset I made toast sporadically so I freeze the bread . The toaster efficiently thaws the toast then continues to cook it brown and crispy on the outside , it is moist in the center and not soggy . The toast turned out a little soggy on the top a couple of times . The bread had been in the freezer a while . Now I check the bread and scrape off the frost and the toast turns out great . I have not used the toaster for bagels but learned by pushing the wrong button that it cooks on one side . I gave it four stars instead of five since I have had the toaster a short time and cannot vouch for longevity .#### #### ####[([31], [40], 'POS')]

It was really gross and a lot of work to clean up . I contacted Ninja today and asked for a replacement lid , since the rubber is disintegrating . They said no . So I 'll be sending my Ninja to Goodwill and researching better options .#### #### ####[([31], [30], 'NEG'), ([20], [29], 'NEG'), ([33], [29], 'NEG'), ([40], [30], 'NEG')]

[[ VIDEOID : d9f20ae7e2d5c0782fae6b7f47d7d36a ]] Our apartment kitchen is not very spacious . I 'm always looking into gadgets take will take less space on counter and are still useful for day-to-day basis . I came across these spice jars that attach to refrigerator or appliance in your kitchen , which means no counter space needed ! That got my interest . Here what i liked about these jars : 1 ) See through window . No need to open lid to check which spice it is . 2 ) 2 side holes on lid for pouring and sprinkling the spices 3 ) Jars are NOT made of plastic ( lids are though ) . 4 ) Holds good amount of spices . 5 ) I was impressed how strong the magnetic base is . I do n't have to worry about spice jars dropping accidentally from refrigerator / appliance . It took good force to pull it off from refrigerator . They are lightweight jars . It can be counted in pros and cons as well . Some may compare weight to quality . For me , the quality is very good for daily use and magnet is super strong . May be if it was any heavier , with spice added , it would have effected its magnetic hold . I have my most used spices in these jars now . They are so accessible . We had guests at our house , and they complimented me how creative the idea was , and how well the look blended with our refrigerator . I have n't been able to find if they are dishwasher safe . I will contact the seller and update the review . Its a very nice set . I 'm going to buy another set to gift my sister as well . **[...] I try very hard to test all features before giving my unbiased opinion to users .

First of all , I do n't know what three cups of European style coffee means . If it meant the size of espresso , then I would agree . I would think this is more of a regular size coffee . So do n't think you can make enough coffee to share with someone else . This is more for personal use . The press is of decent quality considering the price . The milk frothier works well though you may think it is a little bit flimsy . Overall , this is a good fresh press for your enjoyment .#### #### ####[([39], [38], 'POS')]
It does a great job of keeping drinks cold . I was looking for a water bottle that would not produce condensation ( sweat ) in the warm weather , and this one falls a bit short .

A great bottle none the less , and amazing customer service .#### #### ####[([35], [27], 'NEU'), ([72], [67], 'NEU'), ([28], [27], 'NEU')]

This fits perfectly into my 10 in cast iron pan ! ! Keeps the bacon nice and crisp .

This knife has been an incredible asset to my kitchen . Breaking down a butternut squash with this is a lot of fun . It arrived sharp enough to cut and use but you 'll want to have it sharpened . I had really good results with the Wusthof branded Chef 's Choice PETec grinder. < br />< br /> I do have one complaint and something for new buyers to watch out for . The knife is rather sharp right at the bottom of the half bolster where it meets the heel , not on the cutting edge . I managed to cut myself at this spot while washing the knife . I took a rotary tool and ground it down smooth ( see picture ) , and I 'm sure a sharpening service could probably fix this if asked . I still love the knife despite this oversight but I was surprised that this was n't ground smooth at the factory. < br />< br /> The other Ikon knives in the series did n't seem to have this problem ( a little pointy but not enough to cut yourself with ) .#### #### ####[([185], [188], 'POS'), ([134], [131], 'POS'), ([185], [184], 'POS')]

This product is great for freezing small portions of pesto and other sauces . Like most silicone products , it does hold some odors from previous uses , but wiping them out with white vinegar helps .

I have been looking for coffee equipment for travel as I just do n't want to drink hotel coffee anymore . A burr small hand grinder is the most important if you want freshly grounded coffee daily . Basically there are two designs available . One is stainless and shaped like this one and the other one is the hario mini with a hourglass shape . I got the hario mini first because I like the design and glass look better . Then I saw this product comes with a bag and I thought that is better for packing it in my luggage . After I received it here is my thought compared to the Hario mini . The grind parts ca n't completely separated like the hario mini which in my opinion is good and bad . Good thing is because it has less components , I feel it gave me a little more consistent grind . Bad thing is washing is tougher . And then while actually grinding the coffee , I feel the Hario mini actually feels better in the hand because it feels more sturdy and the shape fits better . Another issue is because the bottom of this product is snap in instead of screw in , I always feel it might come off when I am grinding . At the end , both get the job done and neither is perfect so hopeful this review can help you decide depends on what pros suit your need the most. < br />&# 34 ; I received this items at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. &# 34 ;#### #### ####[([42], [43], 'NEU'), ([132], [138], 'NEU'), ([102], [96], 'NEU')]

Pro : They look nice , they 're easy to unpack , the door is easy to reverse , and they really do hold 106 bottles , even with the largish American-style pinot noir bottles. < br /> Con : Extremely noisy . I 've set mine for 55 degrees . They mostly sit at 57 , gasping and wheezing like a pair of sick old animals . The fans seem to run on a cycle of around 7 seconds on and 10 off , and they 're not synchronized , so every few seconds there 's a significant change in the ghastly racket that they make . Does n't become unnoticeable white noise the way a more steady noise source would .#### #### ####[([13], [15], 'NEU'), ([66], [65], 'NEU'), ([113], [111], 'NEU'), ([69], [65], 'NEU'), ([103], [93], 'NEU')]

My wife and I were looking for reusable straws after we acquired iced coffee addictions and were burning through regular straws .

The kitchen grinder is an awesome tool and comes in pretty packaging - a black pouch with a scraper inside the last grinder piece . I use it to grind garlic into tiny pieces instead of the messy ' squeezy ' thing . It works wonders ! First you peel off the garlic skin and break it into its cloves . Then you stick the cloves into the grinder and give it a few spins . Out come perfectly minced pieces. < br /> One morning I did n't have time to cook my steal-cut oatmeal , so I tried sicking it in this grinder and then stuck the contents into the microwave like quick oats for two minutes . This thing works wonders . Do check it out !#### #### ####[([15], [14], 'POS'), ([74], [73], 'POS')]

These are a great size and a good value compared to other bento-style lunch kits . I have re-ordered a second set . The first set lasted two school years . Pros : I like the three decently sized sections . Perfect for a sandwich , a vegetable and a fruit . Love that it 's just one lid and one bottom to wash . We hand washed to increase their longevity . Cons : They are quite susceptible to cracking in a cold climate ( they were used in - 20'F weather ) . However , we were still able to continue using them despite the small cracks .

One of the attributes that I thought would be great was the rubber bottom , but it turned out to be more trouble than help .

I was happy when I bought this blender and saw how well it blended fresh fruits into smoothies . But it was not a cheap appliance . It is just two years old and will no longer work . The blades are freezing up when I run it with food . When I run it with water , the water turns grey because there is black rubber dust from the jar moving on the base . I 've been trying to reach Breville and have had no success . I was going to work with them on-line with questions about what parts I need to order . But in order to put through a question the screen is asking for a 3 digit code . The illustration showing where to find the number is half covered up on-line . I tried calling their phone number and even though it is still an hour till closing , the phone message says their offices are closed .#### #### ####[([7], [14], 'NEG')]

Typical quality cake pans from Wilton . Nice pans , work well . When I got them & opened them , I decided not to use them for the party I intended to use them for .

the finish on this unit is good w / a high polish . unfortunately the pot underperforms . even with both screens installed the plunger does not create a really tight seal so the sediment still comes through in your pour . my glass bodum press seals so well that the plunger can only be depressed slowly .

I use these molds to make party favors for baby showers . I put sprinkles on the bottom of the molds and then I cover them with white , melted chocolate and the result is beautiful .

Love them ! ! Made of lower grade stainless steel ( magnet will not stick to them ) . Polished rings with brushed nickel in the larger space . Holes are the perfect size for coarse ground pepper and sea salt , which is exactly what I was looking for ! Salt / pepper comes out with a shake and does n't pour out but also you do n't feel like you are getting a work out when shaking like shakers with less / smaller holes do . Easy to clean though the insides did appear a little tarnished after getting them in the mail . But visually perfect on the exterior . One has a P , other and S. So they are still easy to identify since they are not see-thru . Happy I purchased them . Only reason for only 4 stars is that I would have liked them to be a higher grade stainless .#### #### ####[([36], [32], 'POS'), ([39], [35], 'POS'), ([36], [35], 'POS')]

I have a Deloghi Super-Auto and descale regularly when the light illuminates. . Thie frequency of descale cycles is preset through the use of a water test strip Delonghi provides with their new machines . I use delivered spring water in my machine which is surprisingly low in calcium given the source . That being said , about 2 years ago I noticed a decrease in the effectiveness of descales , as determined by a reduction in the dissolved calcium present in the discharge water . It was never a significant amount , but enough for me to see small calcium particles discharged from the machine accompanied by a sulfur smell in the water . Now I see very little come out and hardly any odor at all. < br />< br /> I wondered if perhaps it had been reformulated , so I looked on the manufacturers website and noticed a old and new MSDS sheet posted , which I believed might confirm my suspicion . I contacted the company to inquire if indeed it had been reformulated due to some EPA mandate and to ask what changed . While I learned the formula does vary by country , the person claimed there had n't been a change and also asked if I might have descaled previously with citric acid . I have n't , but apparently this can inhibit the effectiveness . I continue to use the product but am concerned of its efficacy . Other reviewers have posted favorable results . The bottled water co has n't changed its source , so I ca n't account for the difference but it 's something to watch for and time will tell. < br />< br /> For those wondering if there is a difference is between this and the bulk formula in the light grey bottle ( which seems a much better value ) there actually is . This formula does n't foam up which it works , while the other one does . The air created by the foam in the descale process is said to be detrimental to our machines , thus the reason for this Special low-suds version .#### #### ####[([38], [46], 'NEU'), ([257], [251], 'NEU'), ([83], [90], 'NEU'), ([38], [32], 'NEU'), ([42], [32], 'NEU')]

Bought this for our upcoming Alaska trip , where we needed to pack sandwiches for lunch everyday and our lodges only had a small microwave and fridge. < br />< br /> This worked perfectly with various powered microwaves , and fit in even one of the tiniest microwaves I 've seen in my life . I did have to remove the glass plate in that microwave to fit this little device. < br />< br /> It took anywhere between 15-18 min for hard boiled eggs , and I left the eggs in it for an hour or so afterward , so they would be really hardboiled . I ca n't digest soft boiled eggs so this was really important to me. < br />< br /> That being said , no explosions ( so far ) , and perfect eggs every time . It helped me make nutritious sandwiches on our hikes .#### #### ####[([54], [47], 'POS')]

We like to slice sharp cheddar cheese blocks for an evening cheese and crackers snack . The wire on the cheese slicers we had been using kept breaking with the hard cheese . We do n't like the hand held cutters either because we ca n't get even slices . In my search for something better I found the Westmark Cheese Slicer With Stainless Steel Blade . I decided to give it a try and it is fantastic ! The firm cutting blade easy slices through the hard cheese with ease . My husband really likes the adjustable thickness dial . He was amazed at how thin the cheese could be sliced with it . You just put the cheese against the back and the guide on the right to get evenly cut cheese slices every time ! I am not sure why this is n't sold in our local stores because it works so well . It is the best cheese slicer out there so I was really glad to find it at Amazon .#### #### ####[([60], [55], 'POS'), ([40], [30], 'POS')]

I love to putz around the kitchen and wanted a waffle iron . I happened on this product and I was instantly taken by it - make waffles , grilled cheese sandwiches and fry eggs all on the same gizmo was too good to believe . And it had removable plates so it can be dishwasher cleaned. < br /> I immediately ordered and it worked like a charm EXCEPT that after a few uses the lock that held the two side at a 90 degree angle quit working . I sent it back and got another one ( I liked it that much ) . Unfortunately , it is at my vacation home and I only got to use it a couple of times .

This peel works with intended . I am making pizza in a wood fired oven . The oven is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit hot and the handle is long enough to avoid burns on my hands . It is a small peel but it has to be to work effectively with small pizzas . Mine are about 30 cm . Note that this is a turning peel , NOT the type of peel that will get the pizza in or out of the oven. < br /> One downside is that the peel was drenched in some sort of oil and I would have expected a cleaner product , especially for the price . I cleaned it and it is fine now . I anticipate that this peel will outlast me . I think the product is overpriced given that simplicity of it ( one metal pipe , three rivets , one piece of sheet metal ) but it does work and it is a good quality .#### #### ####[([52], [51], 'POS'), ([166], [165], 'POS'), ([41], [51], 'POS')]

I had several incomplete sets of measuring spoons and was hoping to buy a replacement set that would not break .

Unfortunately , the labels rubbed off within a month , so now I have to guess at which spoon looks like 1 / 2 tsp etc .

This grinder does exactly what I need it to do , grind my coffee beans to make espresso . Sure it takes a while , but it is n't any slower than any other manual method . Produces a consistent grind , easy to clean . Holds the perfect amount of beans for a 6cup espresso maker ( or enough for one large cup of coffee ) . Very satisfied with purchase . The adjustment does n't seem to do much , from fine to coarse it seems to produce a consistent fine / med espresso grind . Perfect for my purpose and would work fine for drip method but maybe a little too fine for percolator unless you use filter . Have used it for french press with very good results , leaving the last bit in the carafe , it can be a little muddy but I find that to be true anytime I make french press , regardless what method of grinding I use .

I received two different styles ( and , apparently , different builds ) of this product in exchange for my unbiased review . This is the first one I received , and it came with no instructions for use . Because I did not know the top part was supposed to be pulled up and off the see-through part in order to fill it , I only tried to do that once and it was so tightly fitted onto the cannister that I thought that must not be the way to do it . I wound up going in through the bottom of the grinder , removing the screw-on part that is used to adjust the grinder and having to take the ceramic burr grinder piece out to put salt in it . This was too aggravating for words , and then I could n't get it to grind well . I did like the flat-top styling of this grinder better than the rounded one that came a few days later . Fortunately , the tops are completely interchangeable. < br />< br /> The other version , [[ ASIN : B013S8F8I4 iKoo Battery Powered Brushed Stainless Steel body - Top button Automatic Salt , Pepper , or Spice Mill with Led light ( one pack )]] , was made better than the first one I received . Where before there had been a black plastic thumbscrew type mechanism that could be easily unscrewed , this new one had a different mechanism involving a stainless steel screw that seems more secure and well built . The instructions showed exactly how to insert batteries and fill the spice canister , so I knew the top was supposed to pull off and was n't so intimidated in trying it . With a slight loosening of the grinder screw on the bottom , my pink Himalayan salt ground up perfectly , which is really nice to have at the table . The grinder does not make much noise when grinding , which is a good thing . I was able to pull the flat-top head from the other grinder off and put it onto the newer one , and now I have a grinder I really like. < br />< br /> The product could be improved by including some kind of funnel to help pour the spice into the cannister . It is not completely open ; there is a cross bar over it , and my regular funnels do n't fit . I had to make a paper funnel to fill the grinder without spilling salt all over the place . I do n't know what the ultimate price of these grinders will wind up being & mdash ; I know a lot of vendors price things unreasonably high to keep people from buying them until they get a few last-minute kinds worked out & mdash ; but if the price stays in the $ 75 range , I would expect less plastic inside and also perhaps a funnel and a little stand to sit it in that could double as a measuring receptacle so the whole thing could sit beside the stove for cooking. < br />< br /> Finally , the four AA batteries make this grinder pretty heavy for what it does . While the shape of it is good , the weight is not . Is that much juice really needed to grind salt and peppercorns ? If one were trying to grind coffee beans in something like this ( do n't even think it ; the burrs are too small ) , I could see it.and my regular funnels do n't fit .

They are super cool , and worth the conversation . However , the design is lacking a bit. . that are not very user friendly . They definitely take up space in the freezer since its a horizontal based design , which would be worth it if they were easy to get into the freezer ! Once you fill them , the silicone construction is very wobbly , which makes it near impossible not to spill on your way there . I managed to get them in with a small tray underneath , but the tray was my own and was not included . That being said , once I figured out they needed extra support , and was able to provide that , myself , it was worth the hassle . The guitars popped right out , once frozen , and the guitar frets stayed nicely in place until the ice was melted . My children even talked me into making them with juice so they could use them as Popsicles , and that worked as well ! Again , need a little bit of finesse on your part , but , worth it ? I think so. .#### #### ####[([189], [183], 'POS'), ([62], [72], 'POS'), ([115], [114], 'POS'), ([189], [193], 'POS')]

I have a butcher block full of knives that have not been sharpened since I got them . There is a tent at my local farmers market that sharpens knives , but I never wanted to pay that cost so getting this little sharpener is a much needed addition to my kitchen. < br />< br /> It works extremely quickly - from dull to sharp - with just a few swipes . Before using this the only way I could cut through the skin of a tomato was to pierce it with the knife tip . Now I can cut through it like regular people . I am feeling empowered LOL !< br />< br /> The directions are very clear and easy to read and understand. < br />< br /> Please note you cannot use this sharpener with serrated edge knives nor scissors .

I have had some problems using this . First , it does n't hold still with the amount of pressure you need to apply to slice produce , even with the suction cups . For carrots and cucumbers , there is this metal piece that hold the vegetable in place that it about 1 / 3-1 / 2 the size of the produce , so while you do get some slices , 1 / 3-1 / 2 a carrot will end up one long cylinder by the end of the process . I was hoping to use zucchinis with this , but it was more trouble than it should be to make vegetable noodles for the total setup and the wasted portion .

Was n't sure if this would really work but it actually did ! I had a few glass containers that didnt have a cover anymore and this was super great solution !

GREAT MACHINE I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS')]
Thankfully , I have n't had the plastic taste problem , so I cannot address it . However , I have noticed a few things I love and a few things I do n't like about this unit . Some have been addressed in other reviews , but are worth mentioning again. < br />< br /> Brewing with a K Cup : What surprised me most about using a K Cup in this machine was how much better the coffee was than in my Keurig . I 've owned two different Keurig Units and decided when the second unit broke down ( both lasting only about 18 months ) that I was done with them . I think the tastier cup of coffee in this unit stems from a few things : ( 1 ) The adapter puts a large hole into the side of the K Cup , rather than a small puncture ; ( 2 ) The coffee is just hotter in the end ( I 'm not sure if this is because of the brew temperature ( which I always cranked up on my Keurig units to try to get a hotter cup of coffee ) , or because the water flows out differently instead of through a tiny hole giving it more chance of cooling ) . More of the flavors of the coffees I 've used are noticeable in this machine , with the subtle flavors really exploding . The flavors are all just bolder from this machine using a K-Cup . That said , it is a little messier to use a K Cup . You have to push the K cup into the unit to rip open the bottom of the cup , rather than just set it into place and it all happens when you close the lid . After that , you place the K Cup holder into the machine and push down the handle to pop the top . So there is a two step process for this , but it is n't difficult . Sadly , after brewing , the K Cup is REALLY hot . There 's hot water all over the top of the K Cup unit as well , so if you have sensitive hands , you 'll have to wait a bit for the unit to cool or use some tool to remove the K Cup after brewing . I 'm a bit nuts about wanting to pull them out right away and dispose of them , but now I just leave it for a while to cool . The water will drip out when you pull the K Cup unit out of the machine . You should also note that you wo n't have the fast cup of joe you may be used to with the Keurig . This machine takes a while before it actually starts brewing , not only to heat the water , but it just seems slower in the brew process as well . I 'll sacrifice that speed for the better cup of coffee any day . As some mentioned , the burner gets hot on the carafe side , even when only brewing on the cup side . The water reservoir is really annoying . You have to put the amount of water you want in the reservoir for each brew . There are markers on the reservoir for a K cup brew , a single cup brew and the carafe brew . There is only one reservoir , not two separate ones for this , so the machine brews however much water you have in the unit . There is n't a cut off switch . Be cautious not to overflow your cup . Like most have mentioned , I 've been filling the reservoir with the cup I intend to use for my coffee . This is fine until I decide I want a second cup after all ( which is uncommon ) and have a dirty cup. < br />< br /> I have not yet tried a single cup using the gold basket , but I imagine the experience is similar to the K cup. < br />< br /> Brewing on the carafe side : This is pretty standard fare . The coffee is hot and tasty . I have n't used a standard percolator coffee pot for a carafe in ages , so it 's hard for me to compare this to other models on the market. < br />< br /> In the end , the big selling point of this machine is its diversity in brewing . I 'd often get irritated having only a Keurig and then finding myself with a house full of people wanting coffee ... one cup at a time and with expensive K Cups or messy and difficult reusable K cups . The flexible brewing options are wonderful to have , but the limitations on the ability to cut off the water supply are certainly noteworthy .#### #### ####[([131], [140], 'POS'), ([225], [222], 'POS'), ([121], [120], 'POS'), ([148], [153], 'POS'), ([225], [233], 'POS')]

Great pocket-size scale - makes it a lot easier to measure herbs when you need to be precise . This comes with a clear protective cover the same size as the unit that can be flipped over and used as a container to measure from . Nice and cheap , and seems accurate so far .

Cuisinart HM-90BCS Power Advantage Plus 9-Speed Handheld Mixer with Storage Case , Brushed Chrome < br />< br /> What an ingenious idea . I was sold on this the moment I saw it . I have all kinds of little parts belonging to various kitchen gadgets and machines floating around my kitchen . Not the parts for this mixer , though . They all store right in the accompanying clear case which comes with and attaches to the mixer . Brilliant ! It deserves an award for this feature alone. < br />< br /> But there 's more . It is a very good hand mixer . We use this whenever we do n't need ( or are too lazy for ) the big Kitchen Aid ( which seems to be more and more lately since we 've gotten this hand mixer ).< br />< br /> Functions well , stows like a dream , and fairly priced .

It turns out to work better than I had hoped . I use it to cut my apples , and then once I remove the cores , I place the cut pieces on a countertop . There , I again use this apple slicer to dice my apples from their neatly cut shapes . It 's really great when I fry my apples in their diced configuration. < br />< br /> If you are overweight , as I remain , then use this tool daily to cut and then dice your apples . Either fry or microwave them until soft or nearly soft , depending on your preference . I use cinnamon on them when frying . When micro waving , I add chili sauce nears the end of the microwave cycle. < br /> Then I have a bowl of these cut and cooked apples to eat during the day , grazing as I cut my appetite . Yes , I 'm losing weight .#### #### ####[([108], [103], 'POS'), ([108], [100], 'POS'), ([66], [57], 'POS'), ([84], [75], 'POS')]

I have had this microwave for just over 3 years and the door wo n't close , or the microwave does n't know that the door is closed so it wo n't turn on . It is rather irritating to be having to keep slamming and pressing and shaking the door to make it start . Many a times we end up heating / cooking on the stove . I do not think it is worth the over $ 100 we have to pay for it and throw it after 2-3 years .

This stainless steel bottle from Tiger holds 16 oz. of liquid . It is insulated which allows hot liquid to stay hot for approximately 8 hours and cold liquid to stay cold for less than 8 hours . I put a couple cubes of ice in with water and keep it nearby for regular hydration . It is nice to look at and tapers in at the bottom to fit most standard cup holders . You push the button in the middle of the lid to open the gasket and release the liquid to drink . You can push it half way down and it will stay open . I found this just a bit awkward but it is easy enough to operate . I put it in the dish washer to clean and had no problems . Cleaning the lid can get a bit tricky .#### #### ####[([44], [53], 'NEU'), ([144], [145], 'NEU'), ([140], [145], 'NEU'), ([78], [71], 'NEU')]

I received this at a discount in return for a review . I have been using a lot of lemons lately to make goat cheese and I needed something that made juicing lemons easier . This does do the job , but barely . The plunger does n't line up well with the cup , so some of the lemons do n't get crushed all the way . The picture on the box showed an apple , but I do n't think it would work for a harder fruit like apples . It is made in China and does seems kind of cheaply made . I was not happy with it and have returned it to Amazon . I 'm going to try an electric juicer instead .#### #### ####[([88], [87], 'NEU'), ([90], [87], 'NEU'), ([96], [87], 'NEU')]

This is an excelllent electric kettle . I use it for Argentinean mate , coffee several times a day . It is very practical as well and nice looking .

Let me first say , that I almost never leave a review that ’s positive , because I think something is SUPPOSED to work as described , and that does n’t warrant a pat on the head , so when something does what it ’s supposed to I pretty much just move on with my life . Things should n’t require modification or repair to do what the manufacturer claims it is supposed to do right out of the box . Having that been said , I just abused the crap out of this thing and it beat me . You guys like popcorn , I LOVE popcorn ( Pizza , Beer , Popcorn and a good movie do n’t always require a date as far as I ’m concerned ; almost just as great all by itself ) . No , I do n’t plan to live to be 46 , but I also rarely indulge in any of the above ( though , those days might be over now ).< br />< br /> Construction < br /> I miss real Stainless Steel . Farberware is mostly crap now , and almost nothing you buy for under $ 20 is worth the trip to the store ( I ’m talking about one single chef ’s knife , et cetera ; not a set ) . The reason is because there are actually MANY grades of stainless steel ( regardless of what you are making out of it ) and you can CLAIM something is stainless in your advertising EVEN if you use the absolute cheapest grade available . There are items made of grades of stainless that will rust just sitting on a shelf in its packaging , or because of the humidity in the air . Wal-Mart sells a lot of them . However , one thing that Wal-mart does sell is a brand called Tramontina , that is actually a Brazilian Company , and they make their pots like they make their bikini models . Multi-layered bottom ! REAL stainless Steel . I ’ve soaked knives in soapy water for a week in one before ( got busy / stuff came up ) . The knives were done , and the water was rust brown , but the POT was fine ; just had to wash it out – it was like rust would n’t stick to it … THAT’S REAL STAINLESS STEEL !+< br />< br /> I would n’t doubt it at all if the pot portion of this was actually sublet to Tramontina for production ; it ’s built that well . I expected thin sheet metal . One layer ; the kind that everything burns too . The thick bottomed pot you get alone is worth the item price . You can probably use it for a ton of different other things by itself , and it will probably outlast the top / mechanism ( which I also suspect is actually made out of a good grade of Stainless – garbage stainless often comes out of the box with little rust specks in corners of parts , and this is pretty perfect so far ).< br />< br /> Oh , and if you have n’t already heard , MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MODEL WITH METAL GEARS !!!< br />< br /> Delivery – Inside a week , and the item was very well packed. < br />< br /> Experience – First use. < br /> I just popped 8 pots in this in a row ; guys , it actually seems built to do exactly that . After “ seasoning ” the pot with olive oil , I used Orville Redenbacher 100 % Natural Popcorn ( Wal-Mart ) , Act II Buttery Popping & Topping Oil and Mighty Pop Popcorn Salt ( both from Sam ’s Club ) . Once everything warms up you can set your watch by that 5 minute time ( per instructions ) . The first batch I measured everything out and poured it in ( Kernels , Oil , and Salt in that order ) . I spun the handle a few times to mix it all up and waited . After about 3 minutes the first kernels start to pop ( I actually timed it ) , and it ’s done at right around 5 minutes ( on medium heat ) . I then dumped it into a bowl and reloaded everything , EYEBALLING the ingredients every time after that . After the first batch I looked in the pot and thought for sure all the “ stuff ” left in the pot would burn on the next run . So I decided that I would keep reloading components by eye and run it until something burned . Nothing ever did. < br />< br /> I kept the burner on medium , and just took the pot off to dump and reload . I kept pouring about the same amounts of kernels , then about the same oil / topping , and sprinkling the same amount of salt , then turning the handle to mix it up . CONSISTENTLY , Iwould wait 3 minutes and then hear the first pop ( I might have spun the handle once after mixing just to move things around once ) . After the first pop I then moderately turned the handle until I could n’t anymore ( think 1 spin for every “ One-one-thousand ” count ) . DON’T FORCE THE HANDLE ! Just take the whole thing off the stove , ( I would hover it over the burner and movie it in circles as the last kernels popped ; see the tip below ) and let it stop popping . Then reload or shut-off the stove. < br />< br /> I could have kept going , but gave up after the eighth batch . After it cooled , I wiped the pot out with paper towels , wiped down the top and stirring mechanism real good , reassembled it and placed it in a brand new Kitchen garbage bag to help keep the dust out of it . I ’m pretty retentive about cleanliness ; I hand scrub my dirty dishes thoroughly before putting them in the dishwasher ( use it as a sanitizer ) . But they claim that if you use this once a week you do n’t have to clean it out , which makes sense since you are mostly talking about steam , oil , and hard kernel shells / skin ( like an abrasive ) ever touching the cooking surface . I plan to wash it monthly because oil does go rancid after a while , but the more the oil stays on it the less likely it is to ever rust . It ’s like a cast Iron Skillet , you season it , and then you care for it a little differently than other pots & Pans. < br />< br /> A few tips < br /> Try not to over fill it because it will bind up the handle once everything pops , but if you take it off the burner once the popcorn starts coming out the lid , you probably wo n’t burn anything , you just end up with more un-popped kernels ( which you could probably actually save and try popping later , but I think that ’s a little unsanitary myself. )< br />< br /> Do n’t slide it back and forth across the burner like the old Jiffy Pop “ pie pan with a handle ” packs of popcorn you would make on the burner and that would expand into a big foil bubble as the popcorn popped . BUT , once the popcorn popping slows down , I make the same motion with the pot about an inch above the burner . This way , any kernels that were JUST about to pop , but might not have because the heat was removed , still get a little heat applied to them , but the popped popcorn does n’t get burned. < br />< br /> I ’m not excited about putting the top / mechanism through the dishwasher , but the bottom pot could basically LIVE there . Very sturdy ( think decent Wolfgang Puck / Emeril pots and pans quality – definitely not the lowest grade , but not $ 100 per piece either ).< br />< br /> One Complaint < br /> My one minor , minor gripe ; when you go to dump the popcorn , sometimes both flaps open unexpectedly and you make a mess . The bottom is heavy duty as I said above , and the first part of that is HEAVY . For its size , it takes a bit of wrist muscle to deal with this one handed , and when you go to shake out the popped popcorn you have to remember that the handle itself is attached to the TOP mechanism . The top is only attached to the bottom by two spring clips built onto the top mechanism . A third spring clip holds the one flap closed while the other flap is free to open , allowing the finished popcorn to come out and pour into a bowl . If you have to shake out the popcorn to pour it into a bowl , the bottom begins to slide off of the top . The spring clips appear to begin to slide off the bottom pan ( though it is actually the weight of the bottom pan pulling it off the top ) , and the spring clip holding the other flap moves away from the bottom pot , allowing it to release. < br />< br /> The solution is simple – either take off the top and pour the popcorn into a bowl using oven mitts ( it ’s HOT ! ) OR just using one oven mitt / pot holder , support the side of the bottom pot with one hand as you shake it with the other ( will probably better reduce wear and tear on the spring clips over time versus removing it every time ) . Not a big deal , but it could be called a flaw in the design I guess. < br />< br /> Final Word < br /> I do n’t do infomercials every time I buy something … In fact , I could probably make a living doing angry A-hole reviews of things that turn out to be crap . I bought this , it was n’t sent to me for free to review . I just had to share my experience so far because I honestly have n’t bought anything for the kitchen in a VERY long time ( at least a decade ) that I was this pleased with ! same motion with the pot about an inch above the burner .

If you 're using any other water filter than ZeroWater , then you are missing out on a better product . I live in Camden , NJ where the tap water is terribly horrible .

It took a few minutes to figure out how to put it together and get it to grind somewhere between chunks and dust , but eventually I ground coffee with it . I 'd have done better if there was some sort of code on the grind control to give some hint of where to set it for the grind that I like , but I can do that at home with a marker , I suppose . It takes some work , and about five minutes ( after the grind adjustment ) , but it does grind coffee pretty much the way you want .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS')]

This is a decent comfort mat . It seems to be made well and will probably last for a long time . It 's a bit too soft for me - I wish it had just a bit more support . This is definitely for the home rather than for commercial use. < br />< br /> I use it in my bakeshop and it cleans up easily . There is n't much grip underneath though , so it does tend to slide around . You can put one of those carpet pads under it if you want it to stay put. < br />< br /> I wish it was longer to cover the length of my baker 's workbench . This size is more suitable for keeping by the sink or an area where you pretty much work standing in one spot .#### #### ####[([39], [38], 'NEU'), ([120], [126], 'NEU')]
My true rating is 4.75 < br /> Accuracy 5 < br /> Speed 4 < br /> Quality 4.5 < br /> Price 5 < br />< br /> Pros :< br /> 1 ) Quick read , I would estimate 12-15 seconds ( I have yet to see the 4-7 they claim )< br /> 2 ) Accurate < br /> 3 ) Hold feature < br /> 4 ) Auto shutoff < br />< br /> Cons < br /> 1 ) Could be as fast as they claim ( Still fast from my perspective which is why I also listed the speed as a pro )< br /> 2 ) Not back lit ( Fine in low lighting but would be difficult to use in little or no lighting )< br />< br /> I have tried a couple of other thermometers in this price range and they were both pretty much worthless ( You could come back 2 minutes later and the temperature would still be increasing ) , so I was starting to believe that I needed to spend the $ 100 and just get the Thermapen that every chef on TV seems to own . I was between this one and the version from lava due to them both claiming accuracy to within 1 degree and about the same read time ( 4-7 seconds ) . Since I just wasted money on a worthless one I decided to save the $ 5 and get this one . Perhaps the Lava version is better and it does have a handy magnet , I have n't tried that one yet but will update if I do . I will say that I am very happy with this thermometer .#### #### ####[([132], [129], 'POS'), ([257], [259], 'POS'), ([256], [259], 'POS')]

I never thought that as simple as this bottle is , that it would become my new favorite infuser and drinking bottle , but it has ! It 's so beautiful and really high-quality . The glass is thick and it has a double glass design ( rounded bottom glass inside of the actual glass bottle ) . I love the bamboo top ; it really makes the bottle stand out and look really unique. < br />< br /> I love how the infuser basket sits on top and easily removable . For fruit , you 'd put it below the infuser basket and for loose leaf tea ( what I use it for the most ) , you 'd put it above / on top of the infuser basket so you can remove it once brewed and throw away . There is a little handle so you can put the basket right out. < br />< br /> I will admit that with some loose leaf teas , smaller pieces do pass through the basket . This is nothing against the bottle since it 's the actual tea company that is providing the small pieces . However , it 's not much of a big deal ; I do n't mind drinking tiny pieces of herbs. < br />< br /> I ca n't say enough good things about this bottle . It 's great for both hot and cold drinks . I have n't put it in the microwave either and probably wo n't . I usually just heat my water in a separate container and pour it in over the tea leaves . It 's a very versatile bottle that would also make a great gift. < br />< br /> I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest , unbiased review . All opinions are 100 % mine .#### #### ####[([108], [106], 'POS'), ([21], [16], 'POS'), ([168], [166], 'POS'), ([263], [266], 'POS')]

Billy 's Vegan wife here ..... I had a small salad spinner that worked okay for the daily ( or twice daily ) salad , but for the past few years , I 've grown a large garden wtj lots of greens and herbs , and needed a larger spinner to handle high volumes of basil , thyme , mint etc . I also got tired of rinsing kale and other greens in small batches or using a large washtub and colander . I decided to try this Brieftons Salad Spinner as I do n't like the kinds where you pull a handle on a string AND my little &# 34 ; push the plunger on the top &# 34 ; spinner takes a fair amount of muscle AND it is quite noisy . I really like this new larger salad spinner and here 's why :< br />< br /> Pros :< br /> 1 . Large enough for large batches ( i.e. if you had a large family to feed or a big garden to process )< br /> 2 . Handle is easy to push down and the spinner is quiet. < br /> 3 . No plunger in the center that gets in the way or your greens. < br /> 4 . Holes in the drainer basket are large enough for big chunks of dirt to come out and easier to clean than a finer mesh. < br /> 5 . Price was reasonable - the price for a competitor 's spinner at Whole Foods scared me !< br />< br /> Cons :< br /> 1 . The button you push to lock or unlock the handle for storage is very stiff . I just leave mine &# 34 ; unlocked &# 34 ; and set it on top of a high shelf for storage. < br /> 2 . It does n't seem like it spins as fast as my smaller spinner - but things still get pretty dry , to I guess that 's not really an issue < br /> 3 . The &# 34 ; brake &# 34 ; button does n't slow down the spinner very quickly and emits that plastic-on-plastic squeak . I usually do n't bother to use it . I just let it spin down while I 'm chopping or prepping something else. < br />< br /> I would definitely recommend this spinner - It 's worth making space in your cabinet .#### #### ####[([37], [36], 'POS'), ([79], [78], 'POS')]

The pros : I really love the color of this brewer and it 's a great addition to my kitchen . I love the touch display aspect and that there 's a hot water function . I also like there 's a function to make the coffee strong. < br />< br /> The qualms I have with the 2.0 brewer is that ( 1 ) the water filter can be a little bit tricky to put on especially when it 's full of water - I 've spilled a couple times but this could be because I need to get use to the new configuration ; ( 2 ) not all K-cups work in the brewer that should ( Meza coffee brand for one ) ; and ( 3 ) there is n't a reusable pod for it at this moment I 'm writing this review so you have to buy pods. < br />< br /> I originally was going to keep this brewer at home but I 've decided to take it in the office instead .

The spoons are great , however , I was n't able to open the ring to use one spoon at a time . The ring was super tight . Had to enlist the help of my husband to open the ring and he even had a hard time opening it . I do n't plan to store the spoons on the ring . The company asked for my feedback on the product and when I told them about the ring problem , the reply was &# 34 ; What i can tell you is to find the best way to open the ring , you can try to pull open the ring connector from the upper and lower sides firstly &# 34 ; .#### #### ####[([98], [97], 'NEU'), ([14], [10], 'NEU')]

I 'd really love to give this 5 stars . I needed an ice holder for my office . The size is perfect . Love that it has a scoop , although as others have said , you do have to tilt the bucket to get a scoop full of ice out . The scoop is n't deep enough to keep the ice from sliding off back into the bucket if you try it with the bucket sitting flat on a surface . I really wish it had a carry handle . There are carrying &# 34 ; tabs &# 34 ; on both side , but they require one to use two hands to carry it . A hinged handle would be a great improvement . However , the thing that kept me from rating it higher is that the lid does not &# 34 ; pop open &# 34 ; as advertised . When you remove the scoop from its holder , the lid opens about 1 / 4 &# 34 ; . You have to manually open it - the spring just does n't do the trick . So again , you have to put down your cup to use your hand to open it . Although as you have to use 2 hands to scoop out ice anyway , maybe it 's not such a big deal .#### #### ####[([14], [22], 'NEU'), ([20], [22], 'NEU'), ([230], [229], 'NEU'), ([47], [57], 'NEU'), ([50], [48], 'NEU')]

I was using it for an ice tray . Filling it is very difficult because it is such a flexible material . Popping out the ice also took practice . I lost more pieces than I saved the first time around .

OK . I am actually a little perturbed about the fact that I have been cooking for as long as I have and I have never had one of these ! This is insane. < br />< br /> But ! This is freaking genius !! ! Omgaaaawd how cool is this ?! ! It 's . A. Pot . Lid . With . A. Timer. < br />< br /> I do all of the cooking , and it 's usually three times a day . Since I do cook that much , there 's usually multiple things on my stove at the same time . This ? This is going to be amazing . Forever . It fits not just one pot , but A lot of them . It 's not like other said swear one specific lid goes to one specific pot , this fits many ! If you ca n't feel my excitement , I am clearly writing it wrong . Because this is maybe my new favorite kitchen gadget. < br />< br /> The timer on this is amazing , I ca n't even believe this . I ca n't even believe I have gone this long in my life without a silicone pot lid that has a timer . Someone is getting yelled that , probably my husband , just because I feel like I have been missing out on this awesomeness for such a long time. < br />< br /> Oh . And guess what my favorite color in the whole wide world is ! ? Yes . Pink ... The ONLY thing they could make this better is if it had glitter . I do know of course that is not possible , but ! One can only hope . Maybe the next design will have glitter in it ! LOL < br />< br /> Omg I love it so much ... It is really just amazing . And I 'm shocked did I have never seen anything like this . And I go to the kitchen store a lot , and I have n't seen this . I would 've had it ! Does n't matter , I have it now .

I wanted to love this but there are too many negatives . 1 ) does not work with re-usable cups like ez-cup . 2 ) I know there is the basket for ground coffee , and it works OK , but the pain in the neck and mess of cleaning it for every cup of coffee makes it an unattractive option . I wanted to use the refillable cups with the little filters . 3 ) this is the worst one ... It started having problems after just two days of use . Only half of water came out , or none ; cleaning the cup piercer thing helped , but this fix only lasted for two or three more cups ; sometimes unplugging it and plugging it back in seemed to fix the problem , sometimes not . I spent two hours yesterday and a wasted a whole bunch if k-cups trying to convince it to make a cup of coffee . This morning it worked for the first two cups , and then got temperamental again . It is going in the rubbish if hamilton beach will not refund my money . ( Did not buy at amazon . )#### #### ####[([68], [71], 'NEG'), ([68], [67], 'NEG'), ([45], [38], 'NEG')]
Wow , I had no idea that the WildSide jar could make such a difference . I had to replace the jar that came with the unit , so paid extra for this one . I 'm so glad that I did .

We eat SUSHI and these are great ! It is a big pack of sushi stick which I could n't find in the small little overpriced town of Elko Nevada .

Save money , time , and frustration by using these platetoppers rather than plastic wrap . Set of 2 platetoppers . Dishwasher , microwave , and refrigerator safe . The platetopper is excellent for storing a plate of leftovers in the fridge , then reheating them in the microwave . Platetopper creates an airtight seal over your dinner plate . Before microwaving , make sure to vent the plate with the pull tab first . Keeps your microwave clean from splatters . Dishwasher safe , easy clean up . I love these platetoppers . Plastic wrap is such a pain , these you just put over your plate and press down on the top for an airtight seal . Keeps your food fresher longer . Then to reheat your food vent the plate with the handy pull tab and microwave . So easy . I have two old microwave plate covers , and they are both melting . They do not create any type of seal for leftovers , and take up a lot of space in the cabinet. < br /> I received this product at A discount in exchange for my unbiased review .

For some reason , I have three boning knives in my kitchen , and now there are four . I actually use my boning knives for more than boning meat ; they 're excellent tomato and thin skinned fruit knives , cheese knives , and watery vegetable ( like eggplant and squash ) knives . I like the thin flexible blades. < br />< br /> The KitchenAid , with one tiny drawback , blows my other knives off the counter . It 's heavy . You know you 've got a serious piece of kitchen equipment in your hand . It 's full tang , which is non negotiable for my knives . It needed a bit of sharpening , but that 's to be expected. < br />< br /> So far , I 've sliced tomatoes , garlic , and cucumbers paper thin , deboned a pork roast , and tonight I 'm de boning several pounds of chicken thighs . As a kitchen nerd , I ca n't wait !< br />< br /> The tiny drawback I mentioned earlier ? The handle is a bit skinny . It 's not a problem , I would just have preferred a slightly bigger gripping surface .#### #### ####[([38], [36], 'POS'), ([67], [71], 'POS'), ([93], [92], 'POS'), ([96], [103], 'POS'), ([72], [71], 'POS')]

These scoops are awesome . I got them specifically for baking . They are perfectly portioned . This set came with 3 different sized stainless steel scoops . I use the large one for cupcake batter , the medium and small for cookies . The medium is 2 table spoons and the small is 1 table spoon .

I ’ve been through a few grinders , but it did n’t last . The quality of this grinder is much better and the teeth and metal components feel a lot more durable . Other grinders I had chipped soon after it was used . One premium grinder I had was two times the price of this one and the quality of the Quantum Crush grinder is on par , if not better .

Very disappointed . Wanted to jump on the ' healthy pasta ' train . Washed the Veggetti and began using on an average sized zucchini --- basically the vegetable just came out as mush and was n't difficult to use .

It seems like every Thanksgiving , I go to check the temperature of my turkey in the oven and my thermometer either takes way too long to give me a reading or I find out that my thermometer does n't work . I wanted a thermometer that gave me a very quick and accurate temperature reading of my food so I do n't lose heat from the oven and add additional cooking time . I received this thermometer and this is my first time using a digital thermometer so I did n't know what to expect . I was very pleased with the results . I put the thermometer in my baked chicken and got a temperature reading very quickly . The probe is long enough to get the center of a thick cut of meat and does n't require you to get your hands to close to the hot food you are cooking . The thermometer comes complete with a battery installed so it is ready to use right out of the box and comes with a nice storage holder to prevent damage inside your kitchen drawers. < br />< br /> Pros :< br /> Long probe to prevent burns on hands < br /> Fast temperature display < br /> Ready to use out of the box < br /> Storage sleeve < br />< br /> Cons :< br /> Small buttons < br />< br /> I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review .

In short , the Spiralizer has made all my food dreams come true . I first discovered a spiralizer when my friend invited me over and whipped up a super quick , super delicious zucchini noodle pad thai . I asked her where she bought it and she said Sur La Table . Unfortunately , I do n't live anywhere near a Sur La Table , but fortunately we live in a world where you can buy pretty much anything online. < br />< br /> I read over tons of reviews on Amazon comparing the highest and most rated countertop spiralizers ( from Spiralizer , Paderno and Palermo ) , and the combination of price ($ 6 cheaper than the next best ) and number of detailed reviews made Spiralizer 's win out . I ordered right away and was happy to receive my new appliance two days early ( that 's two more days of my life spent spiralizing )!< br />< br /> The blades are super sharp , and while the construction may not be anything glamorous , it absolutely gets the job done . It 's not too difficult to figure out , fun to use , and super simple to pull apart and clean ( just be careful on the blades ... seriously , seriously sharp ) . I 'm excited to see just how many vegetables and fruits I can cut up. < br />< br /> There 's only one drawback so far : when I was using it for the second time ( with a zucchini ) , the &# 34 ; lower handle &# 34 ; broke off . I do n't think this will really effect the function of the Spiralizer , but it was surprising because I did n't really apply all that much force . I 'm not too worried about it since there is a lifetime guarantee on parts . All in all , great purchase and I 'm incredibly happy . Spiral on , friends .#### #### ####[([125], [118], 'POS'), ([148], [145], 'POS')]

This is replacing a Laroma brand carafe ([[ ASIN : B000Q4NG88 Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Carafe ]]) , so my comments will compare the two similar items . Both have been used exclusively for keeping coffee hot. < br />< br /> The insulation on this carafe is outstanding . While the exterior of the Laroma carafe would quickly become very warm to the touch , even though I put boiling hot water in the carafe , and it may sit for an hour or more , the exterior remains cool . This shows that the heat is being kept inside rather than leaking through. < br />< br /> But , the comments of other reviewers that this carafe pours slowly are on target . It suffers from a couple of poor design elements which cause that . Primarily it suffers from a very small top opening , only 1.5 inches across . The small opening makes it more difficult to poor the hot liquid in ( and it could be very difficult to get ice cubes in if one was using it for cold beverages ) , and it makes it necessary to turn the pot almost upside down to pour the coffee out . It is like the difference between drinking beer from a pint glass versus from a long neck bottle -- to empty the bottle one must turn it upside down . By comparison , the Laroma has an opening 2.75 inches across , a 50 % increase . As a result , the Laroma profile is more like that of a drinking glass than a beer bottle. < br />< br /> The spout is essentially an open trough . It could guide the coffee into the cup if the carafe was tilted slightly , but when turned far enough to drain the carafe the coffee just flows from the opening in the carafe without benefit of the spout . So long as one is careful it is possible to pour into the cup , but because the carafe has to be inverted directly over the cup it can cast a shadow into the cup and / or block one 's view , making it difficult to pour a full cup without overflowing . The Laroma spout is fully enclosed , like a pipe or nozzle that does a better job keeping the outflowing liquid aligned ( but that design might have problems itself if it had a narrow neck like the Oggi requiring the carafe to be inverted in order to pour ).< br />< br /> The Laroma pot had a thermometer built into the lid which was a nice feature , but since this keeps the coffee hot such a long time it is not critical to know the current temperature. < br />< br /> The Laroma carafe had the lever that opened the seal in the lid break after a couple years of use , but generally seemed to be much sturdier and better quality than this carafe . The Laroma also had a seal fail between the black plastic top portion and stainless steel base after about 6 years of use which resulted in some leakage and motivated us to replace it. < br />< br /> While this is serviceable , and as I said the insulation is excellent , it leaves a lot to be desired . For the price it is a pretty good carafe , but on balance I would have preferred to have paid a bit more to get a better designed product .#### #### ####[([75], [71], 'NEU'), ([83], [90], 'NEU'), ([214], [222], 'NEU'), ([113], [115], 'NEU'), ([293], [283], 'NEU')]

I purchased these as you can never have too many storage containers and these are great because they have multiple sizes within the package .

Pros : No clamping needed , easy to use and reload . nice long horns / tubes , no nylon gears < br /> Cons : welding , polishing of Stainless Steel looks a bit sloppy. < br /> Amazon Prime Day 2015 was my purchase date .

Weston 86-0701-W Manual Vertical Sausage Stuffer , 7-Pound < br />< br /> There were n't any great deals . I did see this unit Weston 86-0701-W Manual Vertical Sausage Stuffer , 7-Pound at Amazon for $ 149.99 . I liked the idea of getting something a bit bigger than a 5 # model , since most of batches are 5 # , I wanted to make sure I was never filling twice . Since then I have had a few 12 # batches , oh well ;-)< br />< br /> First unit that arrived - The first unit that arrived turned out to be a refurbished one . it had nicks and scratches , but worked fine . I only figured it out when I went to register the product and it had a sticker on the warranty card saying it was a refurbished unit . I have bought things from Amazon before that are clearly noted as returns or refurbs . They carry the same Amazon warranties , so I have had good luck with them . But you are told right up front , that the discounted price is due to its condition . On this particular purchase there was no warning . I used it heavily that weekend and then promptly returned it . I felt slighted and cheated - bait and switch. < br />< br /> Second Unit - I then reordered the same unit from Amazon , 10 days later , same price . This one arrived brand spanking new . Full warranty etc . I have used it now 6 times for about 75 # of meat.I have made sticks , sausages and even some 1 1 / 2 &# 34 ; summer sausages. < br />< br /> The unit works fine . I have tried some one man stuffing , but the wife is a willing participant and it goes quicker with two . Could you use it alone ? Yes , but you might want to clamp it down then , it tends to slip just a bit. < br />< br /> Cranking is not too hard , but I am a big guy . I think my wife has cranked it a bit , but would not last with 20 # in one day. < br />< br /> Clean up is rather easy. < br />< br /> Negatives - there is an pressure release spring and cap on the plunger / pusher . It is fastened with a slip washer / pin ( proper name ?) that is a pain to get on and off . It must come on and off for good cleaning , but I risk gauging my fingers each time I take it on or off. < br />< br /> The first couple of times we used it , we had one point about 2 / 3 way down the hpper / bin when cranking got really hard , after a few uses we realized that one of the gear teeth from inside the cabinet had broken a bit off and was stuck in the plunger 's teeth . when i removed that , the cranking issue disappeared . However , there are a couple pieces of teeth that I can hear rattling about in the gear box now . Still works fine , but I made sure to get my warranty in on time . ( Why no online registration Weston ?).< br />< br /> Yes , it does leave a big of meat in the bend and horn / stuffing tube . We have tried adding bread to the hopper to push that through , but have ultimately just used the last meat as little patties and fried them up as a reward for the stuffing work. < br />< br /> Yes , I would recommend this project.my wife has cranked it a bit , but would not last with 20 # in one day. < br />< br /> Clean up is rather easy. < br />< br /> Negatives - there is an pressure release spring and cap on the plunger / pusher .

I bought these because I wanted an ice cube tray that would n't break . I do n't think they will , but I wish I had read ( and believed ) the reviews . You ca n't twist the tray and then dump out all the cubes at once like the plastic trays . This should be obvious , but I did n't realize just how labor intensive it would be to get the ice cubes out . You have to pull the tray back with your fingers while pushing the cube out with your thumbs . It 's not easy and it takes forever to do the whole tray . If you only use one cube at a time , it 's probably fine to use these trays . I always use more than one cube at a time though and often want to dump the whole tray into a container and refill the tray so I have more ice in the freezer . So this is not a good tray for me .#### #### ####[([117], [125], 'NEU'), ([120], [125], 'NEU'), ([117], [109], 'NEU'), ([140], [148], 'NEU')]
It 's a wonderful toaster and we like the number system for choosing how dark the toast should be . It does n't work too well for toasting pita bread . That 's true for all toasters but I 'd hope I could toast the pita in the &# 34 ; oven &# 34 ; , but that does n't work . The oven is an oven , not a toaster. < br /> In the model I purchased , there is also a minor problem with the oven , When you open the door to remove the food in there , the wire rack in there does not come out by being attached to a hook on the dor as most toaster ovens do . It 's very awkward and I even burned my finger the first time I tried to remove something , even though I had a mitt on the hand I was using.The problem was that the rack and the tray both came out and I tried to grab the rack and of course it was very hot . The book of instructions that comes with it makes it look like there is the hook on the door , but it is n't there . Aside from these problems , it works well . Just be careful .#### #### ####[([138], [137], 'NEU'), ([123], [129], 'NEU'), ([4], [14], 'NEU'), ([10], [14], 'NEU'), ([177], [181], 'NEU')]

I just used my slicer for the first time to slice a zuchinni and a carrot . I used the side that makes long skinny strings and < br /> sliced it into a bowl .

It 's a Vietnamese espresso pot . It is a couple of simple metal pieces just like the ones you get at the Asian grocery store . When I ordered it I was worried that espresso grounds would still get through the little holes , but I 've yet to see that happen . However , it is important to note that I will only add a tbsp of hot water when I 'm first filling the pot . Then I wait half a minute and only then do I fill the entire pot .

Just what I wanted - a sharpener which works well , stows easily in a drawer , and does not need power . I started out many years ago with a ' rat tail ' straight kitchen sharpener . It sort of worked . After two powered sharpeners I gave this a try . My knives were nothing outstanding before and after a few swipes through this device became a joy to use . Fair warning - if your knives are really dull , you may want to first give them a few passes through a powered sharpener to get a starter edge . After that , put it away . This tool should be used regularly for maintaining that perfect edge - it only takes two or three swipes with light pressure to keep the edge . Now my knife practically falls through onions being diced and soft tomatoes are not a problem . I cut myself once and learned - it leaves a very sharp edge . The bottom is padded and can be used on any surface . This thing is a keeper .#### #### ####[([21], [26], 'POS'), ([140], [148], 'POS'), ([64], [58], 'POS')]
Bought as a gift , and it was well received . Well made and functions as advertised . Compared with one of the TV hyped units a friend has , and this seems to be at least as good .

I normally sharpen knives using 5 different grits of diamond plates , but this sharpener works great for putting a quick edge on you knife .

I use this primarily as a strainer for my cold brew coffee because I have had a really terrible experience with the cold brew bags , but I 've made a few pour overs with this as well. < br />< br /> Its a absolute delight , it allows the coffee flavor to take front and center without imparting any additional flavor to it , the strainer is fine enough to catch fairly finely ground coffee although my advice is to use a coarser grind just so that your coffee does n't over steep or get clogged. < br />< br /> Clean-up is a sinch , just rinse it under water and you 're done . Nothing else needed. < br />< br /> Build quality is superb and no more garbage cans filled with paper filters or pre-rinsing filters .#### #### ####[([19], [18], 'POS'), ([138], [129], 'POS'), ([67], [61], 'POS'), ([67], [69], 'POS'), ([23], [22], 'POS')]

I have been a neat freak most of my life and I remember one of my biggest issues as a child was the Tupperware ® cabinet at my mothers house . It seemed like there was never a matching lid and always a mess looking for one . This product really does solve that problem . The lids snap nicely on top of each other and the bottoms of the containers also snap onto the top of the lid . That solves 2 problems at once . The first is easy and clean storage , second it makes it easy to not loose the lid when you take it off especially if you are the type to carry lunch to work or any other reason you might take them out of your home. < br />< br /> I use these both at home and in a professional kitchen for many types of food storage and easy organization . After one year of using the same few sets I purchased at the same time I am still very satisfied with the product . One problem I had with a similar product before finding this set was the lids or bottom of the container would loose their ability to snap together . I figure from the plastic wearing down or getting misshaped for whatever reason . To date that has not been a problem . One thing I would warn you of is microwaving food in these containers does not seem to be a great idea . I have noticed that the plastic will stain from it , seems to almost melt a little . I realize they claim to be microwave safe but I have had problems with that . I can honestly say this is the best set of food storage containers I have come across in both my personal and a long professional career in the restaurant business . I would easily recommend this product to anyone looking for a solution to their messy cupboards or who are tired of not having a lid to match their food storage containers .#### #### ####[([157], [147], 'POS'), ([23], [16], 'POS'), ([9], [4], 'POS'), ([157], [150], 'POS'), ([173], [178], 'POS')]

This product grills well .... but if you are cooking several burgers at the same time the grease pan fills up way too fast .

this does what I want it to do I make a cup of coffee at a time.I like the way you set it and start it and it will shut itself off.You take the the container out and pour into the filter and pour your hot water.This is also very easy to keep clean after each use.I have never used it to make 10 or 12 cups of coffee so I ca n't say that it really does a good job at that time.I am sure it would do a good job for you at 10 or 12 cups coffee .#### #### ####[([99], [90], 'POS')]

I have two mashers in my kitchen and neither are ideal or much to look at . Both have short rubber handles , one with a metal rod that curves back and forth and the other uses a plastic grid . The metal one leaves big chunks and makes you work to get a smooth consistency , the other is a pain to clean. < br />< br /> The Mexican Kitchen masher on the other hand looks refined , uses silicon for a good grip , wood for style and strength , and metal for the business end . The L-shaped design lets you push down straight to get some &# 34 ; oomph &# 34 ; or a rocking motion to work whatever you 're mashing to a smooth texture . It 's tall , giving you leverage and allowing you to store it in an utensil container ( if not , you can hang it from a hook ) .#### #### ####[([20], [19], 'POS'), ([139], [130], 'POS'), ([39], [35], 'POS'), ([72], [70], 'POS')]

the catamount popcorn with silicone handle is very frustrating and the handle does get very hot ! ! it takes a very long time for the popcorn to pop , and yes we even tried putting the empty container in micro for 1 minute before we started to pop the corn ... we previously had the one with the glass handle and we LOVED it ... wish we had never bought this popper ! !#### #### ####[([38], [37], 'NEG'), ([2], [8], 'NEG'), ([4], [8], 'NEG')]
Initially looked to be a satisfying grinder , worked well for about a month . After grinding some beans I roasted ( on the light side so a little hard ) the ceramic mechanism became wedged shut and the nut where the handle attached started stripping . I stopped , took it apart , cleaned it , and after grinding some softer beans the problem started up again . It gets wedged shut and needs to be struck mightily with some sort of hammer . I would n't buy this grinder unless you only plan on grinding store-bought fairly cheap coffee . Then it would be great . I 've thrown it to the back of the cupboard and will deal with it later .#### #### ####[([90], [99], 'NEG'), ([100], [99], 'NEG'), ([64], [61], 'NEG'), ([42], [32], 'NEG')]

I love this thing ! Replaced my flat wooden tray that had edges all around with this tray . It is Very sturdy . The legs are angled outward till they come to a stop . They however do not ' lock ' into position ( which would have been nice ) , this can cause the tray to collapse if you push on it sideways to much without supporting the legs with your hands first . This has not been a problem with me I think because the legs are between my legs preventing too much movement left or right . The height of the legs are adjustable and lock with the turn of a small knob on each side of the leg for a total of four locking knobs . Now , from the underside of the tray to the minimum set height it is about 7 inches clearance , with the legs fully extended you get about 10 1 / 2 inches clearance . I have mine set at about 8 inches and it is very comfortable . So far I have used this in bed with my laptop or while eating . No issues with the laptop . The table has 5 easily and sturdy adjustment angles from approximately 20 degrees ( lowest angled setting ) to about a 35 degree angle . When I have food items on the tray ( flat ) , cups , plates etc , they tend to slide easily on the slick lacquered wood . Have n't had a use for the drawer yet , but I do push it back in often when I lift the tray from the opposite side . It has a stop on it from coming out completely . Why they did n't do this with the drawer in is any ones guess .#### #### ####[([286], [280], 'POS'), ([214], [208], 'POS'), ([209], [208], 'POS'), ([259], [251], 'POS'), ([113], [108], 'POS')]

This is a really cute little coffee jar and is exactly what it says it is ... almost . It is ivory with black letters and is very air tight . It looks nice . BUT , I ordered it because it was the only one I could find that held 28 oz .... just a bit more than a can of coffee . I was disappointed to find it was more the size of a girthy mug . I assume there is a mistake in the item description and it is meant to say EIGHT oz , not 28 . The catalog team has been allegedly notified and as long as the listed capacity becomes accurate ( to ensure you get what you want ) , this is very nice . It 's way too small for me , though .#### #### ####[([73], [66], 'NEU')]

A very easy to use digital thermometer . Turns on and off automatically when the probe is swiveled out or in . Not instant read but only takes a few seconds to reach a stable reading . Very ergonomic . Takes ( 1 ) AAA battery that is very accessible and easy to replace . Best of all : a GREAT VALUE . We had a small issue with our initial unit . I emailed Palermo on a Sunday - they responded in just a few hours ( same day ) then mailed me a new unit on Monday , which I received ( 2 ) days later . No questions asked . . . no hassle .

The pros are the price , the coffee is good , but there is one BIG ANNOYING con which is that the measuring gauge on the water reservoir is in dark transparent plastic so it makes reading the water level extremely difficult , if not even impossible . I had a different coffee pot that looked exactly the same as this one ( I think it was a Hamilton Beach ) , which I had had for 7 years and it was still going strong when I moved overseas last year . Now this year I 'm back in the US and had to buy a new coffee pot and I though I was buying the same one :( it never occurred to me to check the visibility of the water level on the reservoir in the shop ( how can you , though ?! I bought it in Target ) . I know that I can gauge the water by using hte carafe , but I would also like to have the option of the gauge on the water reservoir .#### #### ####[([38], [41], 'NEG'), ([32], [31], 'NEG'), ([7], [9], 'NEG'), ([61], [51], 'NEG')]

Lost the silicone rubber bit on the second use but I have used it about 6 times since and it is accurate . UPDATE : I 've been using it since I purchased it in June 2015 , it is now March 2016 and it 's complete garbage . And I 'm only now just getting around to writing this update . For whatever reason the thermometer reads ridiculously high temperatures . As soon as you turn it on and sync it reads some random temps from usually 10 deg above room temp to 170 deg f. . Ive tried on multiple devices and I get the same results . JUNK ! The worst part about this is that although it has only been in use for 9 months ( maybe used 25 times in that period ) I am unable to return it .

The easiest method of making cold brew coffee I 've encountered . Cleanup is quick , the coffee is great . I learned pretty quickly that the top of the bag is tapered to a size that nicely fits around the mouth of a mason jar , which makes it really easy to get coffee on . I usually fill the jar when the sock is still around the mouth ( 1 cup to 3 cups , coffee to water ) , just to ensure the grounds get an even bloom before I let it steep ( 18-ish hours ).< br />< br /> I 'm reading a few other reviews on here , and wanted to speak to them : first , the glass ring is , well , glass . Nice aesthetic touch , but could definitely break . I 'm being carful with it for sure . Second , this does n't make a weak batch of cold brew . If it did , it 's because the user either did n't ( 1 ) bloom the coffee , ( 2 ) let it steep long enough , or ( 3 ) used too much water and not enough coffee. < br />< br /> In conclusion , compared to a bigger and bulkier cold brew apparatus , this thing is super simple , taking up far less space in the cabinet . Cleanup is a snap , coffee is delicious . Highly recommend .#### #### ####[([6], [14], 'POS'), ([209], [214], 'POS'), ([222], [216], 'POS'), ([161], [160], 'POS')]

This thing is a work of art . The stainless is nicely crafted and keeps the drink either cold or hot for 1-2 hrs .

Even though it is recommended to clean this pitcher by hand ( I do n't even think about it ) I put it in the dishwasher , place two cheap wooden cutting boards around it and voila , it comes out nice and clean for another round of ... what am I in the mood for today . Some days it is colorful berries , the next cucumbers , or I go minimalistic with a pice of Japanese coal in it . For sure a conversation starter when I call it a fat dried worm to gross people out , which cracks me up , and can enlighten my friends later that tap water should be clarified . My pitcher supports my mischievousness as well as my sense for style and variation in flavor , it plays along with everything except my French or Italian sirups that would be too sugary for the lid . No despair , one can easily add the sirup to the glass plus lick the spoon clean for the extra flavor explosion . Thank you pitcher for the additional 4 calories , they do sweeten my day as do you . Oh , by the way , I ordered a second pitcher after I loved the first so much but did n't like the waiting time when the dishwasher was doing its job . I did mention I am lazy , right ?#### #### ####[([166], [169], 'POS'), ([112], [119], 'POS')]

Nice , sturdy , very sharp . Much sharper than expected , which means it really does have 2 functions unlike my previous spreader that would rip my English muffins . I like the way the handle is mounted onto the blade , with no crevices , no joint lines , nothing porous where water and dirt can reside . It also feels like a product that will last years .#### #### ####[([54], [52], 'POS'), ([23], [22], 'POS'), ([51], [52], 'POS')]
This is a very handy product . I have been using a Fagor pressure cooker for quite a while now and am very happy with the two-pot Fagor set I purchased from Amazon after seeing a very positive review in Cooks Illustrated . I wanted to get a new slow cooker and ran into this item - perhaps it was a daily special on Amazon . I have only had it a few weeks but so far it works great . The saute function allows you to cook onions , celery , garlic and carrots in the pot before adding the main ingredients which you can then slow cook or pressure cook as you prefer . You can choose medium or high pressure and you have three heat choices for sauteing and slow cooking . It has several programmed settings which I will learn to use. < br />< br /> As a pressure cooker it has several advantages over the stove-top Fagor. . The main advantage is that you do n't have to stick around the stove while it comes to pressure . You just get the contents ready , select high or low pressure and the time to cook and it does the rest . When the set time is done , it reduces the pressure and goes into keep-warm mode . All of the functions can be halted and different functions started. < br />< br /> It seems to work fine ans a pressure cooker , slow cooker , or rice cooker . Clean-up is a snap as the stainless steel cooking pot slips right out of the cooker and cleans up easily including in the dishwasher . The remaining part of the cooker stays clean and dry and needs almost no care .#### #### ####[([255], [263], 'POS'), ([260], [250], 'POS'), ([5], [4], 'POS'), ([128], [132], 'POS'), ([32], [23], 'POS')]

These straws are a great , durable , alternative to plastic ones and are great for mixed alcoholic and soft drinks alike .

These are great . I was getting ready to throw my magnetic spice rack out because I was so frustrated by the round jars , which I found incredibly difficult to twist or open . I almost always had to use a jar opener ( or a human jar opener - AKA my husband ).< br />< br /> These square jars are so much easier to use . The full lid comes off easily if necessary but stays securely in place . The corners open up if you want to shake a few spices or want a slightly larger flow . I found that the square jars hold all the contents of a standard purchased jar of spices ( if you bang the square jar gently on the counter to make the contents settle as you fill it ).< br />< br /> The black and silver combination also looks good with my fridge , which has a metallic finish on the front and black side panels .#### #### ####[([148], [151], 'POS'), ([53], [60], 'POS'), ([12], [2], 'POS'), ([13], [7], 'POS')]

I love this scale . I really only purchased it initially for the bowl because another reviewer mentioned that it is perfect for melting chocolate over a pot of water . I had to purchase a stainless steel bowl anyhow and I was curious how much a scale would impact my baking so I gave this one a shot . In the past my cakes have often turned out heavier / denser than anticipated , I ca n't say for certain but after making two cakes that came out perfectly using this scale I think that may have had something to do with it . The bowl is the perfect size to melt chocolate over a pot of water. < br />< br /> Ease of use ... I repel technology , and even I figured this out without any help from my husband . It is very easy , turn it on and one button changes it from ounces / grams etc . Also how many battery required items actual include the batteries ? Well this one did ! Also I tested out the weight first and it is precise .#### #### ####[([173], [166], 'POS'), ([13], [21], 'POS'), ([38], [36], 'POS'), ([38], [43], 'POS'), ([177], [170], 'POS')]

Once again , Zojirushi does a great job ! I had another brand of airpot ( an inexpensive push-button brand bought one year ago from a different seller ) , and it was horrible . The stem through which the liquid was pulled up was tiny so many pumps were necessary to dispense one mug , and the stem soon came apart from the pump mechanism . I decided to get a Zojirushi ( I have their bread maker and their hot water heater / dispenser , and love both ) . And the Zoji pot is wonderful .

I once bought a Teavana coffee mug for $ 28 . It did it 's job while it lasted , but about 3 years in , the top rim detached itself from the cover , exposing a styrofoam insert . I was quite confused as I thought I had paid money for the best quality ! After tiredly supergluing the rim to the cover , I finally decided to look for a new coffee mug . I bought 2 from Walmart ( trying to save money ) but they would leak when lifted to the lips . I would just wrap a paper towel around the lid in order to absorb the liquid . Cue the LifeSky Coffee Mug ! First , the seal is super tight ! I have n't had an issue with leakage . It has a lock feature that keeps the lid secured to the canister . Next , the inner lid has a rubber component that also secured the lid to itself . Finally , the entire canister is BPA free and holds 16 oz ( or 2 cups ) liquid . It keeps the liquid hot throughout an 8 hour workday . I am excited to see how this mug holds up , but so far , so good !#### #### ####[([174], [171], 'POS')]

The handles on these scissors look in the photo to be designed ergonomically . However , the design actually makes them very difficult to hold and operate . There is an oval handle and a flattened oval side . For a right handed user the thumb would normally go in the flattened oval side and the index finger in the oval side . My thumb does not fit in the flattened oval side . These scissors have a top and bottom so they cannot be flipped over to resolve this issue .

This is awesome ! I was wary of induction cooking , but needed a &# 34 ; stove &# 34 ; for my daughter who is living downstairs , and there is no 220 outlet for a stove . I had to order a new set of cookware to work with the cooktop , but I ca n't believe how fast this thing cooks . WAY better than a regular hot plate . At first we used my cast iron cookware until the new cookware arrived , and I noticed that , as opposed to my electric range , there were no hot spots on the cast iron skillets . They heated evenly across the bottom . I am finding the same is true with the new stainless steel cookware , and I 'll put a link to what I bought below . This product is well worth the purchase , and I think I 'm going to get another for myself , for canning purposes . My big enamel canner also works fine on the cooktop - but does n't fit so well on my stove. < br />< br /> Here is the cookware that works perfectly with the induction cooktop and is also reasonably prices for the set. < br />< br /> http :// www.amazon.com / gp / product / B007TIN0GW ? redirect = true & ref _= cm _ cr _ ryp _ prd _ ttl _ sol _ 3#### #### ####[([129], [126], 'POS')]

Absolutely , Positively the Best ! I have a friend I used to work with before I retired . He enters barbeque cookoffs all over Texas . This is the digital thermometer he uses . I watched him use this 2 weeks ago at a cookoff in Houston . Steaks were judged by appearance and most important , steaks had to be submitted cooked medium rare ( 134 degrees ) . To make a long story short , he won First Place ! He won $ 1,000.00 . I took a picture of the Thousand Dollar Steak but the picture turned out terrible for some reason so I did n't submit it with this review. < br /> When I got home I told my wife about what I had just witnessed . She said &# 34 ; Maybe you should but a thermometer like Ernie 's so you wo n't screw up my steak every Friday night &# 34 ; . I ordered the Alpha Griller from Amazon that night . Cooked my first steaks last Friday . My wife said it was the best I had cooked in a long time. < br /> It 's easy to use , folds up so you can keep it in your pocket while your cooking . Probably saved my marriage ! Ha-Ha !#### #### ####[([68], [76], 'POS'), ([180], [174], 'POS'), ([68], [74], 'POS'), ([177], [176], 'POS'), ([68], [65], 'POS')]
I used it to grind spices . I had been using an old grinder about once every 3-4 months and the blades had gotten dull over the past 25 + years . Also,the old one had a small capacity and did not have a removable container . I love this one for it 's capacity,and that it ground hard spices like cinnamon,cloves,cardamom etc to a very fine grind . Also love that the container is removable . Hopefully it gives me service for a long time .#### #### ####[([21], [24], 'POS'), ([85], [75], 'POS')]

This does not make snow -- it makes big chunks of ice that are similar to what the fridge ice crusher throws out . It is also hard to crank . One person has to hold the base & cup in place while another person cranks out big chunks of ice . Not a good product .#### #### ####[([50], [47], 'NEG')]

What I like about the dishes : The color is a clear red / cranberry color , the swirly design can go with almost any casual d & eacute ; cor , and they were made from recycled glass . They are pretty , but not beautiful. < br /> What I do n't like : they are on the thicker side and have different flaws such as bubbles , cuts , and inclusions of foreign materials ( small pebbly structures in random places including obvious places on the rims ) as well as the circle in the middle of each plate where it sat through its cooling process at the manufacturing plant. < br /> Overall , I am intending to use these plates for casual meals so they will do . But for the price , I wish they were better made . I want to support an enterprise that is making use of recycled glass to create a potentially useful and beautiful product but it makes me feel like the enterprise is not giving enough attention to producing a quality , superior product. < br /> Thank you .#### #### ####[([5], [11], 'POS'), ([73], [75], 'POS')]

Not sure about the two &# 34 ; rollers &# 34 ; on the right of the sharpener - no instructions - so I do n't know if I 'm supposed to pull the knife straight through them , perpendicular , or if I 'm supposed to angle the knife in some way - the &# 34 ; rollers &# 34 ; make the knife blade want to turn , point inward rather than stay straight , because one is in front of the other slightly .

As God is my witness , I do n't know how this alleged toaster got it 's 4 star review . This thing is horrible . I would call it almost a toy but that would be an insult to toys .

These work exactly as expected . You stick them in your freezer and use them instead of ice cubes .

I am very pleased with the Burlap Banner . It is excellent for the country decorating scheme for a co-ed baby shower . The triangular shapes leave a wide variety of ways to decorate them . I love that advantage . They are a bit smaller than I expected but this gives an opportunity to trim them with lace if I decide to do so . I can either use lettering for a welcome message or attach silk daisies to go with our d & eacute ; cor . It is funny to me to see burlap coming around again as a decorative crafting item . Because of my experience with the fabric I know I could decorate this banner for the party and to display in the baby 's room as burlap is a long lasting decorative piece . The banner can be trimmed with fabric , embroidered on with ribbon , have letters attached to or painted on . There 's really endless possibilities here for parties , weddings , event and fundraising decorations . The cording is very sturdy for hanging the display . It could also be embellished with tiny flowers or ribbon bows for a more feminine or wedding touch .

I have made three or four recipes now and find this to be really useful . I made great veggie noodles , Thai soup , and tasty potato nests . It is easy to use and does really precise spirals . The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the suction system is a little weak , but I placed it inside a cookie sheet and this helped the suction to hold in place better . Also , the knob for the veggie placement on the blades are too high . This does lead to a bit of wastage , as these piece make crescent shapes not spires , but I used them anyway . Would be perfect if it was in the middle of the blades .#### #### ####[([52], [57], 'POS'), ([65], [56], 'POS'), ([28], [26], 'POS')]

My kids ( and husband ) love guitar hero , rock n ' roll , and everything music . I have seen some pretty awesome silicone molds before , and purchased them ... but never one as unique as this one . The &# 34 ; guitar neck / fret &# 34 ; is a really nice feature that sets this mold apart . Makes it a lot of fun if you plan to make chocolate pops , popsicles , or candy . The music notes are small but pretty cool too ! The material is flexible , so you 'll want to use a tray underneath the mold no matter what you are making with it . ( This is the case with any silicone mold , not just this one. I find it to be no big deal . ) The softer material makes it easier to remove your creation , without it breaking or cracking . It is very durable , and I can see this lasting a long time . My kids love when we use this , and even my husband was pretty impressed . This is one of my favorites so far !

As a wine collector of 40 years or so , I 've tried every label removal technique - and I mean everything - heating bottles in the oven , soaking them in hot water , that weird scraper gadget - and as a general rule , for all bottles since 1985 , these label lifters are the way to go . ( For bottles older than 1985 - if you 're lucky enough to still have some - a soak in hot water works the best . I do n't know what happened in ' 86 - perhaps the label adhesives improved - but older labels come right off in hot water , and newer ones do not. )< br />< br /> I agree with other reviewers that the product is expensive , for what amounts to a wide piece of packing tape - but the price has decreased recently . I disagree with those who say you have to wait 2 hours , or 2 days ( really ?) after application . Waiting does n't help . What helps is pressure , with whatever blunt utensil you have handy , and then CAREFUL lifting of one edge while keeping your thumbs firmly pressed on the label . It takes a bit of practice , so do n't be discouraged if you wreck the first label or two . ( Practice on some cheapo bottles before trying to lift that 2000 Lafite label , please ! ) If a hole begins to develop , press that section back down , apply more pressure , and try again . If it still wo n't come up , insert a box cutter blade just behind the area that wo n't adhere to the tape , apply more pressure , and try again . As a last resort , start over from the other side of the label .

I love this electric milk frother ! It is an excellent price , its light weight , and it is powerful ! I have a couple of other frothers and one is a cheap ikea one , and the other was an expensive one that I think I paid $ 20 for ... That one is heavy , but it came with different attachments . I compared this to the expensive one , and the more expensive one is definitely not as powerful !< br /> I actually do n't use these for their intended purpose ; I use them to mix micas into vegetable oils for colorants ( for soap making ) and it can be hard with the weight of the oil . I have n't tried this one for that purpose , but I did try it to mix cream of mushroom soup with water and for as thick as it was , it was amazing how well it blended !

Love this water bottle . I 've used Sigg 's for years but never liked the fact that the top could n't be cleaned well . I was always afraid of mold growing in there . The design of this Thermos is simple and easy to clean . At least I hope in time it proves to be so . Easy to drink out of . Flip top stays in place when open and you 're drinking , just snap back to close . Can lock it with little metal flip latch . I like the metal better than the plastic . I always like to have the least amount of plastic on anything I use despite the fact they say it 's safe .

I loved this water bottle when I first bought it and raved about it to everyone in need of one . I 've had it for about 2 months , and it 's already leaking .

If you bought a Brikka before Sept 2011 , these are the gaskets for you . The old design requires TWO gaskets , one at the filter , and one around the funnel itself . So this replacement pack comes with two filter gaskets , one filter , and one funnel gasket . It appears Bialetti USA no longer stocks these parts , and you ca n't even buy them directly from them . Even their customer support does n't know about the old model ... they just throw their hands up in the air and tell you to buy a new model . Shame on you Bialetti !< br />< br /> If you bought a Brikka after Sept 2011 , then it uses standard size gaskets . You can tell if you have a new version , because it has a hole in the lid , and the water fill line is in the top half of the unit instead of in the lower pot itself . If you have a new style Brikka , then the 2-cup shares the same gasket as a standard 3-cup Moka express , and the 4-cup share the same gasket as a 6-cup Moka express. < br />< br /> However , depending on how often you use your Brikka , you could buy a new model Brikka for the cost of three of these replacement part packs ( currently selling for $ 18 / set ) . Choose wisely !< br />< br /> I rate this three stars begrudgingly , because I have an old style Brikka and feel that Bialetti shafted us early adopters by not providing continued support with replacement parts . At least they 're still available through other venues , albeit at a premium .#### #### ####[([257], [264], 'NEU'), ([104], [101], 'NEU')]
I 've tried to make almond milk a few times and found it messy , time consuming and wasteful . I was using a metal strainer because that 's what I had . We hated drinking the milk because it was gritty . I decided to buy 2 of these nut milk bags and am so glad I did ! First off , for the first 3 weeks I had them , I did n't need to make almond milk because it was on a huge discount at the store . However , I used them to sprout birdseed for my chickens and as an easy to clean strainer for rinsing off rice before cooking . Even before making milk I decided that these had been a good investment . Then I made the milk ...... WOW !! ! No gritty milk ! ! So much easier to use and clean up afterward and less waste . My dehydrator will , most likely , be able to finish drying the resulting almond meal in half the time or less than before . I use these so much , I will most likely buy one or 2 more . :-)#### #### ####[([119], [127], 'POS')]

This is my very first french press and I do n't think I could have chosen any better . I did not know what good coffee tastes like until this - now I 'm wondering why I did n't buy one sooner . The quality of the carafe , stand and press are all very good . The model that I bought even comes with an extra screen so you already have one when you wear out the first one. < br />< br /> It is easy to use , and easy to clean , and makes great coffee. < br />< br /> The only suggestion that I 'd have for SterlingPro is to figure out something different for the plastic insert under the stainless steel lid . I understand that it is there as more or less a heat shield when making and pouring coffee , and it never touches the coffee when brewing , which is important as I 've read from coffee aficionados ... If you immerse the lid / plunger assembly when cleaning , water will enter around the plastic insert and is very difficult to completely drain unless you take it apart . It is a minor gripe , especially since everything else about this press is excellent .#### #### ####[([99], [98], 'POS'), ([25], [24], 'POS')]

Plus : Keeps coffee hot for a very long time - an hour or two. < br /> Plus : Good tight seal on the top < br /> Plus : Nice rubberised base to stop slips and solid construction. < br /> Minus : No way to add milk and sugar ( ca n't stir ) once the coffee is plunged .

I did a great deal of research to have a kettle in my office and after considering , price , functionality and design this seemed like the one for me . After a month I still feel the same way .

Over the last three years I 've become a collector of sistema . These containers are great for my kids because they are so easy to open and close . No spilling the whole container trying to tug off the lid . They stack and store well , and work great after countless passes in the dishwasher . This sandwich box fits 4 cupcake liners beautifully for a bento style lunch . It 's great for more than just a sandwich !#### #### ####[([9], [16], 'POS'), ([69], [76], 'POS')]

I had high hopes for this thermometer , unfortunately it fell short . I bought it to use while grilling and love the extended handle because you can reach the meat without having to take it off the flame . The readout / display is easy to read and it is easy to use. < br />< br /> The problem I encountered was that it took a very long time to get to the correct temperature . Like 5 minutes which when grilling means an overcooked steak . I was using it to check the temperature of boneless skinless chicken breast cooked in the oven . I removed them from the oven , set the dish on the counter and inserted the probe into the thickest part of the chicken . The temp started climbing . Six minutes later , the temperature was still climbing . I know that the meat was not getting hotter 6 minutes later so I conclude that it just reads really slowly . On the hunt for a faster &# 34 ; instant &# 34 ; reading thermometer. < br />< br /> I purchased this item at retail and did not receive a discount for my honest opinions .#### #### ####[([101], [98], 'NEU'), ([41], [51], 'NEU'), ([6], [11], 'NEU')]

The first thing that hit me when I first picked up this Ice Cream Scooper was how light it felt . My old scooper that I lost in a move had the same shape and size but was much heavier , I much prefer the lighter feel and the shiny stainless steel look of this one since it my nephew is able to use this one while my old one he could barely hold ( it was that heavy !) and control . As for the performance of the ice cream scoop , it works as it expected though the instructions say to run the scoop through some warm water to let the scoop heat up and really cut into ice cream a lot easier , and I tried it once and it worked very well especially if you keep your freezer at a very low temperature which makes for very hard ice cream . Overall this scoop performs as it should , it looks sleek and feel very light. < br />< br /> Please note I received this item for my honest and unbiased review .#### #### ####[([153], [151], 'POS'), ([109], [108], 'POS')]

We love this blender and the quality complaints are not accurate , do n't overfill the blender , put some liquid or soft items in .

I think the concept is good , but the filter bottle did not fit my cooler so I had to remove the plastic ring . I filled the filter with water and came back a few hours later to find my floor flooded with water . Apparently the plastic switch on the bottom is supposed to cut off the water flow once the cooler is full but it did n't . As a result the cooler overflowed and now I have a mess to clean up . My cooler has worked like a charm for 6 months with other bottles of water so I 'm returning the filter bottle .#### #### ####[([101], [98], 'NEG'), ([15], [5], 'NEG'), ([30], [35], 'NEG'), ([36], [35], 'NEG'), ([88], [98], 'NEG')]

Great product , have been using it for over 3 years now and still works & looks as good as when we bought it ! The only maintenance required to keep it looking great is a wipe down with a damp cloth on the outside and a rinse with diluted white vinegar to remove mineral deposit ' stains' on the inside base of the kettle - a few times a year. .< br />< br /> Do read the ' most helpful ' reviews that cover the pros / cons , I agree with them all but I personally do n't find the con 's worth removing 1 of the 5 stars. < br />< br /> One comment regarding the ( ridiculous ) 1L minimum fill : I have simply ignored this guideline since day # 1 and I just boil the amount of water I need , sometimes as little as 1 cup worth . Never had any issues with it , the kettle will stop when the water is boiling as long as the lid is shut .#### #### ####[([103], [105], 'POS')]

I currently own a Keurig Platinum as my house , and I love it , this Keurig 2.0 I purchased for my office and I equally love it . Now thankfully the entire office is n't using it as the water reservoir is n't very large . However that being said it is perfect for a single person . The option to brew full coffee pots is a nice feature however I doubt i will ever use it . It brews quietly ( a lot more quiet than my platinum ) . The limiting of the K-Cups to Keurig brand is n't that huge of a deal however if you do your homework there is multiple ways around this .

Excellent water bottle , water stays cold and no condensation . I have left it outside over night and through most of the day and still had ice cold water in the summer . Only cons are the straw sometimes comes detached inside and you have to open it to put it back in place and you can only put 1 sometimes 2 ice cubes in at a time so it 's not really easy to fill w an auto ice maker on the front of your fridge .

Looks great , works great ! Wish it held slightly more water but that has nothing to do with this kettle . It says 2-quart whistling teakettle . I got the turquoise blue-ish color and love it . Very true to the photo color and seems high quality . The whistle is n't too obnoxious or ear piercing , just loud enough to hear in the next room while watching tv . The whistle also starts out really quiet actually before gradually getting to full volume , which I like because if you are in the kitchen when it whistles it 's nice and quiet and you can walk over and take it off , whereas like I said if I am in the next few rooms over I will still be able to hear it . The sound it makes I would compare to like a recorder type whistle . After it begins to whistle if you leave it on as the steam continues to build up the whistle gets louder and it does get very loud within about 1 min , so for anyone worrying about missing it , you wo n't . And for people not wanting it loud , it does n't start out whistling at full volume so it is perfect all around !#### #### ####[([11], [1], 'POS'), ([43], [39], 'POS'), ([47], [39], 'POS'), ([70], [60], 'POS')]

I had previously heard of whiskey stones before , but I always associated them with only whiskey . I do n't drink whiskey so I never picked any up . I saw some reviewers mention using these for other drinks and then I realized how handy these could be . I drink coffee every morning , but it comes out of my Keurig a bit too hot for me , so I put an ice cube in it . I hate how the ice dilutes my coffee , but I just dealt with it . These have solved that problem . Two of them get my coffee to the perfect temp in a couple minutes ! We have used them in soda and juices and they are great. < br />< br /> I should note that these do n't work as good as ice cubes . The description sates that &# 34 ; Will not Get the Drink as Cold as Ice &# 34 ; , so that 's not a surprise . They help maintain the temp of already cold drinks , they cool room temp drinks a bit and they slightly cool hot drinks . Using more cools the drink more. < br />< br /> Not only are the amazing for cooling drinks , but they make a fun little &# 34 ; clink &# 34 ; noise in the glass . They are moderately heavy , so be careful not to let them slam against your teeth . They also look really cool in clear glasses . The case they come in is really nice and the tongs are a great little extra . These are a wonderful gift idea . All my friends know that when I go to restaurants and get my rare Diet Coke , I always get it without ice because I HATE it being watered down . This would be the perfect gift for someone like me . I highly recommend this set because it works good and looks really cool ! I was sent this to test and review . That has no bearing on my rating or review of it , this is my honest opinion .#### #### ####[([145], [142], 'POS'), ([272], [275], 'POS'), ([283], [276], 'POS'), ([113], [109], 'POS'), ([196], [199], 'POS')]

My grilling routine was missing something , but I did n't know what that might be ... until I received this basting brush and cup . Up until now I 've only used that basting tool that looks like a mini mop . You know the one I mean . It soaks up a lot of sauce or marinade or whatever , and you can really slather all over the meat on the grill with it , but cleaning it is a nightmare . I 've never really trusted that it was completely clean , and not still harboring germs and bacteria and such . Well , after trying this new stainless steel basting brush , I can finally throw away that old &# 34 ; mop &# 34 ; baster !< br />< br /> This basting brush has a nice long handle for reaching deep into the grill if necessary . Silicone bristles means it will pick up and hold a good deal of whatever you 're basting with , but also makes clean-up a breeze . I love the little folding basting cup which is made of silicone too . Silicone is so easy to use , heat resistant , and cleans up fast , so you could move from barbeque sauce to melted butter simply by swishing both cup and brush in hot sudsy water , rinsing well , and letting air dry . Simple as that . The handy storage bag that 's included means you can keep the brush and cup together when not in use . I will probably keep this with my grilling tools , but the brush and cup would be useful in the kitchen too . I like to brush melted butter on the tops of my biscuits , and that would be easy to do with this set . The silicone cup wo n't transfer heat from whatever 's inside it , making it ideal for basting with hot or warm liquids . And the cup is collapsible , which means it does n't take up unnecessary room. < br />< br /> A great grilling set and useful in the kitchen too . Would also make a great gift !#### #### ####[([137], [142], 'POS'), ([244], [238], 'POS'), ([222], [227], 'POS')]

Unfortunately I came across this as a loose tea device , and I can honestly say that this makes about as good a tea bottle as it does a fruit infuser.As others noted , the infuser barrel is tiny -- 2 3 / 4 &# 34 ; ( height ) x 1 1 / 2 &# 34 ; ( diameter )-- so the amount of time you would need to spend to dice the fruit far outweighs any benefit of &# 34 ; infusing &# 34 ; the water. < br />< br /> As for use as a tea maker - well , the reality is , all it makes is a bitter , caustic brew . Tea leaves are n't meant to steep indefinitely , but by the time you can actually drink it ( yes , it does a GREAT job of keeping liquids warm !) , even the lightest teas are dark and acidic . Sure , you could take the strainer out - but that sort of defeats the purpose ; I already HAVE multi piece tea setups. < br />< br /> All in all , this ended up being a $ 10 insulated beverage holder - and I already had plenty of those .#### #### ####[([153], [152], 'NEG'), ([118], [113], 'NEG'), ([48], [38], 'NEG')]

We had a big party with lots of guests but not enough room to chill all the white wine . I tried this out and it works great . You freeze it and then when you ’re going to drink , you stick it in the wine bottle and you get chilled wine . I was nervous about using it another chill stick had scary reviews about the stick breaking in the bottle and the cooling liquid getting into the wine . This is a smart design since the rod is stainless steel ( less likely to break ) and the cooling liquid is non-toxic , which is comforting . I like the rubber stopper to keep the rod in place . WARNING : you must pour some wine out or it will overflow . The spout and aerator are nice touches . Packaging was good and I appreciated the cutter as well . Great to bring to parties !< br />* Honest review for discounted product *#### #### ####[([52], [56], 'POS'), ([92], [85], 'POS'), ([62], [64], 'POS'), ([92], [95], 'POS')]

I would have to say this is a must . I love wine and as do most of my friends . We usually have one or two bottles that still have some left . Now , I do n't have to worry about it going flat fast . Easy to use too . If you hear your box rattling , like I did , do n't worry . The pump fell out of the cut out for it .

Benefit / price ratio of this item is incredible . Considering a loaf of good bread costs around 5 $ , it can bake the same thing for nearly 1 / 4th of its price , saving almost 3.75 $ a day .

I am switching from steel knives to ceramic in my camping kit , and decided on this paring knife. < br /> The rubberized handle makes it easy to wash , capable of soaking , and the ceramic blade keeps it constantly sharp , impervious to rust and light weight . This knife comes with a little blade cover that fits extremely snug - no accidental falling off on this one. < br />< br /> The paring knife cuts well . It 's definitely sharper than cheaper steel knives , but is missing that ' extreme ' edge compared to higher quality steel knives . That said , it 's lightweight , compact and does not require sharpening . It 's been used to cut fruit , carve hotdogs , spear food and do light-weight cutting chores around camp . Stays sharp . We dropped it once while the blade cover was on onto some rocks by accident , and the knife suffered no damage . While they say not to handle dropped ceramic knives , I have n't had any issues using it since then . YMMV . ( Dropped ceramic knives can have structurally compromised integrity , meaning the knife could shatter during the next use , so be careful !)< br />< br /> Compared to a ceramic santoku I own , the knive really is much duller , and the sharpening shows that the knife was sharpened in segments , not in one go . So I imagine the sharpened edge is not uniformly sharp . For this I 've removed a star , but as a simple , no frills and easy to clean paring knife with decent durability , it 's a solid cutter and a good introduction into showing the potential of ceramic knives . Had I not already had a santoku of extremely good quality , I would likely have rated this five stars. < br />< br /> I was given a discount for this item in exchange for an unbiased review .#### #### ####[([175], [174], 'POS'), ([52], [56], 'POS'), ([89], [87], 'POS'), ([46], [42], 'POS'), ([89], [85], 'POS')]

I originally purchased the 12 oz at Walmart and fell in love with it . So I purchase this on Amazon for my water . I tested it and boy did it pass the test . I filled is up at 7 am with water and ice . I took it with me on the road and left it in the car for 4 hours in the blazing heat of 100 degrees . So by 5 pm It was very hot to the touch so my husband put in the back seat thinking the water was going to be too hot to drink . Wrong ! ! Not only was it cold but still had the ice. < br /> Again the next week , I filled it up with my ice tea I purchased at a drive thru Saturday late afternoon and the next morning it was still cold and still had ice. < br /> The best thing of all is that it does not spill . Another test , my bag it was in fell while making a turn and everything in my bag went rolling on the floor . Not a drop fell out . Wow , this is the most awesome bottle ever . I will say that I do agree about the sipping . You do have difficulties getting the last drops but this is minor . Be sure that it is this style of Bubba as the plastic Bubba 's leak even though they say spill proof , they are not . I found that the Hero series is the only one that do not leak .#### #### ####[([223], [226], 'POS')]

I use a lot of wine in my cooking so this is the perfect gadget for me . I have tried the regular cork screws and they just do n't cut it .

These work as expected . They are very small , which is great for fitting then into small herb lgrinders , but the handles are so short and small that it makes it harder for me to hold them without dropping them .

I am generally VERY easy going when it comes to products , any products . If it mostly works , I am okay with it . My standards are not high. < br />< br /> However , this fellow stopped heating up at all after just one use ( yes , one . ) The second time , I plugged it in -- no light comes on . Switch outlets , try again , same results . Sucker would n't heat. < br />< br /> Look , it does n't have to be perfect ! Other people may complain about the weird smell , the impossibility to clean it , the uneven heating . To be honest I barely noticed these flaws . But I do expect my devices to at least , you know , actually turn on . That would be swell . I called Amazon 's CS and wept a bit and they were marvelous and sent me a return label , even though I was outside my 30 day window. < br />< br /> I 'll probably get a stovetop iron next ... at least then I do n't have to worry about it not heating ?#### #### ####[([123], [113], 'NEG'), ([149], [159], 'NEG'), ([155], [159], 'NEG')]

This is one of my favorite Amazon purchases . I replaced the plastic spigot on a ceramic urn with this bad boy . The flow from the original plastic spigot was pathetic , and it felt like my life was passing me by every time I filled up just a glass of water . And if you did n't hold the glass right up to the spigot , the flow would n't completely make it into the glass . This stainless steel faucet looks nice , and has a great solid feel . The valve operation is silky smooth . The water flow is perfect and a true thing of beauty . The flow does n't really deviate even two feet downstream . I am actually drinking more water just because I get a kick out of using this . It is a real timesaver ! But I still wish that it was made in the good ol ' USA .

The WORST . We purchased the Summit 30 &# 34 ; unit in December of 2013 . We also purchased an additional warranty on the item .

We called and were told the stainless were on backorder . We received the stainless shelves a few months later . Then it stopped cooling . The warranty company sent someone out to look at it and discovered the compressor was bad . We needed another one . That was 9 months ago . My husband calls almost monthly about it . Guess what ? ! The compressor is on BACKORDER ! Still . I 'm with the other purchaser that it 's a huge inconveniences because we built our new cabinets to specifically fit this 30 &# 34 ; item .

highly entertaining ! I 'm making Popsicle every time I ca n't finish something I 'm drinking now . I have n't started making custom recipes , but juices and creams work pretty fine . I 've had some learning curves following up with some of my cream based pops , which when over frozen , were hard to pull out . And if you fudge-around with the stick before they 're fully set , there may also be difficulties taking the pop out . Just remember to let them set fully before taking them out , and make sure the sticks are fully inserted before they freeze . I 've had to defrost the unit a few times for my blunders. < br />< br /> I took a star down for it since the production quality is not seamless . There are parts of the plastic casing that are not matched exactly . Though the sticks , the tools , and the actual freezing mechanism seem pretty solid . Also , the two pop maker only had the one color and I would have liked another .

In the past I have owned a $ 200 toaster and a $ 10 toaster . The cheap toaster produced similar results to the expensive toaster , so I assumed this Cuisinart toaster would be much the same as the other two , I was wrong . This is very , very flimsy . Whenever I push the lever down the whole toaster tips ! I have to literally hold the toaster down with my other hand every time I push the lever down . The lever also gets stuck , so you may think something is toasting but no , the lever 's just gotten stuck again . Probably the most annoying thing though , is that as a toaster , you 'd expect it to produce decent toast . Not gonna happen with this little Betty . Every single time , one side of my toast will be black and the other will be barely cooked - adjustments to the dial do n't seem to make any difference . This machine has become the running joke in our kitchen . Looking forward to when it breaks ( which I 'm sure wo n't be long ) so that we can replace it. < br />< br /> I have given it one star solely for it 's appearance . It looks good , from a distance , for the price .#### #### ####[([120], [128], 'NEG'), ([14], [20], 'NEG')]
This is my new favorite wine aerator . I have several aerators that plug into the wine bottle , so you can pour directly into a glass , but they always drip all over the counter . And sometimes I want to use a decanter and let the wine breathe a little longer before pouring a glass. < br />< br /> The Tanors Wine Decanter Aerator does a great job aerating wine , and it fits perfectly in both of my wine decanters . I can just set it on the top of the decanter and pour an entire bottle , or as much as I want to decant . When I 'm done , I just set it in the provided stand to prevent getting wine on the counter top. < br />< br /> You ca n't beat the price , either . The aerator comes in nice packaging with a stand and travel bag ... it would make a great gift for any wine enthusiast. < br />< br /> Overall , I 'm really impressed with the Tanors Wine Decanter Aerator .

I love magnets very much especially with their high durability and wide range of use . I think everyone needs this magnet , it is very useful . For me , I 'm happy that I 'll no longer hear the usual question : dishes in the dishwasher are clean or not ? . It is made of high quality magnet that stays very well on the dishwasher and can be flipped very easily . I like the glossy coat which makes it more water resistant and gives it a nicer look . Its size is really appropriate and perfect for its function .

We bought this to peel apples to put in our freezer . It works great . Yes it does n't peel at the top or bottom but it only takes one cut each end to get rid of the peeling there .

Ever since getting this colander , that 's all we ever use ! It 's awesome that it collapses down to fit easily in the cupboard without taking up a ton of space like a regular colander would . Being able to hang it on the sink is also great because you never have to worry about any draining fluid backing up , it stays clear of the bottom of the sink .

The press is pretty good . However,somehow the right and left sides of the inner insert bent inwards while I was pressing garlic which meant the insert slipped down through the outer casing . It was hard to get out and I had to bend the tabs outwards again .

Do you have a biter in your house ? You know , about 3.5 foot tall , 3-5 years old that always bites your reusable straws rendering them useless ? Well , then these are the straws for you ! ! I have finally found a straw my kids cannot destroy ! Sweet ! Lol , can you tell how excited I am ? ! These straws are not only indestructible , being made of stainless steel , but they 're also incredibly easy to clean and even come with a pipe cleaner to make that job even simpler . An unexpected surprise with these is the fact that the metal straw holds the cold temp of my beverage , keeping it cold on its journey to my taste buds . These are child friendly , all one piece so no choking hazards unless your child is training to be a sword swallow-er - in which case these could possibly be deemed a choking hazard , lol .

So , these salt and pepper grinders certainly do look nice , and they do grind as claimed . My only real issue with them is that they only work well when using them as COARSE grind , not FINE grind . If you turn one direction , hardly anything at all comes out , even if you adjust the knob where the grains come out . Coarse however works great , and really is just what you would expect normal grinded spices to be sized as . So if you are fine with it having one setting for grain size , then these work and look great !< br />< br /> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review .#### #### ####[([5], [10], 'POS'), ([6], [10], 'POS')]

I 'm in love with this machine . I 'm a first time Keurig user and I cannot get enough of this Keurig 2.0 K350 brewer . I honestly do not understand the negative buzz around the 2.0 machines . I 've read various complaints mostly specifically about having to use pods specifically approved by Keurig for the machine to work , however , from a financial perspective , it is saving me money . With $ 12 I can purchase a pack of 16 K-cups , which is equivalent to about 75 cents per 8oz cup of coffee , meanwhile a 12oz bag of the same brand of ground coffee will be about $ 10 and I 'll get 72 oz out of it which is about 90 cents per 8oz cup of coffee . Not a huge difference but just reiterating that I do n't understand the complaints . Furthermore , it is super convenient popping in a K-cup and hitting a button to brew my perfect cup ! It is attractive to look at , easy to clean and overall a great machine to invest in . I 've had it for about a month now and do n't have one single complaint ! Thanks , Keurig , for the free pods for this review !#### #### ####[([169], [173], 'POS'), ([25], [19], 'POS'), ([34], [33], 'POS'), ([139], [138], 'POS')]
I became acquainted with these machines in Europe and decided I could n't live without a small short or two of excellent coffee when I returned to the states . Nespresso does what it claims to do !< br />< br /> We actually make coffee in a standard pot in the morning , but later in the day , this serves up exactly what we need . BE CAREFUL , however . Most of its pods are for tiny espresso , and only 6 out of the entire group are for double the amount ( just under a cup ) . Check Amazon for a very long review which tells you everything you want to know . You can also call the company for personalized training ( you will probably need it in order to turn the machine on and select the right size ) . The people you will talk to make sure you understand and encourage you to call back if you do n't .#### #### ####[([108], [107], 'POS'), ([148], [143], 'POS'), ([7], [16], 'POS'), ([89], [88], 'POS'), ([22], [16], 'POS')]
if you enjoy cooking you have to have a cast iron in your kitchen . I was worried about using this and how to season it , but reading some articles and trying it a few times it really was n't that difficult . Here are the steps to season your cast iron :< br />< br />- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees < br />- Only during the first time wash it with soap and water using a sponge < br />- Rinse < br />- Rub vegetable oil inside and out using a towel < br />- Place in the oven for an hour < br />- Turn off the oven and leave in there until it 's cooled completely < br />< br /> After it 's seasoned the pot should only be washed with water and non-metal brush. < br />< br /> The benefits of cooking using this cast iron pot are tremendous since the pot transfers the heat evenly also you use less oil in your cooking because of the seasoning of the pot . Cooking in cast iron also increases iron in your food , which has great health benefits. < br />< br /> I use this pot in cooking in the over or over the grill as well as stove . There are a number of dishes that I 've made in this pot and I can generally say that the food comes out better tasting and love the flexibility of this pot. < br />< br /> There are some other more expensive brands out there , but I like the quality of this pot and I prefer to buy American made items .#### #### ####[([188], [195], 'POS'), ([36], [42], 'POS'), ([63], [70], 'POS'), ([170], [169], 'POS'), ([156], [158], 'POS')]

I thought this would be a great filter for our city water , it boasts removing many common contaminates . Which would be great IF YOU COULD GET IT WORKING !! ! Just trying to disassemble this product to wash the first time around was awful . The plastic parts clip so tight you wonder if you are breaking into fort Knox . Trying to get the water spout hook up to work with any common sink required disassembling the sink arm !!! ! ARE YOU KIDDING ME ? Unfortunately I thought this was a slam dunk and threw away the original box and insert and kept the instruction book which was almost useless . After 30 minutes I marched out to our garbage and chucked it . So much for the 27 bucks . Save your money this is a garbage product .#### #### ####[([50], [41], 'NEG'), ([18], [23], 'NEG'), ([11], [17], 'NEG')]

This blender is awesome ! The big thing to note is that you get what you pay for . I bought the 400 HP and it does what I expected it to do ... Chop fruits and veggies into a rather consistent smoothie . Occasionally there are a few chunks , but for a 30 $ blender do you really expect the same quality as a 600 $ blender ? I will be happy if this lasts a year and if / when it dies I will buy it again . I have been using it every morning for 2 weeks with no issues and it works perfect for me .#### #### ####[([63], [62], 'POS'), ([42], [41], 'POS')]

I bought this product for the price and its multiple functions . However , my experience with the product led me to believe that it is a mere 2-star product . When I first took it out of the box , I was happy to notice that the grey lining was a soft touch material which allowed me to have a much more sturdy and nice grip . What upset me , by quite a lot , was its poor construction and unacceptable finishing touches . The glue holding this grey lining extended out-and-beyond and onto the handle itself . I had to spend a good amount of time finding the right material to wash this sticky residue off the handle ( remember that was the first time I had taken it out of the box ) . Thus , first star off . After its first clean up , I proceeded to finally using the damned thing . Oh my goodness it is WEAK ! Weak . Weak . Weak . I put on the mixer attachment and stuck it into my bowl and turn it on . BARELY ANY MOVEMENT . So I decided to move it around a bit , left and right , back and forth , round and round ... still BARELY ANY MOVEMENT . I then raised my hand slightly up and WOOOSH !! ! the mixer splats my ingredients . Hmmm . Not too impressed . Thus , second star off . Lastly , the battery simply sucks . I do not know what it is about this product , but apparently even when you charge this thing for an hour , then overnight , and then some , and then some more , it still refuses to last more than merely a few minutes . Thus , third star off . I believe that there is a lot of potential in this product , but without strength and energy it is still just a step above useless .#### #### ####[([127], [126], 'NEG'), ([120], [111], 'NEG'), ([83], [82], 'NEG')]

I am very happy with the Elekcity 11lb scale ! . I have got a few products from the elekcity company and I have been happy with everyone ! I recently purchased a scale from a retail store and well it was complete junk . First thing I noticed about this one was that it was better built and had a very stylish design and it looks like it is built to last ! This does a very nice job at weighing whatever you are putting on it . I can not tell you yet if the batteries would last a while or they would go quick since I have been using this for only about a week now but my opinion after a week and they are still coming on then its not wasting them somehow =^) . Overall my opinion on this is it will be a great scale for years and it is as good as the high priced ones out there !#### #### ####[([16], [15], 'POS'), ([150], [149], 'POS')]

This thing makes life so much easier . My kids and husband always puts things that splatter in the microwave without putting a paper towel over top of it and it drives me crazy because when it splatters all over the microwave it 's disgusting and gross and I end up cleaning it multiple times a day , especially during the summer when my children are home from school . Is microwave plate cover fits pretty much bowl and plate I own . I leave it in the microwave so when they play something in there they know to place it right on top because if I left it out put if sight out if kind , since I leave it in the microwave it reminds them to use it . This also helps to hold moisture contain so your food does n't dry out as badly with when you do n't use it . It 's extremely easy to clean With a little mild soap and water .

I love the idea of this but this thing is dangerous and more hassle then it 's worth .

In my county we HAVE to bring our own bags with us or pay $. 05 for each paper bag we get from the grocery store .

There are many things I like about this saucepan . The size is perfect for making tea for 4 , soups , and sauces . Cleanup is easy . It comes out shiny out of the dishwasher . But there are also a few things that are super annoying . First , as one reviewer said , it tends to tip over towards the handle when empty . When you pour something in it , then it stabilizes . This is a minor inconvenience and once you know this , you can work around the limitation . Second , if you keep the lid on when heating ( as I often do ) , the lid handle gets phenomenally hot ! I have many stainless pots with lids , and steel being a poor conductor of heat , the lid handles do get warm , but not burning hot like this ! And although I 've learned to use potholders and towels when lifting the lid , my guests have often been burned . This is the one reason why I would n't recommend this pot to anyone. < br /> UPDATE 11 / 21 / 15 :< br /> After having used this saucepan for many months now , the lid getting hot has become a real deal breaker for me . I have Fisler pots too , and their lids are cool to the touch .#### #### ####[([211], [213], 'NEG'), ([207], [213], 'NEG'), ([130], [133], 'NEG'), ([231], [233], 'NEG')]

About the right size to put on an English muffin after cooked which makes for a nice sandwich but the trial and error to try to get the eggs cooked was a negative for me . I have a 700 watt microwave , followed the instructions to add 1 tsp of water after I added the egg to the compartment and then cook on 50 % power for 1 minute . The result was a mostly still raw egg white . I still have n't perfected a time / power combination that results in a cooked white and set yolk . Inexpensive enough that I 'll keep using but really would prefer clear directions and timing .#### #### ####[([89], [79], 'NEU')]

UPDATE : I have been using these now to cover up garden produce on the counter , and as others have written but I did n't believe , they really do keep the fruit flies off the food ! These covers hit the trifecta for great product : inexpensive , easy to use , and effective. < br />< br /> I just received these so have n't had much experience with them yet , but they look like they 'll keep everything but fruit flies off the food . ( Nothing but a sealed container or refrigeration keeps out fruit flies , so if that 's the reason you 're thinking of buying these food covers , abandon hope and put out a vinegar trap . ) I like the ease with which they open and close -- an elastic band just slips off and on the rim of the collapsed cover .

I searched and searched for a French Press and I almost bought a glass one because of the lower price and the pretty designs , but I was worried about breaking the beaker . When this Secura Stainless Steel French Press popped up on the lightning deals I was tickled pink !

The lid fits great , no slipping when I turn it up to get the last drop of silky coffee out , and I have yet to find even the tiniest coffee ground in my cup . If I had a negative it would only be that stainless steel shows fingerprints and smudges like nobody 's business , but that would just be nit-picky .

We love fondue in our house and had been using a smaller crockpot to do the job . It never seemed to get hot enough and took forever to actually melt the cheese to be ready . We also wanted to branch out and try oil fondue as well . I looked around and read reviews and decided on this fondue pot . We tried it out last night with a cheddar / gouda cheese fondue . It was awesome to say the least . Heated things up 3x faster than the crockpot . Was ready in a matter of minutes instead of 45 minutes . Was easy to clean < br />< br /> The little bowls are pretty small . Ca n't really put too much in them . They might be good for sauces etc . We did n't end up using ours . Also , the pot itself does n't come off of the legs so it take up a lot of room for storage .#### #### ####[([32], [23], 'POS'), ([73], [79], 'POS'), ([32], [35], 'POS'), ([117], [120], 'POS'), ([16], [23], 'POS')]

The inner slots do n't brown to the same level of &# 34 ; doneness &# 34 ; as the companion outer slots , so you ca n't efficiently toast four pieces at the same time .

this bag is a heavier weight and finer strain . Plus it is larger and I did n't worry about spilling the nut milk while pouring it into the bag . It was also much easier to squeeze and strain . This is the best quality nut milk bag I 've used ! Very sturdy and I can tell that it will really last . Love the recipes that come with it .

These steamers are the only ones that can be used to reheat a grilled steak without drying it out . Start with just a few seconds and repeat if necessary . I like to take the chill off and it is as good as freshly grilled - even after refrigerating overnight . Fresh vegetables can be made crisp or very soft but the flavor is always very fresh . I bought my first ones about 9 years ago at a grocery store - deeply discounted - took it home to try it and rushed back to buy them for friends and family . I did n't know what a bargain they were . If I had I would have cleared out their stock . I continue to look for good prices on these . I just purchased this for my adult granddaughter who has little time to cook - refreshing leftovers is great for her busy life . And she is cooking fresh vegetables in seconds . As suggested , I do n't put them in the dishwasher and they 're still just like new .#### #### ####[([145], [155], 'POS'), ([63], [72], 'POS'), ([36], [42], 'POS'), ([25], [24], 'POS')]

We use a lot of Himalayan salt , and on the dining table I had a small crock and spoon. < br /> When entertaining , some people would be shy about using it , and one time ( eeeek ! ) A guest licked his fingertip and touched the salt to get a taste. < br /> Into the trash it went . Stuff like that gives me the heebie-jeebies. < br /> Never will it be an issue again with this handsome set. < br />< br /> Peppercorns and salt are neat and sanitary in these grinder mills . Easy to fill and use. < br /> Really adds a special touch when dining. < br />< br /> Product received to test with the option to review .

My job requires extended hotel stays and this oven ( in addition to an induction burner ) has meant that I am able to keep my usual eating habits while living in a hotel room . I wasted no time testing this mighty little oven out - immediately after setting up the oven I roasted a 3lb rack of BBQ ribs to perfection . After cutting a pizza stone to fit the rack ( you can also buy a specially sized Breville pizza stone accessory as well ) I have baked several thin crust pizzas as well as baked pies , cookies , cakes and brownies . Of course it can also be used to toast. < br />< br /> Surprisingly the baking times are a little bit longer than a conventional oven , even with the optional convection setting turned on . However , I have had no problem simply adding time and watching closely. < br />< br /> If you are measuring for a spot do keep in mind that the metal exterior gets very hot . I try to only keep small ceramic / glass items on top if I have to set things there ( it is perfect for keeping a glass / metal / ceramic dish warm . It is recommended that there should be 4in of open space on either side of the oven where vents are located .#### #### ####[([133], [132], 'POS'), ([33], [26], 'POS'), ([101], [92], 'POS')]

My family has always used roatery graters and after trying straight graters for my college years , I finally decided to buy a big-girl rotary .

I have some mixed feelings about this Tiger Corp . Stainless Steel Travel Mug . I like its sleek , simple style , and the fact that the bottom of it is narrow enough to fit in the cup holders in all my vehicles . When the button is not pressed down , it does n't leak at all. < br />< br /> It works really well to keep drinks both hot and cold for a long time . I had hot coffee 3 hours after I filled it , though no longer burning hot , it was definitely still hot , not warm . When I used it for iced tea and ice water , I was able to refill it twice with the same set of ice. < br />< br /> However , I wish the lid were made a little differently . You can not see inside it for cleaning . You can click the button down and shake it around in the soapy hot water , and then run hot water through it , but you ca n't scrub inside it . I have to double-check that I have it facing the right direction before drinking since the edge is the same all the way around . There is n't a raised side that lets me easily drink without looking . Found that out the hard way with hot coffee. < br />< br /> And I confess I 've gotten used to a different style that self-locks between sips . I left it sitting on the counter with the button pushed down , and it got knocked over and spilled coffee all over my lesson plan . Oops !< br />< br /> Do not fill above the inner line . If you do , and then try to put the lid on , it will leak out around the seal . Also , if you do that it creates a vacuum seal inside sometimes that means you need to remove the lid and screw it on again to let you get a sip . Again , just a lesson learned the hard way. < br />< br /> I do like it but I think I 'll use it primarily for cold drinks rather than coffee . I 've just had a few too many issues with using it for coffee .#### #### ####[([28], [32], 'POS'), ([176], [169], 'POS'), ([160], [168], 'POS'), ([170], [169], 'POS'), ([296], [295], 'POS')]

This is the perfect kitchen paring knife short of products that are three or four times as expensive .

It 's very sharp right out of the cool box it comes in . Add the included sharpener and there is nothing to dislike about this knife. < br />< br /> I have many $ 50 knives in my collection , all widths and lengths . Now I 'm not stupid and buy lots of knives , each one I own is extremely sharp and span a very wide time frame . Many are quite old and from different makers while some are new and from a single maker. < br />< br /> In conclusion ; I have ordinary steel knives that are sharper , but none that hold this edge as long . Sort of . Acidic foods are bad for this blade unless you are seriously cleaning while cutting . It 's delicate in a good way .#### #### ####[([70], [69], 'POS')]

I love silicone mats for both rolling out dough and for baking , and this BakeitFun mat is a great addition to my kitchen because it 's not quite like my others . It has measurements in both inches and centimeters on the edges so assist when you need to roll out dough to exact dimensions , and it has 11 printed concentric circle for piping out matching sizes of whoopee pies , macarons , meringues , or cookies . Like many but not all silicone mats , it is reinforced inside using a fiberglass mesh that also helps with even heat distribution . I encountered only two heat-scratching features of this baking mat : 1 . The manufacturer decided to place the BakeitFun logo in such a position that there 's no 12th circle , a real pain when you 're trying to make macarons or sandwich cookies . 2. The instructions say to wash in warm soapy water before first use and to coat in vegetable oil . It says that you do n't have to repeat the oil unless you wash it in the dishwasher . I 've never heard of oiling a silicone mat before , but I did go along with the instructions. < br />< br /> One of the possible downsides to cooking on silicone is that some prevent bottom browning . This one does not . In fact , the bottoms of my baked goods come out with evenly browned undersides. < br />< br /> The size is perfect for fitting inside a standard cookie sheet / jelly roll pan . It 's called a &# 34 ; half sheet &# 34 ; because it 's approximately the size of a half sheet cake. < br />< br /> I really love this baking mat for the measurements as well as the standard positive attributes of a silicone mat . I only wish the designer had taken into account a baker 's need to have an even number of circles . Note : I received a free sample for testing and review. < br />< br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann#### #### ####[([52], [62], 'POS'), ([123], [133], 'POS')]

Overall like the product . Easy to use and goes quickly for most items I 've tried . It can be awkward if you do n't have it suctioned though , as it 's not heavy enough to work well free-standing . I 've owned it 16 months and noticed some rust the other week in the handle . I put mine in the dishwasher , never thought anything of it before now ; I was just about to put it in for another wash and saw there is rust on the bottom . 4 screws hold on the blade slot and those are rusted pretty badly . There are also screws on the suction cups , but those are rust free .#### #### ####[([47], [53], 'POS'), ([68], [77], 'POS'), ([51], [53], 'POS'), ([3], [12], 'POS')]

I enjoy cooking and love to have high-quality and reliable kitchen utensils . Well , this is definitely an excellent high-quality set of food tongs . They are nice and long at 9.6 &# 34 ; and are made of stainless steel for easy cleaning and removal of bacteria . I found that they are easy to hold and manage , and the locking mechanism works fine every time . I can think of so many uses for these tongs such as ice dispenser , mixing and serving salads and spaghetti , meats , chicken , bacon , home fries well - you get the idea . The tongs pinch well and secure so that I do n't drop my foods . They are also very easy to store . I purchased this set of food tongs at a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review , and the thoughts in this review are my own .#### #### ####[([21], [19], 'POS'), ([10], [19], 'POS'), ([82], [75], 'POS')]

These little scrappers are fantastic for scrapping out my herb and spice grinder which I use quite frequently because I love fresh herbs and spices when I 'm cooking , so it gets rather caked up depending on the spefific ingredients I may be using , these take care of it very simply and quickly ! The little longer ends gets in the edges better than I expected wich is a huge bonus ! It seems hard to break these as well which is a good thing for me I can break most things ! But have n't broke a single one yet !

I do n't use a microwave and I do n't like hot air popcorn . This is the closest thing to what we used when I was a child , though that one was electric and gave us a shock more than a few times. < br />< br /> I make popcorn with it by putting oil and salt in the popper , then the popcorn , fit on the lid , then wait for the first pop . Then , crank the handle til the popping stops , turn off the gas , and it 's done. < br />< br /> Only flaw in it is that the wooden end of the handle has a deep crack in it , so I 'm not sure how long it 's going to last . That 's a quality control problem and does n't affect function , until it breaks off , and then I 'll have a problem to figure out what to use there , instead. < br />< br /> It washes up pretty well and if you do n't mind that its parts are a little cumbersome , I 'd recommend it to anybody . I would buy it again . But it looks like it will last a long time .#### #### ####[([198], [190], 'POS'), ([12], [18], 'POS'), ([13], [11], 'POS'), ([28], [18], 'POS'), ([39], [43], 'POS')]

Love these reusable straws . I use them for ice coffee or smoothies . They are really easy to clean - I do n't even use the included cleaning brush . The trick is not to let them sit out and dry after use with a thick smoothie . I just flush them with hot water immediately after use and put them in the dishwasher with everything else . The straws I received are exactly 8.5 &# 34 ; long with a 1 / 4 &# 34 ; diameter . I 've been using them semi-regularly for nearly a year now and they show no signs of rust or wear . This is likely due to their composition - the 18 / 10 stainless steel means they are made up of 18 % chromium and 10 % nickel , making them more resistant to corrosion . UPDATE I am still using these straws and there are absolutely zero signs of rust or corrosion . I am very impressed with them . I use them nearly daily with my morning iced coffee . Yes , even in winter , something about iced coffee that keeps me going . To this day I still have n't used the included cleaning brush . Never had the need . A quick rinse with hot soapy water and into the drying rack ! Sometimes I throw them in the dishwasher if I 'm planning to run a load but there really is n't a need for that either .#### #### ####[([213], [220], 'POS'), ([152], [142], 'POS')]

The coravin 1000 wine system is a revolutionary new gadget for wine lovers . Basically it 's an insulation system that allows you to access the wine without actually opening the bottle . The device injects argon into the bottle once it 's opened , pressurizing the contents and thus keeping it from mixing with O2 . Upon removal of the device , the cork is resealed ( im not sure how ) but it worked with the three bottles I tried it with. < br />< br /> It 's a little awkward the first time you try it but it 's really easy after one use . Keep in mind that the wine pours through the system so you will be essentially pouring your wine through a gadget which alters the experience for me in some situations ( like a romantic evening ) .#### #### ####[([96], [104], 'POS'), ([96], [93], 'POS'), ([4], [8], 'POS'), ([9], [7], 'POS'), ([11], [7], 'POS')]

I 've had a Donvier since the 80 's . I love the device and the concept probably more than the application . You do have to work fast with it or the build-up of rock-solid ice cream will make it next to impossible to move the blades . I 'm not surprised to read some have broken theirs , I 've often had to turn the blades with my hand over the center rather than the handle . It was that frozen . On the plus side , we have fresh ice cream or Italian ice most every evening . My husband and I are both lo-carb fanatics and making dessert with whipping cream , half and half , flavoring ( a bit of fruit , sugar free jello , nuts ... etc. ,) is wonderful . We do n't usually finish and the leftovers ( put in another container ) are ROCK solid . Just leave the bowl out for at least ten minutes and it can be served .#### #### ####[([92], [95], 'POS'), ([47], [52], 'POS'), ([127], [128], 'POS'), ([125], [128], 'POS'), ([47], [43], 'POS')]

This heavy , thick , enameled dutch oven pot is perfect for making roasts and pulled pork , two of my favorite slow cooked dishes. < br />< br /> To give this an initial test run , I modified a pulled pork recipe from Ree Drummond that called for a can of adobo chiles and a can of soda , among other things . It came out great ! It cooked in here for six hours at 300 and at the end was falling apart and cooked through without burning or drying . The whole thing was moistened due to the little dots on the lid that dispersed the liquid as it steamed to the top. < br />< br /> While I like the enamel coating inside and out , which makes it easy to clean and possible to put in the dishwasher if necessary , though it 's better not to , I would have been even happier with a true cast iron dutch oven where we could benefit not only from the even heat distribution but also the health benefits of cast iron . That said , the enamel is like a healthy version of nonstick and I appreciate the easy cleanup . And the other cast iron dutch oven I have that has a cast iron interior IS harder to clean after AND cost twice as much. < br />< br /> Overall if you want the health benefits of cast iron , look elsewhere , but if you want even cooking and easy cleanup when making dishes like roasts and pulled pork , this is a very well designed and low cost dutch oven. < br />< br /> Just do n't expect many recipes from Rick Bayliss available online for using this . My search for recipes from him using a Dutch oven came up with only a couple , and the included recipe book only had one recipe using this pot . Maybe I need to buy his books ?#### #### ####[([205], [209], 'POS'), ([212], [204], 'POS')]

I was so excited to receive my new Keurig as a birthday gift , as my last one of 5 + years was on its last legs for sure . For the first few weeks , it worked just fine . I love the needle cleaner , the larger water reservoir , and the general ease of K450 . The downsides are not being able to select a hot water brew larger than 6 oz . ( I need to run it twice to fill my husbands travel mug with tea ) , not being able to use a &# 34 ; my k cup &# 34 ; for ground coffee , and the biggest issue for me has been that I am consistently getting coffee grounds in my cup . A lot of grinds , not just a few but probably close to a teaspoon ! I have used the needle cleaner almost daily since this started , have avoided brewing anything larger than the 8oz cup , and this morning finally decided to run my already brewed coffee through a french press pot to get rid of the grinds . For whatever reason , it always seems worse on the second cup of the day , and when I open the pod holder , water and grinds run all over the counter . Needless to say , I am not so happy with this coffee maker , and may have to switch back to my old and dying one , or even just a regular old coffee brewer and give up the convenience of the Keurig .#### #### ####[([194], [202], 'NEG'), ([134], [139], 'NEG')]

Seems to work as expected. < br />< br /> I bought this to weigh my gear for backpacking in an effort to reduce unnecessary weight that I 'm carrying .

I love these ! They fit so well in my pantry . The lids are all the same size and fit well on all the containers ! That is a big plus to me .

No more broken glass containers / canisters for me !< br /> They are not space wasters , only space savers . I labeled each one , although the opaque plastic allows me to see what is inside .

I had previously ordered silicone egg rings to try and make perfectly round eggs for breakfast sandwiches . That was a disastrous mess .

I can make two sandwiches at a time , all at once , no mess . I made a dozen one morning and froze them for the month so we can just reheat them in the microwave .

Yes , it 's awesome .

Keeps drinks HOT for LONG time and is completely spill proof , but I do n't care for the way it opens to drink. < br />< br /> I 've been using the Thermos Stainless King , which I recommend instead of this , for years and LOVE it . I can put coffee in the Stainless King at 5:00am and it is still tongue burning hot at Noon and still drinkable warm at 5:00pm . My wife uses hers for cold water . If she starts off with a little ice in the water , it is still nicely cold tomorrow at the same time. < br />< br /> Let me say this first that this Thermos Travel Tumbler works equally as well as the Stainless King . It is outstanding at its job - keeping drinks hot or cold for unbelievable long times. < br />< br /> The only thing I do not like about it is that you have to push the button on the top to open and close it . If you are in a group ( such as in a meeting at work , etc. ) and if you have hot liquid like coffee it in , this creates a very audible &# 34 ; pop &# 34 ; as well as a &# 34 ; click click &# 34 ; when you open it and &# 34 ; click click &# 34 ; when you close it . This draws attention to you in a group - not appropriate for a business meeting , for example. < br />< br /> The Thermos Stainless King has a different action on top that can be controlled with your thumb and is practically silent . Since it works just as well , holds the same amount , and is also slightly less tall , I much prefer it . I 'm keeping this Tumbler for a backup .#### #### ####[([65], [73], 'POS')]

I love wine and I found this wine chiller by Devine to be an awesome product . For one it gives me the option of not having to keep my wine bottle in the fridge or on ice which is nice .

The wine was easy to pour and their was no mess . The wine chiller for me keep my wine cold from anywhere from one to two hours .

I 've had my Instant Pot for 5 months now and I LOVE it !!!! ! I saw something similar at Target and was going to purchase it ; however , I am glad that I did n't . The insert of that one was a cheap aluminum but the insert of this is a nice stainless steel . I 've used the pressure cooker option and the slow cooker option , plus I 've seared meats in it prior to pressure or slow cooking ..... works amazing ! The only thing I am disappointed in is that the rubber sealer got stained and held a smell after only a few times using it .

I cant say enough about this cool little gadget . I ordered one for a relative with loss of strength in their hands and had a hard time working a hand can opener but does n't like the big , clunky under the counter or counter top electric can openers that take up too much cabinet space . I gave one away and kept one for myself . My eight year old daughter loves it too ! There are no sharp edges and simple enough for kids to work . It wont start until it is atop a can , so you know it wont accidentally turn on in the drawer , larger cans just require you push the button a couple times , instead of once . Basically , you set this little gadget on the car , push the button and let it go . It rotates around the can until the lid is completely cut ( may require an additional push of button for big cans ) . Then you pick it up and the lid to stuck to a magnet on the tool . The edges are not sharp on either the can or the lid . It 's pretty cool !#### #### ####[([70], [80], 'POS')]

This is a great little product . It is super duper easy to use , just hold over a glass and pour the wine into the aerator and then enjoy a better tasting glass of wine. < br />< br /> I love the classy look of this Red Wine Aerator . It comes with a nice black holder that doubles as drip catcher . During my last dinner party I left it sitting next to the bottles of red wine and it was a conversation starter . Every one wanted to know what it was and then they had to try it out . We did lots of testing before and after so see if it made a difference . 90 % of the guest could tell a difference . It makes even a cheap bottle of wine taste much better. < br />< br /> The opening at the top is nice and big making it easy to pour the wine into the aerator without making a mess . It does not leak at all and only drips a few drops but does not cause a mess if you use the included holder . It is super easy to clean , just rinse out with warm water or throw it into the top rack of the dishwasher . I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review. < br />< br /> The kit comes with :< br /> Aerator < br /> Holder drip catcher < br /> Storage back < br />< br /> I highly recommend this to all red wine drinkers .#### #### ####[([63], [67], 'POS'), ([241], [233], 'POS'), ([138], [135], 'POS'), ([208], [207], 'POS')]

The seller sent another set and the grinders arrived in perfect condition . I 'm upgrading the rating to four stars based on the quality of the new product and the integrity of the seller . I 've had other sellers ask me to remove a review they did n't like ( which I never agree to ) , but this seller treated me like a customer should be treated and immediately offered to send a replacement product . Any product can be damaged during packing and shipping , so the integrity of the people you are buying from is at least as important as the quality of their products . One is n't worth much without the other. < br />< br />► Original Review Below ◄'< br />< br /> I bought [[ ASIN : B004LKVRLG Spice Lab 's Himalayan Dark Pink Coarse Crystal Salt ]] to go in the salt grinder along with multi colored pepper whole peppercorns that I liberated from these disposable grinders I bought last year ... [[ ASIN : B00275SBGQ Olde Thompson Pepper Supreme ]] and the result is a truly beautiful combination . I 'm a pretty no nonsense guy , but sometimes esthetics matter and the combination of the dark pink salt crystals with the multi-colored peppercorns inside the glass bulbs with stainless ends is absolutely beautiful. < br />< br /> The grinders work very well , but I have a few gripes that caused me to rate these 4 stars instead of 5 . The glass bulbs that hold the salt and pepper are very cheaply made and both have lines running the length of the glass . Additionally , one of the glass pieces arrived with a chip out of the rim and the broken glass sitting in the glass bulb . It 's nothing that prevented me from using the grinder , but still , it 's bad form to ship out a product that has a sliver of glass sitting inside the bowl where the customer is to put food stuffs . Luckily I saw the little sliver ; but I shudder to think of the possible implications if someone with poor eyesight had received my grinder set . My second gripe is that the lids appear identical , but when we mixed them up , one snapped in so tightly that we could barely get it back off and the other lid was so loose that it just fell off if you tipped the grinder upside down with the lid on . They should either fit exactly the same on each grinder or they should be marked with an &# 34 ; S &# 34 ; for salt and a &# 34 ; P &# 34 ; for pepper so that they are not easily confused. < br />< br /> In summation , the grinders work perfectly , and look great if loaded with the salt and pepper I linked to . I like them , and if not for the chipped glass on the one unit , they 'd be worthy of four stars . With better quality glass and the lid issue fixed , they are a five star product. < br />< br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟 and the other lid was so loose that it just fell off if you tipped the grinder upside down with the lid on .

this unit as received was too loud for an occupied room . It 's fans and compressor cycled very frequently which was a big distraction in our den . Then after a little more than a year it quit working completely . No repair manuals at the website . No schematics and troubleshooting steps in the instruction manual are useless . I have conclude this particular piece of Chinese junk is a waste of money and heartily recommend NOT buying it .#### #### ####[([66], [68], 'NEG'), ([43], [33], 'NEG'), ([16], [6], 'NEG')]

So , the order arrived complete with both straws , lids and inner seal in a timely fashion . No problem on that front . I do n't own a dishwasher , so I always washed it by hand , therefore I ca n't say anything in regards to how it stands higher temperature . What I can say is that it worked perfectly well , no sweating on the outside with colder drinks , up to the point where it randomly exploded. < br /> And I mean EXPLODED. < br /> I filled it with water ( room temperature water , as well , so no sudden temperature changes or anything ) , then I placed it on the table. < br /> I should have probably been more careful , as it fell off ( it had never fallen previously ) , but instead of bouncing or something ( the table is less than a meter high , so I totally expected it to withstand the fall ) the mug exploded all over the place . Luckily , I had moved away from the table already , otherwise I would have ended cut up to all hell . To be clear , it reacted to the fall as though it were made of glass . The other one , which I gave to my sister to use , has not given her any problem at all at this time , so it is possible mine just had a manufacturing problem to begin with that did n't manifest till now , but if you want to buy this product , be careful !#### #### ####[([101], [108], 'NEG'), ([8], [12], 'NEG'), ([70], [72], 'NEG'), ([153], [159], 'NEG')]

Product arrived broken . Mostly made of plastic ! What I thought was just a viewing window appears to be the actual cylinder that holds the contents of the mill . If the mill broke in transit somewhere along the line , I can not imagine it would last very long with actual use . The stand it came with appears cheap and the box that holds the set was busted open too , the whole contents were just floating around in the package it came it . Cheap mill , poor quality overall look , back it went .

I was pretty excited to try this product out after having one in the past . The bottle seemed to have a nice design at first , but I noticed right away that the bottom of the bottle was rounded a bit so it made the bottle wobble when standing up. < br /> Secondly , I drinking out of the bottle it a bit awkward . The top design has holes in it that the water comes out of and allows you to sit from . The holes are big so they also allow for seeds from the fruit to come through , which is something I did n't like ( ie. lemon seeds , watermelon seeds ) . I was planning on having that be the main issue with this bottle until I went to try to open it. < br /> The top tab to unscrew the basket from the bottle broke off and I cannot get the top to open again . I 've reattached it but the way it 's designed just makes it break off over and over again. < br /> I ended up having to throw the bottle away after one use because I obviously ca n't use it and the fruit is going rancid in there now ... . Do n't waste your money on this product until they have fixed their design flaws !< br /> I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review .#### #### ####[([96], [90], 'NEG'), ([146], [145], 'NEG'), ([61], [68], 'NEG')]

The Instant Pot is quickly becoming my go-to kitchen gadget . It is surprisingly versatile and SUPER easy to use . Plus , I feel very confident in its safety measures .

Took me about a week or so of convincing myself to try it out because it seemed a bit pricey until I bought this at the local Tuesday Morning for 21.99 . ZeroWater is seriously the best . I 've been using it for 1 1 / 2 years and I have never had any problems . Once you start comparing Pur / Brita to ZeroWater and ZeroWater blows them out of the water . It 's infinite times well worth the price for the taste and the amount of water you can store in the dispenser . Since I 've been using it for the last year and a half , I can tell when the filter is almost near changing around 003-004 and the taste of the water starts getting a bit heavy and a bit slimy to keep using it until 006 . I live in Colorado and my TDS score is 154 , so it takes me about 2 months to change filters . I am a lifelong fan and will never go back to using Pur .#### #### ####[([73], [77], 'POS'), ([78], [80], 'POS')]

I bought this yogurt maker after doing much reading about yogurt makers and this one seemed to be rated well . I knew that yogurt is known as a healthy food due to the live bacteria in it that is good for the gut . Because the jars are so hot when I take them out of the machine , I started taking the temperature of the yogurt with my highly rated , known for its accuracy , electronic thermometer . It 's running between 130-136 degrees when I pull the jars out . From what I 've read , that 's way too hot for yogurt bacteria to live in . Pretty much defeats the purpose of making yogurt . I had extra yogurt mix when I made it last night so poured it into a large jar then wrapped it in multiple layers of towel . Guess what , I checked it after 11 hours and it worked great ! Nice yogurt without all the heat . This is my new plan . I 'd heated the milk to 200 degrees before cooling to 112 degrees to add the starter so I know the milk was well pasteurized , and the starter bacteria are supposed to keep the milk from going bad . Sometimes the old way of doing things is best !#### #### ####[([131], [130], 'NEG'), ([131], [137], 'NEG'), ([210], [213], 'NEG'), ([218], [217], 'NEG'), ([138], [137], 'NEG')]

This set looks great , although the functionality of the pepper grinder in particular is fairly awful . Because the pepper is released from the bottom of the shaker , after use the pepper leaks on anything that is it set upon ( like the kitchen counter ) .

Next time , I 'd choose a shaker where the pepper is released from the top to avoid the constant mess .#### #### ####[([11], [16], 'NEG'), ([66], [65], 'NEG')]

We got this in April and despite the fact that it was painfully slow ( one donut every 90 seconds ) it was hours ( because that 's how long it took to make a batch ) of fun . We watched , waited and ate . I pulled it out of the box for the third time and the parts inside the machine had broken . Plastic fell out and the plug attachment was pushing in all the way into the machine . It 's also really hard to clean out and we had to scrub it and still found mold . I contacted the company and was basically told too bad . I 'm a sucker for good customer service , but given the response I got after only a few uses I do n't think I 'll be buying anything more from this company .

Big size a little too heavy and large . Small and medium are great . Unfortunately several broke ( at least 6 or 8 ) in the first two days .

These glasses are lightweight , hold a great amount of liquid , great for kids and adults to use outside on the patio , at the lake or at the park . I loved the post card the company put in the box . It let me know that they truly care about the products they put out and want every purchase to have a personal touch . The grape wine charm was a great accent and it truly embellishes the glass along with any of the other wine charms Simply Charmed sells . Any liquid you put in it does n't make you feel like you are not drinking out of a truly nice glass .

I am really enjoying these mugs . This coffee mug came as a 2 pack product . The first thing I must comment on is the packaging . Not only were these mugs shipped in an Amazon box full of bubble wrap but the box for the mugs was also double wrapped in bubble wrap . I 'm including a picture of the wrapped box since I was so impressed with the delivery handling . These mugs are actual glass but are not the weight of usual glass mugs . This can be an asset to individuals with strength disabilities such as arthritis . However , because of this lightweight design this is a cup best handled by adults due to the fragile nature . When it comes to the double-wall insulation the Epar & eacute ; mug performs flawlessly . While brewing coffee there was no condensation on the outside of the mug and the mug was cool to touch . The coffee stayed warm for 30 min which is much longer than some of my regular glass mugs . These mugs are large enough for the large cup setting on the Keurig coffee maker . My only concern with these mugs would be my grandchildren getting ahold of them and accidentally dropping one . I am not sure how well they would hold up in that situation. < br /> Pros :< br /> * Very light weight glass < br /> * Crystal clear < br /> * Smooth rim that feels good while drinking beverage < br /> * No condensation on outside of mug < br /> * Keeps beverage warm longer than traditional glass mugs < br /> * Very appealing to the eye < br /> Cons :< br /> * Fragile ( use caution around young children )< br /> * Extremely lightweight ( you may be ready to pick up a heavy mug but remember it 's very light )< br /> So , overall these mugs are 5 star for this over 50 woman with arthritis . I just have to be cautious around the grandchildren . Enjoy !

This is a nice size and it is durable . The handle is a good size for your hand and its shape makes it easy to maneuver and comfortable . That means it 's thicker than many handles , so it takes up more room in the vertical utensil holder I keep it in next to the stove , but I do n't care about that. . The only reason I give it four stars and not five is that the blade is n't as flexible as I would like . That 's just a matter of personal preference , so it might be five stars for everybody else .

I have nothing to compare it to , but I like the coffee , and the process of making it is easy and fun . I live in a small space , so I especially like that the makers thought of compact storage .

I really liked the Magic Bullet Mini . I have used it every day for the past 5 months and it has performed well . It seems impossible to insert the container the wrong way into the motor base , but my sister used it and somehow managed to shred the gear teeth on the container base . For that reason , I would say it 's a 4-star product. < br />< br /> Amazon 's review policy forbids me from commenting on my experience directly with the seller . My detailed review was rejected . Nevertheless , you can see that my overall experience with this product is 1 star .#### #### ####[([13], [16], 'NEG'), ([31], [33], 'NEG'), ([89], [92], 'NEG')]

Heavy duty cutting board - significantly more robust than the Epicurian &# 34 ; Prep Series &# 34 ; cutting boards I also have in my kitchen .

Works pretty well but jumps around more than I 'd expect . I had a jar freeze up after about 18 months and they replaced it no problem . However I did notice a TON of black dust from the old jar , and now that I have a brand new jar the same exact thing is occurring . Googling yields a lot of hits for this problem and it apparently is a result of the design. < br />< br /> Whenever this blender dies I 'm getting a Vitamix .#### #### ####[([41], [50], 'POS'), ([51], [54], 'POS')]

I received this 6 piece silicone cooking set to review and I love it . I love all things silicone in my kitchen . It was a purely genius idea . I love the fun and bright colors of the set , too . It is suggested that the bright colors elevate your mood , but it is also helpful to find or describe the piece that you are looking for . And I feel confident in the product to let my teen daughters use them while I teach them how to cook . The set has everything that you need in the kitchen , it would make a great housewarming gift or be a fantastic purchase for teens leaving home for college . The set is made of professional grade silicone and withstand temperatures up to 600 degrees Fahrenheit . They are very comfortable to use . I make a lot of desserts and usually the ingredients need to be whipped into a smooth , thick batter . This set allows me to do that , comfortably . I love the green multipurpose stirrer and probably use that the most from the set . My husband loves omelets and always goes for the teal omelet flipper . It just makes the job so much easier . His omelets turn out perfect every time . We also eat a lot of chili and soups so the ladle is getting a lot of use in the kitchen as well . This set is really great . I love that the pieces do not stain or hold smells from the foods in them . I hate when cheaper versions I have in my house are permanently stained with chili , spaghetti or dessert ingredients . These wont do that . I also like how easy they are to clean . I wash mine by hand with hot soapy water , but they are completely dishwasher safe . One of the best features of the set is that they are all one unified piece . The handle is an extension of the utensil and that means that clean up is easy , but it also means that you will know that you have a very clean utensil because there is no where for good or bacteria to hide and grow ! The box that they come in is super fun . It has little quips and personality , just having the package is worth the order . And it is great to havein your house . Perfect for gifting , too .#### #### ####[([268], [275], 'POS'), ([229], [221], 'POS'), ([118], [109], 'POS')]

I have been looking for salt and pepper grinders like these for some time : good size for table or kitchen and not necessary to fill all the time .

I 've only had the scale a couple weeks but seems to be a first class product . Weighed the same amount of gold 3 different times with three exact same results . A couple minor issues , it would be nice if this scale came with a small tub for weighing small flakes and fines and if this tub had its own place in the carry pouch . Although a quick trip to the local Wally World located a small smooth-inside plastic container minus the lid to weigh flakes , fines , and dust .

Great little scale . I 've had another American Weigh Scales product that had the traditional compact construction . This one is far sturdier , something I had concerns about in terms of the control arm that swings away from the body . The design of the scale using convenient plastic covers that double as trays is really nice . The fact hat it uses standard batteries rather than button batteries , all the better . Simple controls . Clean design . Sturdy .

I had originally purchased one of these for my son to use for school lunch last year and we had some problems with the lid . I was n't sure at the time if I 'd received a defective set or if it just was n't of very high quality and wrote a review stating as much . Bentgo contacted me and offered to replace the defective set and we could n't be happier . Now that we are the proud owners of a second set , I 'm thrilled ! This is a great product -- the previous lid HAD been defective and the new one works perfectly and smoothly . I love that I can pack a healthy lunch for my son every day and not have to worry about BPA and other gross stuff contaminating his food and he loves that the box ( plus bag and cup ) fit perfectly in his backpack and are n't too heavy like the metal containers . Thank you Bentgo !

This is such a sweet simple and beautiful piece . While it is not very large , it is just a perfect center piece for a mantel or dinner table . The colors are full and rich . This piece is matching to a much I bought also mad by Kiltrea Pottery . Its a nice light but extremely well made piece that stands out in a room . I plan on buying another one as a wedding gift for my brother . If you are looking for something to make your serving stand out then this is the piece . It is also Dishwasher safe according to a little sticker on the bottom , although personally I will only hand wash it . There is much else to say , besides just how pleased I am .

When reading the bad reviews on this product , I was sceptical and bought them anyway . I have had a refillable basket at home that has worked flawlessly for over two years now , and was needing one for work , now that we have a Keurig of our own. < br />< br /> Well , the reviews were correct , and this product is complete garbage . It 's not that the product leaks like some of the reviews claim , but the fact that , it makes the coffee so lightly brewed and tastes like dirty water not coffee . I am actually a person that likes weak coffee , so these claims did n't scare me away from ordering these . Well , it makes brownish water. < br />< br /> After the fact I looked at my current Keurig basket at home , and it 's called a Solofill Cup . They are much more expensive , but they work . I 'll be ordering another Solofill and throwing these four baskets in the garbage can where they belong .#### #### ####[([108], [99], 'NEG'), ([92], [99], 'NEG'), ([7], [11], 'NEG'), ([102], [111], 'NEG'), ([112], [111], 'NEG')]
This \\" Scrigit \\" scraping tool is 6 3 / 16 in. long and is made of sturdy plastic . It has both curved and straight tips that can be used for removing stickers , cleaning crevices , peeling up wax , opening packages , and even disassembling electronics. < br />< br /> The edges are very sharp and do a great job . I have used an orange stick for similar tasks , but this tool works much better . It can remove a sticker from just about anything , and with minimal damage to the surface it is a attached to. < br />< br /> There is a pocket clip on the side , which is probably handy for many people , but I would prefer to have a plain tool , as the end without the clip is slightly easier to handle. < br />< br /> The Scrigit has earned its place in the pencil cup on my desk and in the kitchen drawer , and I wish I had another to keep in the toolbox. < br />< br /> Scrigit provided tools for evaluation and review .#### #### ####[([73], [72], 'POS'), ([113], [121], 'POS'), ([55], [62], 'POS')]

i use this machine to chop spices and bread crumbs . I love how easy it is to remove and clean , but definitely do n't grind for more than a couple seconds ... Forget 20 seconds , smells like the machine will burn out , max is more lie 8-10 seconds pulsed. < br /> Good for turning dried bread ( 1cm chunks ) into breadcrumbs , any larger and nothing gets broken down. < br /> My chia seeds did n't get ground down , but flaxseed seems to work okay .#### #### ####[([71], [69], 'POS'), ([32], [28], 'POS'), ([62], [69], 'POS'), ([9], [14], 'POS')]

They are pretty little jars . They look good in the cabinet . However , many of them do n't seal well . Also , the closing hooks come right off and sometimes do n't go back on well .

It does what we want - brew a good cup of coffee with K cups or our own coffee . We discovered that we need to push down the Kcups so that they are punctured on the bottom before closing the top . We live at 7500 ' and if the top needle was the first to puncture them , the coffee pods were sort of exploding and seemed to plug the needle . The quality of the coffee is excellent ! The real test will be long term . In two years we have gone through 2 other brewers , so we are hopeful that this one lasts longer .#### #### ####[([99], [98], 'POS')]

These mitts are great . Although at first I thought they would be too big for my hands , they are fine since they are non-slip , protect your forearms , and can be used by lefties or righties -- the protection is uniform throughout the mitt . With ordinary mitts , I could never make it from the oven to the kitchen counter without the heat becoming very unpleasant , making me have to rush .

A wine foil cutter falls into the category of &# 34 ; things that I did n't know I needed. &# 34 ; There are a lot of similar devices , and I suspect that all of them work just about the same way . The Peak Reserve cutter is flat black and unobtrusive , and comes in an elegant black box. < br />< br /> I have suggested to the manufacturer that changing the size of the &# 34 ; throat &# 34 ; could add to its functionality by making it possible to use the same tool to extract a cork from an already opened bottle of wine . Using a couple of layers of self-fusing rubber tape added to the inner surface , I tried this and it worked exactly as expected , removing a cork without having to reach for a pair of pliers. < br />< br /> DISCLAIMER : This product was provided for a fair and balanced review .#### #### ####[([61], [59], 'POS'), ([99], [98], 'POS'), ([46], [53], 'POS'), ([46], [51], 'POS'), ([116], [124], 'POS')]

When this arrived , it came in a very nice , sleek black box with inlets for the corkscrew and wine stopper . The stopper is very heavy and works extremely well . It feel like possibly steel . The corkscrew is a very solid piece of aluminum or something with a very elegant wooden handle . I drink wine frequently and this works on both small and large bottles with ease . Much better than my cheap opener from the grocery store . I honestly prefer the old fashioned corkscrews to the new , electric ones . It feels more classy .

The salad shaker is attractive . I have found several ugly salad dressing shakers . The bottle opens in the middle to add ingredients for salad dressing .

The Silicone Wine Glasses and Collapsible Pouch are a great way to take my wine to a Grill out , Camping , Beach Party or even over to a friend ’s house . I like the fact that I can open my wine at home and let it breathe than put it in the pouch . That way I do n’t have to take the wine bottle opener and worry about dropping / breaking the bottle. < br />< br /> When I received the Silicone Wine Glasses I ran them through my dishwasher twice to get the slight plastic smell gone . I have washed them numerous times after using them and have not had any problems with wine residue . They clean up like new. < br />< br /> I have used these to make a Gin & Tonic so I could go out and enjoy our patio . I do n’t want to break glass on the pavers . I am not very graceful and break a glass cup or plate every once in a while .

The product is fine , but I think I had a different expectation of how it was supposed to work . First of all , you really need to put it on a cookie sheet before putting any batter in it . The material is really floppy and once it is filled , is nearly impossible to move , let alone put in the oven . I could have filmed my own comedy-reality cooking show the first time I ever used this . Lucille Ball would have been proud . Second of all , it 's not as non-stick as one would believe it to be . All I made was muffins and the bottoms stuck in so bad that they ripped apart from the tops . Disappointing . However , what I really liked was that once you took it out of the oven , it did n't continue to cook the muffins , so they were perfectly browned and not burnt on the bottom at all . Win ! The product itself is good but I think my expectations ruined the experience for me .#### #### ####[([83], [76], 'NEU'), ([1], [3], 'NEU'), ([114], [118], 'NEU'), ([73], [71], 'NEU'), ([73], [76], 'NEU')]

So far , so good !< br />< br /> TIPS : The lid should go on easily -- - if it does n't , you 've probably got something in the wrong place . The top handle with the little metal piece sticking out lines up with the bottom handle that says ' Open &# 60 ;&# 62 ; Close ' . The thin inner lid goes in so you can still read the engraved &# 34 ; Pull out to clean &# 34 ; . If the lid wo n't fasten , you 've probably got the narrow silicone gasket on upside down . Remove it gently and put it on the other way. < br />< br /> Be careful when you press the buttons - if your fingertip is on the right one and your fingernail hits the wrong one , it goes to the wrong setting .#### #### ####[([101], [99], 'POS'), ([33], [32], 'POS')]

These work as described , although they 're not quite as pictured . The plastic is pretty thick , and most comparable to the translucent bags sold for travel to get carry-on toiletries through TSA security screening . It 's not as transparent as the pictures indicate , although you would be able to tell the contents , assuming it 's not frozen mystery meat . Because it 's so thick , it 's not quite as accomodating as a regular disposable bag : the seams wont ' open quite as far , but they 're suitable for most objects that you 'd want to seal shut. < br />< br /> The zippers are quite secure : I filled one halfway with water , closed it , and squeezed , with no leaks. < br />< br /> However , these are rather pricey , definitely not a cost saving measure . I do n't yet know how well these will hold up over time , but if I notice they wear out quickly , I 'll update this review ( it would 't be much of a benefit to have to replace much thicker plastic more often ).< br />< br /> These might be particularly useful in non-food applications , such as toiletries , diaper bag , etc .#### #### ####[([82], [80], 'POS'), ([211], [210], 'POS'), ([31], [21], 'POS')]

This has enough cushioning to it to make the standing bearable for at least twice as long with not problem . It cleans off very easily with broom or damp cloth . The beveled edges have eliminated the problem of tripping over the edge like some rugs . We are very pleased .#### #### ####[([69], [72], 'POS'), ([85], [90], 'POS'), ([82], [72], 'POS'), ([34], [41], 'POS'), ([66], [72], 'POS')]
This is pretty handy – I use this to clean my large Tervis tumbler of the iced tea stains I ca n’t reach by hand . The curved tip at the end really helps with the narrow bottom , and the bristles are firm enough to scrape away but not too stiff that you feel you are damaging whatever it is you may be scrubbing . At $ 3.99 and free shipping if you ’re a Prime member , this sure beats having to make a separate trip to the store to find something similar .#### #### ####[([17], [11], 'POS'), ([77], [70], 'POS'), ([13], [3], 'POS'), ([93], [94], 'POS'), ([90], [94], 'POS')]

Living in a humid environment it is a battle to prevent mold and mildew . The battle is even more important when you have chemical and mold sensitivities . This bag helps . The laundry closet is normally a stinky place due to its nature . This bag cuts down on the moisture and odors. < br /> I really do like that it is reusable , for two years ! ! . I love that . Does n’t use chemicals to take away smells and you do n’t need smelly cleaners to clean it . All that you need to do is put it in the sun to “ recharge ”< br /> My gripe is that the bag is not attractive and the cord looks dirty . It is not , it is simply that the cord is not bleached white . It would be nice for this bag to be aesthetically pleasing as well . Not only because it would be used in visible places but also to balance the price / size / visual value .#### #### ####[([47], [39], 'POS'), ([84], [90], 'POS'), ([173], [177], 'POS')]

So , I am an avid outdoor wine drinker and I am always looking for thing to enhance this experience . These are GREAT . Even though the description said silicone , I was n't expecting them to be collapsible , but they are soft-sided . Hard enough to hold liquor , but soft enough that they can stay packed with my picnic stuff and I do n't have to worry about scratches or dents . My wine stayed cool and did n't warm from me holding the glass which was another concern . I would love to have them in another color as well .

I 'm disappointed in this machine . I bought it about 2 years ago , and it has developed problems dispensing the proper amount of water . It seems to strain to pump the water ( makes a lot of noise ) then , poof , a dribble . It takes me four cycles to make what should be made in one cycle . After cleaning , it was a little better for a week , but then it returned to its fail state . I checked on-line about whether there was any way I could repair it and found there are many other disappointed customers . The conjecture is that Keurig under-powered its pump for its &# 34 ; quieter &# 34 ; home models. < br />< br /> I 've reluctantly replaced it with the office-grade K145 . It does n't have the blue light in the tank and some other bells-and-whistles , but it is supposed to have a stronger pump . I hope IT lasts more than 2 years !#### #### ####[([105], [102], 'NEU'), ([108], [102], 'NEU')]

Love it so far . I believe this will be one of the best investments I 've ever made . I hate bottled water and average filtered water is not to my standard . After my first sip of filtered water from this Berkey , I knew I hit gold - sofest / purest water I 've ever tasted . I 'm relieved I can finally give myself and my family the best water option possible . I would recommend dumping remaining water from the filter area when filtering is complete so make sure that the glue does not come undone quickly over time .#### #### ####[([70], [75], 'POS'), ([40], [36], 'POS')]

We have two Tervis Tumblers . My husband received one as a gift from our daughter earlier this year . It 's 16 oz and proclaims him as &# 34 ; The Best Dad Ever. &# 34 ; It 's been lightly used for iced tea . I purchased a 12 oz Tumbler for myself with my Alma mater 's logo . It has been used only once or twice for iced coffee . It 's main function is as a decoration in our kitchen window. < br /> But now I 'm ready to throw them both out because they 've both apparently lost their vacuum and developed a white film in between the supposedly insulating layers . Now they 're nothing more than eyesores. < br /> By contrast , the double-walled insulated glass that I got from Starbucks over three years ago is just as crystal-clear as the day I purchased it . And it 's used daily . Check out the attached photo and compare the relative visibility of the fence rails looking through the glasses . ( And all three glasses are fresh out of the dishwasher. )< br /> BTW , these were both purchased directly , at full price , from the Tervis Tumbler website . I therefore assume neither was a &# 34 ; second. &# 34 ;< br /> Bottom line : do n't waste your money on drinkware by Tervis Tumbler !! !#### #### ####[([143], [148], 'NEG')]

I tried asking a question before purchasing these and received no response from the seller after waiting weeks . But I purchased these along with another set just in case . Unfortunately , I ended up choosing the other set for my salt & pepper shakers . Pros : glass bottom Large holes for coarse pepper or sea salt . Able to seal against humidity Cons : plastic top ( NOT STAINLESS STEEL ) Flip tops must be held open until the plastic hinges are flexible enough to stay up on their own . Large open still too small to fit a teaspoon measurement spoon . Lid just looks and feels cheap . Conclusion : It was n't worth the time or cost of shipping to return them , so I kept them hoping I can find a spice that I can put in them . Right now they are just sitting empty in my cabinet though while I use the holder for my nicer salt & pepper shakers which fit into it perfectly .#### #### ####[([57], [51], 'NEG'), ([42], [51], 'NEG'), ([102], [111], 'NEG'), ([104], [95], 'NEG')]
I have only used it once and I am not impressed with the design . I 've worked in many kitchens and you need full oil coverage ideally if the food is to fry & cook correctly . The problem with the design is that it is too long and not deep enough to allow the drain function to work correctly , let me explain. < br />< br /> First , since the heat conductors are elevated from the bottom of where the oil is , you lose about an inch including when you place the basket in . The minimum & maximum fill lines for the oil are way too shallow due to the length of the fryer . I filled it to a little over the maximum oil level just to get better coverage although the organic , bone-in chicken breast I was frying was peaking out of the oil and had to be turned so it could completely fry on all sides . I was tempted to fill the fryer with even more oil but luckily ( I will explain below ) I had pretty much ran out of oil. < br />< br /> Second , the reason you cannot add go much over the maximum fill line ( the fryer is definitely big enough to hold much more ) is because of the easy drain function . When I fried all eight parts of my personal &# 34 ; Mock Pioneer Chicken &# 34 ; recipe , I used my metal strainer and got rid of most of the bigger pieces of batter floating around ( they tasted soooo goood !) . When it finished draining ( this feature is awesome by the way ) , the plastic container almost overflowed as I had put more than the maximum level of oil . This is what limits the otherwise decent fryer. < br />< br /> So , if anyone can please let me know what I 'm doing wrong ( I do n't see how I am ) please let me know . I bought this based on all the great reviews but I do n't see how you can comfortably fry much , my cast iron skillet holds basically the same amount of oil allowed . The best work around would be to fill it up with much more oil and NOT use the easy drain feature but this makes me think the heating element may not function properly as it was only designed to heat up so much oil. < br />< br /> I am open to suggestions , I even had some great chicken but it was much more of a hassle than I expected . I bought the fryer because it is such a pain to do in my cast iron / other pans but I may just stick to those.suggestions , I even had some great chicken but it was much more of a hassle than I expected .

It definitely keeps my coffee warm from 5am to 4pm . The vacuum has held up , too . However , the vacuum button had a piece on top that fell off and it is now much shorter than it was and it 's hard to tell if it is closed or open . Also , I had to take a sharpie pen and put hash marks next to the button to tell me where the openings were so I knew where to put my mouth . Otherwise , it 's hard to see and it could have been near my cheek when I went to drink . That would have been unpleasant ! Yet , I still use it everyday for work ( in an office ) .#### #### ####[([62], [52], 'NEU'), ([9], [5], 'NEU')]

It does the job BUT ... . The handle on mine is crooked and every time it gets to the bottom I smash my fingers on the base . The first time I used it one of the teeth broke off when it hit the end . You have to stop with about a quarter inch of veggie left.The process is very messy , as the veggies come out the base plate moves forward so there 's no catching all of them in a container . Cabbage is impossible , unless the head is as small as an apple . It nicely seeds smaller zucchini , that 's a plus .

We have very , very poor water quality where we live . We looked at all sorts of filters and filtration systems for our home . The replacement cost of the refrigerator filters was high and it was pricey for under the sink filters as well . Generally the filters do not get all the bad things out of the water and RARELY do they put good minerals back into the drinking water . The Zen water system gives you clean , clear drinking water along with healthy and necessary minerals for your body to function at its best. < br /> We put ours on our hot / cool water cooler . The only reason I am not giving it all the stars , is because if it is not just right in the center of the cooler , there is leaking . Also , it takes like a day or two for the water to flow faster then a drip from the top holding area to the bottom . Once it starts going it is fine. < br /> The neighbor kids call our water , &# 34 ; the best water in town. &# 34 ; They could obviously taste the difference and we feel the same way !

This pan is magical !!!!!!< br />< br /> My cooking has improved dramatically since I switched from cast iron to this. < br />< br /> Cleaning is super easy and the pan surface heats evenly even over a small electric burner. < br />< br />-- EDIT < br />< br /> No longer magical . The pan got sticky . But the company took it back months later .#### #### ####[([59], [61], 'NEG'), ([33], [40], 'NEG')]
I had long taken a cavalier attitude that there was very little difference between rolling pins . Even when celebrity chefs were talking up their solid maple , simple cylinders , I stuck with my tried and true traditional one . But then , perhaps because of their contemporary stylings , I went out on a limb and bought KMN 's Aluminum Rolling Pin . Now , I can not use anything else. < br />< br /> Originally funded as a Kickstarter campaign , it is made of aircraft grade aluminum ( okay , that has it sold to all the men ) . It has great feel in your hands , and rolls very easily . Because of the textured surface you get a layer of fine flour that prevents sticking . You can also refrigerate the pin , and it will stay cold when working butter-doughs . The measurement markings make it super simple to roll your crust to the correct size . Finally , the metallic colors ( I have the blue one ) look really good .#### #### ####[([12], [11], 'POS'), ([6], [11], 'POS'), ([108], [107], 'POS'), ([148], [156], 'POS'), ([19], [25], 'POS')]
This is gorgeous cookware ! This large pot is cast iron , but clad with red enamel on the outside and beige inside . Being cast iron it cooks very evenly , and you can use it on the top of the stove or in the oven . The quality of this piece is amazing . We like to cook , and we have a lot of high end cookware . This instantly became the best pot in our kitchen . I did a chili today after it arrived , and it was awesome and even easy to clean . It says it is dishwasher safe , but I doubt if I will even let a dishwasher near this . Plus , it is heavy , and might be a bit much for the racks . If you want a really nice pot , this is it . I will be buying more from this series .#### #### ####[([85], [93], 'POS'), ([130], [124], 'POS'), ([7], [2], 'POS')]

I did n't know this rice cooker is sooooooo tiny ... It only could cook a maximum of 1,5cups of rice . Please notice that the cup size came with the rice cooker so it might be smaller than the other cup sizes . It took like around half hour to cook a cup of rice . The size suits me well though coz I just need cooked rice for my boy . Another thing is that , if you cook 1,5cups brown rice in it , somewhat , the ' juice ' of the brown rice would bubble up when the machine is working and the lid will be very messy . I still give it 4 stars though ... coz of the cuteness and it function well to serve my needs .#### #### ####[([16], [9], 'POS')]

I live in a house divided ... My husband is the red wine drinker. . I 'm the white wine drinker ... Only occasionally do the two worlds meet :) When he DOES decide to enjoy a glass of white wine with me , he really wants it to be well chilled , as do I . Nothing worse than tepid or warm white wine , especially outdoors in the summer. < br /> Having to bother with messy ice buckets or chiller buckets on the table is just not the ideal arrangement so when we found this product online , we were excited to try it !< br /> We already used an aerator anyway so finding a chiller and aerator in one was a bonus since aerating really does make a difference in how the wine tastes. < br /> Kitchen Ezentials gave us an opportunity to try this 4 in 1 product at a promotional price to get our honest opinion and feedback so we were happy to be test subjects ! ;)< br /> We were impressed with the quality of the components of this - solid construction , simple but elegant design and easy to operate. < br /> Just wash the stainless steel rod and put it in the freezer for a couple of hours until its frozen then attach it to the aerator pour top and insert into the open bottle of wine. < br /> We tested this on both a bottle of room temperature wine and an already chilled bottle and , of course , the bottle that was already chilled stayed cold much longer - about an hour . The bottle of room temperature wine did cool down quite a bit once the chiller was inserted , but not nearly as much as the other. < br /> The aerator pour top is a smooth , clean pour without dripping and I really like that it seals off so you do n't have to keep putting the cork back in the bottle. < br /> This really is a great product to have on hand especially for summer outdoor dinners !< br /> I 've already added this to my shopping list for this Christmas for friends and family who are wine lovers ! This is a no brainer !< br /> Even if someone already owns one of these , having an extra or two is GREAT for dinner parties since there 's always more than one bottle of white wine !< br /> For companies who give their clients a bottle of wine for special occasions , this would be a wonderful addition to a gift basket :)< br /> Why did n't I find this sooner ?!!!< br /> Hope this was helpful info for you as you shop :)< br /> Enjoy ! e bottle of white wine !< br /> For companies who give their clients a bottle of wine for special occasions , this would be a wonderful addition to a gift basket :)< br /> Why did n't I find this sooner ?!!!< br /> Hope this was helpful info for you as you shop :)< br /> Enjoy !#### #### ####[([262], [271], 'POS'), ([208], [207], 'POS')]

I 'll never buy a Cuisinart product again . I 've had issues with most Cuisinart products I 've purchased in the past and am happy to put them in any garage sale . I bought this to replace a workhorse Sunbeam that I had for years . I liked this juicer a lot when it first arrived . It spins both ways to extract the most juice from your citrus , then has a &# 34 ; spin cycle &# 34 ; to extract any remaining juice out of the pulp . After approx. 2 ½ months , the juicer went into permanent &# 34 ; spin &# 34 ; mode spewing the juice and pulp everywhere . Amazon only has a 30 day return policy so I called Cuisinart customer service . Cuisinart said they would send me a new one if I paid for shipping at $ 10 + dollars and pay to ship the faulty unit back - basically the cost of the juicer ! They were very unapologetic and overall very poor customer service with the call ending in , &# 34 ; can I do anything else for you today ?&# 34 ; Click .#### #### ####[([31], [25], 'NEG'), ([22], [25], 'NEG')]

* I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. *< br />< br /> I love these little liners . I am not a great cook , but I do enjoy baking . Cupcakes and muffins are so fun and easy due to their single-serving size , and are some of my favorite things to make . A lot of the time , however , I find that I do n't quite have enough liners for whatever I am making , and I also dislike the waste of such a product . These cups were so appealing to me due to their ease of use , but even more so that they are re-usable . Much less waste , and I love that these are sturdy enough that I can even use these liners alone on a baking sheet , and not only to line a muffin pan as most paper or foil liners are used . These come in fun colors , and are n't all that difficult to clean , it is totally worth it . I have n't tried washing them in the dishwasher yet because they are so light , but I think in a cage where they can move around without floating freely around the dishwasher , they should be just fine . Soaking them is also easy and the grooves and edges are n't so deep that bits will get really stuck anyway . I think these are fun and a great addition to my kitchen , and they will get a lot of repeated use .#### #### ####[([7], [14], 'POS')]

I like the flat bottom feature of this loose leaf stainless steel tea infuser by comfify . It 's so cool how you can just press to handle to open infuser and then dig in to the container of the tea and close it and then just put in a hot water in your cup , let it infuse and enjoy . It 's so much easier than the one I 've used before . I do n't mind having the loose powder or small pieces of leaf that comes out from it . It also preserves the flavor and aroma of the tea that I 'm drinking which makes it more enticing for me to drink . It is very easy to clean you just press to handle open it throw all the infused or used tea leaf into the trash can and then run it with water and that 's it . I love the companies that have the confidence to give 100 % satisfaction money back guarantee and hassle-free lifetime warranty.I was lucky enough to be able to purchase this for a discounted price in exchange for my objective and equitable review .#### #### ####[([186], [193], 'POS'), ([13], [20], 'POS'), ([11], [8], 'POS'), ([4], [8], 'POS'), ([169], [175], 'POS')]

I absolutely love this coffee grinder . It 's the perfect size for me and easily can grind me enough coffee to make four cups . I only use it one cup at a time though , but still , it 's perfect . I was worried about the handle falling off , but it so easily attaches and does n't ever slip out of my hand or off the coffee grinder . It 's really well put together and the middle part easily detaches so that I can get to my coffee grinds right away. < br />< br /> Overall , I would definitely recommend purchasing one of these , especially if you are a traveler and want to bring along a little french press . This grinder will easily fit into your bag no problem and it even comes with a bag you can put it in to keep it safe and protected . It also comes with a free cleaning brush , which makes it so easy to clean . I have n't even had to use the brush yet because a simply rinse is all it really needs .

This slicer is my favorite kitchen tool ! I live on salads and roasted vegetables , and the mandolin slicer has made preparation effortless ! I can now slice vegetables very thin for making roasted veggie chips and easily grate more difficult vegetables like beets and carrots to top off my salads . The slicer is very sturdy , easy to operate safely and a breeze to clean up . The storage tray for the extra pieces is very handy . I highly recommend this gadget for anyone who enjoys frequent consumption of fresh vegetables ! !#### #### ####[([72], [79], 'POS')]

I remember when I was a kid & the pressure cooker exploded in our kitchen . Yikes ! That was the OLD style . This one is VERY safe & easy to use .

This is one of the few cookers I 've researched that does n't have a Teflon lining in the inner pot . That 's good . Teflon lining is made up of chemicals that are known carcinogens .

Works great ! My Gaggia was performing really poorly . Between using a proper decalcifying agent ( Cafiza ) and this device , which forces the machine to do a backflush , it got back to new ! I had tried a hack ( using a piece of rubber cut to the regular filter cup ) but this definitely works better ! Note , this device can be used only on machines that accommodate the back flashing ! Back flushing is only for Gaggias or other machines with a 3-way solenoid ( e.g. The Classic and some Babys ) . Do not attempt to backflush machines that do not have a 3-way valve . Gaggias with a 3-way valve have a drain of some sort into the drip tray .#### #### ####[([30], [36], 'POS'), ([17], [13], 'POS')]

I recently received one of these cookers as a gift . It seems to work great ... as long as you put the silicone gasket on the right way .... . * blush *< br />< br /> But when they say it 's a &# 34 ; 6-quart &# 34 ; or &# 34 ; 8-quart &# 34 ; , that is basically a lie . They insist that you do n't fill it above the MAX line of the inner pot . While the inner pot itself will hold 6 or 8 quarts if you fill it right up to the very brim , measuring to the MAX line limits you to 5 or 7 quarts , depending on which size unit you have. < br />< br /> Re : canning -- Do n't do any canning in it that would normally require a pressure canner . If you want to can high-acid foods in it ( normally suitable for water-bath canning ) , that is fine . Examples of high-acid foods : apples , applesauce , apricots , berries , cherries , cranberries , fruit juices , oranges , peaches , pears , pickled beets , pineapple , plums , rhubarb . ( Incl. jams & jellies. )< br />< br /> And you can only use PINT jars , not quarts . Mouth size does n't matter. < br />< br /> DO NOT can low-acid foods in it like asparagus , beans , beets , carrots , corn , hominy , meat , mushrooms , okra , peas , potatoes , seafood , spinach or squash , etc . Here is the reason , from the National Center for Food Preservation http :// nchfp.uga.edu / publications / nchfp / factsheets / pressurecookers.html < br />< br />&# 34 ; USDA does not have recommended processes for canning in a small pressure cooker . The recommendation for using USDA pressure processes for low-acid foods is to use a canner that holds at least four ( 4 ) quart-size jars . The research for USDA pressure processes for vegetable and meat products was conducted in pressure canners that are most similar to today 's 16-quart or larger pressure canners. < br />< br />&# 34 ; Pressure cookers have less metal , are smaller in diameter , and will use less water than pressure canners . The result is that the time it takes a canner to come up to processing pressure ( that is , the come-up time ) and the time it takes the canner to cool naturally down to0 pounds pressure at the end of the process ( known as the cool-down time ) will be less than for the standard pressure canner . The come-up and cool-down times are part of the total processing heat that was used to establish USDA process times for low-acid foods . If the heat from the come-up and cool-down periods is reduced because these times are shortened , then the heat from the process time at pressure alone may not be enough to destroy targeted microorganisms for safety . That is , the food may end up underprocessed . Underprocessed low-acid canned foods are unsafe and can result in foodborne illness , including botulism poisoning , if consumed. &# 34 ;< br />< br /> Have fun , eat well , but do n't believe everything the infomercials say . They lie like politicians .#### #### ####[([171], [169], 'POS'), ([174], [169], 'POS')]
As a homebrewer who stores all finished beer in kegs , I 've been using the CarbaCap ( or it 's predecessor ) for years . It 's an ideal way to bring homebrew to club meetings and social outings with a minimum of hassle . I also use the CarbaCap to force carbonate unfinished beer so that I can get an idea of how the CO2 will alter the beer 's characteristics and then appropriately adjust / blend ingredients . It 's also the easiest way to make soda and other carbonated beverages at home ( though you 'll need to buy CO2 cartridges or a tank as well as several other fittings ).< br />< br /> The product works just as it should . If you 've worked with kegs before , you 'll understand the simplicity of the disconnect . I did have one &# 34 ; Carbonater &# 34 ; Cap ( an earler version of the product ) that I used for a few years , but it developed a crack upon the manufacturing seam and would no longer hold pressure . I lived without it for several years , but then decided to buy a replacement . Upon opening the package , I saw the Warranty statement , so I decided to contact the company to see if they 'd replace my old one . They quickly answered &# 34 ; yes &# 34 ; and sent me a replacement . That 's about as good as customer service gets !#### #### ####[([35], [38], 'POS'), ([16], [6], 'POS')]

This product was a great idea just poor execution and design . The coasters are nice , they are ceramic tile front with a cork bottom . The image quality is decent but as other reviewers have mentioned they can smudge they lack crispness in the printing process . My main problem with these coasters is that they do n't really serve their purpose . Coasters should prevent water from you glass from getting on your expensive furniture . Because these coasters are ceramic tiles the water just flows from the glass to the tile to the furniture . They lack absorption qualities which leads to you ending up having to wipe them off before putting them away or spilling water remnants after you pick them up . We ended up just turning them upside down so that the cork backing is up . This gets rid of the water problem but we lose seeing the images . I would think twice before dropping money on these .#### #### ####[([54], [50], 'NEU'), ([24], [19], 'NEU'), ([84], [76], 'NEU'), ([84], [83], 'NEU'), ([29], [34], 'NEU')]
This is a good pan . I purchased two 6 inch pans specifically for the purpose of baking round sourdough bread loaves or boules . The pan gives the loaf the structure it needs to rise up , rather than out and lets me divide my recipe into two loaves of a smaller size which is more in line with my bread use . I oil the pans lightly with coconut oil before putting in the dough to rise overnight and they slip out perfectly after baking . The pans clean up easily with a little soap on a sponge . Just use normal precautions as you would with any &# 34 ; non-stick &# 34 ; finished pan .#### #### ####[([104], [103], 'POS'), ([49], [52], 'POS')]

I just received the basket in the mail today . First off i want to say the craftsmanship on the basket itself seems very well done . The leather straps and metal chain that hold it together give it a very nice feel in person . Now on to the silverware included in the basket . The forks , knives , and spoons all are up to par with what someone would be looking for if they want to set up a romantic date in a park or something . The reason I 'm giving the basket a 3 stars out of 5 is because the plates I received were a different shape than the picture ( round not square so they fit slightly more snug in the straps but still work ) and for the normal 100 $ price tag the plates are very cheap feeling and will i feel most likely be scratched after a few times of being used . The wine glasses were the biggest let down because i feel with ( besides the plates ) everything else being of such high quality ill have to look for replacements for the acrylic stock models . They sort of remind me of the glasses you would buy in a party store that come in two parts . Overall I would recommend someone buy this basket if they want a really well crafted basket with all the straps for nice plates and glasses and does n't mind either buying new ones that will fit or using slightly less fancy ( but more durable ) plastic stock tableware . I 'll update this review after I use it for the first time if anything changes !#### #### ####[([115], [111], 'NEU'), ([178], [185], 'NEU'), ([112], [111], 'NEU')]

I got this for my father , who happens to have a beer bottle and can collection and prides himself on not drinking the same beer twice . We have a saying ' It 's beer thirty somewhere ' so I thought this range was pretty witty and fit him well , especially since all of his kitchen appliances are stainless steel. < br />< br /> The included screws require some extra tightening and tension as they are on the small side for the large mount holes - in the end we 're going to use our own hardware. < br />< br /> Regarding size , a lot of beer is consumed in his house , and this will likely fill up after one social gathering , but is still a nice , convenient way to store all those bottle caps ( which he keeps separately with his bottle / can collection . ) Personally , I 'm pretty excited I wo n't be seeing stray bottle caps all over the kitchen anymore and , for someone who is a beer aficionado , he is quite particular about his display - this will really be a nice touch to his man , erm , man kitchen ? Yes , it would be nice to have it a tad larger , but then it would n't really be so compact to stash under the wall mount bottle opener , so it 's a trade off in my opinion. < br />< br /> We received a product discount in exchange for our honest opinions , which we have provided .#### #### ####[([153], [161], 'POS'), ([199], [198], 'POS'), ([127], [135], 'POS'), ([73], [72], 'POS'), ([116], [126], 'POS')]

After going on a trip to Europe my husband and I were trying to figure out why their coffee always tasted so good . After much research i found out there are a few important items : 1 ) fresh beans , correct water temp , and use the pour over method . The Kalita Wave Dripper with its interior ridges helps to slow down the water filtering down into your cup . By slowing down the water the end product is a stronger more flavorful cup of coffee . I do recommend using a cloth coffee filter as this helps remove the oils that make coffee bitter#### #### ####[([40], [33], 'POS')]

I love this blender ! I 've been using it primarily to make smoothies / juices for summer ( went on health cleanse ) and for the price and functions of this blender , it 's absolutely worth it . The top is plastic ( so use a sponge to clean that part because a metal scrubber will leave marks ) , but the container itself is more glass-like than plastic , which is a big plus , especially if you multi-task with a blender and a processor. < br />< br /> The only issue I have with this is the extremely short extension cord . Oh , why are you so short in length ? !#### #### ####[([70], [68], 'NEU'), ([27], [37], 'NEU'), ([95], [94], 'NEU'), ([115], [113], 'NEU')]

This is a great product . So easy to use . Made beef jerky and it was ready in 4 hours . The key is to slice the meat very thin . Easy clean up .

Fast Shipping , This Madeleine pan is perfect for making the standard recipe size . The finished cookies came off with no problems . I followed a recipe from a cookbook called On Baking . The recipe calls to let the dough chill for 1 hour before baking to get the &# 34 ; HUMP &# 34 ; in the back of the cookie . Also I used cake flour . Such a great addition to my baking pan collection .#### #### ####[([17], [7], 'POS'), ([17], [16], 'POS'), ([63], [73], 'POS')]

This wacky thing is great . I make my bread from scratch and find that , once I get to adding those last few cups of flour , my hand is burning . I have arthritis in my hands and was n't having any luck finding a spoon that would work for me . Since you can grip this at any place and turn it in any direction , I found it to be much more useful since my hand was n't constantly locked in the same position . Even if I did n't have the arthritis issue , I 'd still recommend it , dough does n't gunk all up on like it does on a spoon . Very handy !#### #### ####[([24], [23], 'POS'), ([2], [1], 'POS')]
They are true to size . The bags worked for what I wanted them for . I used them to hold a medium sized stamp and ink pad . They were thin and very see through . You could see exactly what was in the bag and read the print on what was inside . When I stamped the front with ink dye , I was afraid that it would bleed through to the other side . It did not bleed through ; however , I was cautious in only using a small amount of ink on the stamp . I did not care for the strings , I felt that they were too thin , like a thicker sewing thread . Overall , they were not the best , but it worked .#### #### ####[([93], [92], 'NEU'), ([7], [2], 'NEU'), ([119], [128], 'NEU')]

I read the reviews and despite the warning that the glasses were coming in broken I rolled the dice and bought it anyways . It arrived with one broken glass .

love love love this thing ! I 'm not huge on cooking but this device is the greatest invention ever !

I have it going almost every other day of the week . I make a big batch of my favorite recipes and then I freeze the left overs for future meals . I did not used to cook this often or this much , but the ease and financial benefit of making bigger meals to use up fresh produce before it turns makes it so much better in our food budget . I found especially it makes it easier to make big batches of beans , which a huge budget stretcher ! Add a ham bone in there or a bit of bacon and you have flavor to savor ! Best gift I ever got .

When they say this thermos keeps your hot liquids hot , they mean it . It keeps them H O T ! I actually have to leave the lid off mine for a little while because I am sensitive to really hot things , so I like to let it sit for a bit . Even with the lid off , in my air conditioned house , it stayed right at the upper temperature of drinkable for me for hours . Although the drinking lip is slightly awkward at first with the button to open the lid right under your lip , I found that I was able to get used to it after the first day . The pros of this thermos far outway that slight con . I have the worst cup holders ( possibly in the history of all vehicles !) and I love that I can close this and lock it . When I go around a corner , or stop , or anything pretty much besides drive in a straight line going 15 mph , I know that when it gets tossed onto the floor and rolls under the seat it wo n't leak all over everything . The 16 oz capacity is perfect for me , since I usually drink strong black tea out of it . Anything larger and I would n't be able to fill it all the way without it becoming too weak . I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review , which I have given here . I would definitely purchase another one of these at full price , and I might have to if my husband figures out how great it is ;)#### #### ####[([142], [132], 'POS'), ([119], [126], 'POS'), ([276], [275], 'POS'), ([79], [87], 'POS'), ([92], [87], 'POS')]
Somehow I seem to have purchased hundreds of coasters in my time ( has n't everybody , right ?) . I bought cheap themed laminated cardboard ones that glass sticks to due to the condensation , glass ones that was like leaving a portable table ring , mirrored ones that mocked me as I drank , thin wood ones that warp , deep wood ones that my father-in-law constantly misses and drops drink all over table and floor , expensive stone and marble ones that crack when dropped or when guest slams glass on them like they reverted back to medieval times , took a rough tequila shot or thought they were at Putin 's house for a vodka party . Then I discovered Bamboo weave . Probably was used since the Shang Dynasty but I digress ... I have discovered a new world of the perfect decorative problem and ring free coaster . One less stressor in my life . I can finally drink in peace and tranqualty like I deserve .#### #### ####[([152], [142], 'POS'), ([83], [79], 'POS'), ([37], [43], 'POS'), ([15], [17], 'POS'), ([67], [62], 'POS')]

Have been using it for about 4 weeks now . Most of the reviews here are right & why I chose it . This larger waffle iron ( a huge reason for me choosing this !) cuts my time in 1 / 2 compared to my prior one . It 's true , when u find the right temp → waffles are perfectly cooked & better than any prior waffle iron I 've used . Yes , the outside of the iron gets really hot , but come on ... do n't most of them ? The consistency of the waffle is the most important winner here - wow ... honestly cooked just right when the green &# 34 ; ready &# 34 ; light comes on . I make gluten-free waffles , & this Proctor Silex 's little sliding scale for the temperature is nice ... and while it 's just a slider w / no numeric marking , if temperature slider was marked 1-5 ( it 's not ) , I 'd keep the heat settings at about a &# 34 ; 2 &# 34 ; , as the iron will make very dark waffles if the heat is too high , fyi . Mine is a new , but a cosmetically damaged Proctor Silex waffle iron for $ 10 less . The front-top plastic above the clip was chipped , and the silvery top had a gouge in it - so it was dropped or something obviously dropped on it ( gulp ) . Nevertheless , it all works great and I 'm very happy .#### #### ####[([140], [130], 'POS'), ([70], [65], 'POS')]

Updated review :< br /> Well , not even 2 years later , I 've had to change my rating for these containers . They started off working really well , but the difficulty with getting the lids off ended up being their downfall . After a few months of constant use , big pieces of plastic would break off from the corners or sides of the containers , I presume from the strain against the lids , rendering the containers ultimately useless because there was n't a leak-proof seal anymore . I no longer have any of these , as all of them ended up breaking in the same fashion and had to be thrown out. < br />< br /> Original review :< br /> Great for my needs , I use them every day to store pre-made meals in the fridge and in the freezer . They 're the perfect portion size for my lunches at work and seal very tightly . It 's a little difficult to get the lids off , which can sometimes be frustrating , but the benefits outweigh that one tiny annoyance . I have a lot of tupperware and glad reusable storage containers , but I end up using these the most because I love to make spicy stews and marinara-based pasta dishes , and these containers do n't get that stain that clear plastic does when faced with heat and red sauces . For that alone , these containers were totally worth the purchase . Plus , they send you two extra containers - gotta love that service !#### #### ####[([43], [50], 'NEU'), ([143], [152], 'NEU')]

I really think these make better ice cubes than conventional trays ! It can be a little tricky getting used to this type . You have to push on the bottom with your thumb to extract each cube . It 's best not to fill completely to the top . And since they are soft , it 's a little harder to carry without spilling . But they come out perfect and there is no wasted little pieces of ice . I 've heard if you boil the water they will be perfectly clear . If you tend to be a little lazy , one more benefit is that you can take a few cubes and leave the rest for later without having to empty the whole tray#### #### ####[([6], [5], 'POS')]

Required modifications to even work right .

We do still use it and the ice cream is great , but would just buy the Cuisinart if I had it to do over again .

Used this twice so far . Love it . And the ring has n't broken ( yet -- knock on wood ) .

I paid something like $ 600 for the prior model . Lasted about 4 years until the keypad ceased functioning . The failure of course was outside of the warranty period . Called GE ; they wanted me to sit in front of microwave with operator and press various buttons to confirm the keypad did n't work . Not a good use of my or anyone else 's time . The cost of repair is more than new quality microwave from some other company . Also , although they still function , our Cafe refrigerator and dishwasher are substandard and I will replace with some other brand as soon as something more than minor goes wrong . No complaints about the gas oven .#### #### ####[([110], [113], 'NEG'), ([71], [75], 'NEG'), ([45], [48], 'NEG')]
I purchased quantity 2 of these . My family and I went to the California State Fair here in Sacramento , CA where we live .

My mother had a steam juicer in the 1950 's , which she gave to me in the 1980 's . It was an aluminum one that was made , in all places , East Germany . It was a workhorse . I used it until a couple of years ago when it got to the point that the bottom was so thin I was afraid it would spring a leak. < br />< br /> I replaced it two years ago with this model of juicer which is made in Finland . It is an excellent juicer . However , it is of poor quality stainless steel . Although it does a great job , the inside of the bottom layer is already corroded . Also , it is impossible to polish out any of the many marks on the outside of the unit when using a cloth that is especially for stainless steel. < br />< br /> I would highly recommend buying a steam juicer but NOT this model . Too bad .#### #### ####[([107], [113], 'NEU'), ([97], [104], 'NEU'), ([105], [96], 'NEU'), ([105], [113], 'NEU')]
I never knew how much fun and how much easier it is to make stir-fry and other dishes . Seasoning the pan was super easy and it cooks so very well .

I was very excited to get this item . I drink a lot of green tea throughout the day . I have always had trouble finding a hot tea holder that will keep it hot for a long time . I have purchased cups that even plug into my car charger but once you get out of your car it gets cold . Here are my pros and cons to this item Pros - I love the color and shape . - It fits well in my car cup holder , - It does not get hot on the outside where you carry it . - I filled it with 2 cups of my tea and it fit . - 2 hours later my tea was still hot . - it has a lid that is a cup if you would like to pour it out . I have attached pictures of all the pieces . - it closes shut with the buttons on top so it stays hot and wo n't splash . CONS - there really is n't one . I did receive this product at a discounted price for my honest review . I would recommend this product to anyone that drinks cold or hot beverages and would like the temperature to stay .#### #### ####[([202], [207], 'POS'), ([18], [27], 'POS'), ([190], [193], 'POS')]
I have to say I love the Keurig coffee machines , but honestly I miss my first one . I up graded and gave my old one to my sister . What a mistake , first I truly hate the fact that I ca n't use all my K cups and I only have 4 cup size options verse my 5 . I have to open and shut it twice for every cup . Plus I ca n't change the water temp for the kids . I 'm really disappointed and asked my sister to trade me back my old one . Hopefully you come up with a new one with some of the old features . Thank you#### #### ####[([115], [114], 'NEG')]

I have 4 of their bottles already , so I am clearly happy with their products . All of them are easily my favorite insulated bottles. < br />< br /> Zojirushi has this secret process that allows them to make their wall gap super thin and yet add a layer of high quality plastic to the beverage lining . This keeps the beverage inside more isulated than my Thermos and makes it 100 % easier to clean . This is the best 1L insulated bottle I have owned . The thin wall gap is great because it keep the overall size down considerably . This one liter bottle would be a beast if not for that . ( also keep in mind that his model has a neoprene &# 34 ; Slip case &# 34 ; that adds bulk as well - but is much easier to hold. < br />< br /> This is an extremely high quality product . I would say on par construction wise with Thermos but the design is very Japanese - well thought out and details like the slip cover , have perfect stitching etc. . I am not sure if Thermos offered this slip cover they would do such a perfect job . if you are familiar with Zojirushi , you already know this . If you are not , I suggest you take the factory tour on youtube and compare to the Thermos tour . You ca n't make a bottle this good without really caring about what you are doing . I am not saying Thermos does not make great product , because they do , it 's just Zojirushi seems to really care about every detail . There seems to be more thought . For instance , when my best Thermos is sitting for a while with a cold beverage , the top will not open when I press the button - there is some negative pressure that all bottles have . The Zojirush has the same pressure problem , but they fixed it and the bottle always opens up . Small details. < br />< br /> Note : This IS 100 % a Japanese import , even though this is not made in Japan . The packaging and design are clearly intended for the Japanese market , so this model is not sold in the US . That could be why the quality is so high ? ? ( my other bottles are Japanese imports so I ca n't compare to US models )< br />< br /> This world market is the best part of Amazon !! !#### #### ####[([265], [269], 'POS'), ([159], [158], 'POS'), ([201], [208], 'POS')]

These are great ... however I ordered these to use as chocolate molds ...

I 've owned many garlic presses before . All of them required peeling the garlic cloves before pressing and usually they ended up breaking before too long .

I really like the idea of this product because you almost always need water when you take your pills / supplements and it has a great appearance . The pictures show multiple pills in each daily pill section . However , unless you have very small pills you wo n't be able to fit many in each section . I can fit 2 cinnamon capsules in Monday-Saturday . Sunday is a smaller section then the rest of the week ( i guess you are n't supposed to take as much medicine / supplements on Sunday ) . The lid of the containers also do not close tightly , so if you try to over fill the containers they will pop open and pills will fall out. < br /> I really like the bottle . The mouth of the bottle is large and nice for getting a good drink to wash down your medicine . The lid also has a flat top and acts as a cup to pour your water into as well. < br /> If the pill container was a little larger with better construction this product would easily be a 5 star product . That being said , it is just a cute water bottle that stays in my bathroom and I still have to have my supplement bottles on the counter with it as it only fits one does of 1 supplement in each section .#### #### ####[([187], [186], 'NEU'), ([26], [25], 'NEU'), ([180], [183], 'NEU'), ([36], [35], 'NEU'), ([32], [25], 'NEU')]

I thankfully have n't had any rusting issues with the scissors and , after 2 years of moderate use , they seem to still be pretty sharp. < br />< br /> My issue with them is that the soft rubber portion of the handles seem to be melting and disintegrating . If I push on that area , it deforms the rubber and a bit comes of on my finger almost like tar ( it 's the black stuff on my thumb in the pic ) . It 's also stripping off in that area in chunks . It almost seems like some kind of a chemical reaction with something , but I 'm not sure what . I also just noticed it 's only on one of the handles ; the other is completely fine. < br />< br /> I ordered these just over 2 years ago from Amazon , so I guess that 's a fair amount of use for the price .#### #### ####[([165], [159], 'NEU')]

I 'm absolutely thrilled with the product and Hummingbird 's customer service ! I received my package within one business day . I ca n't even tell you the love and care that went into this packaging . The box was secured w / a beautiful sticker , each straw was individually wrapped in tissue paper . Little details like that make a HUGE difference in my overall customer experience . The straws are made from thick , durable , quality glass ( I was afraid they might be flimsy and could break easily -- nope , these are great ) . I 've turned my family and friends onto these glass straws . Since using them to drink warm lemon & cayenne water in the morning , I have n't had any issues with gum sensitivity.This is coming from someone who has n't been able to drink warm lemon water in years -- drinking without a straw causes gum pain within a few hours . I did n't want to put a plastic straw in warm water ( or drink from a plastic straw at all , really ) . So happy I discovered these glass straws . Highly recommended . I 'll most likely be ordering more . With the holidays in a few months , I 'll probably purchase a few packages as &# 34 ; stocking stuffers &# 34 ; . :)#### #### ####[([46], [45], 'POS'), ([81], [78], 'POS'), ([64], [63], 'POS'), ([140], [148], 'POS'), ([157], [148], 'POS')]

I know know if it 's a woman thing , or if I 'm just odd and happen to be a woman too . But , I love colors . I love &# 34 ; cute &# 34 ; things . So , even though I bought this for my 11 yr. old grandson who 's the pizza guy in our home , ( and , by the way , he 'd picked out a black , cheaper by a couple of dollars version pizza cutter wheel ) , I went with this one because of the cool red handle with black accents and the rounder , sturdier looking handle . Well , when I got the thing , I was elated . The handle is perfect for holding in your hand . I have arthritis in both wrists , so holding a knife , or those thinner handles hurt like heck . But this is great even for me . I can press down with minimal pressure and no pain . And , my grandson 's slightly smaller hands fit great . Also , a grown man 's hands would fit . I guess I 'm trying to say this Kitchen Monster works great for anyone . Everyone ! The plastic pieces seem very sturdy and the wheel seems easy to clean . I ca n't wait for my grandson to get home from school so he can pop in a pizza and try it out .#### #### ####[([22], [29], 'POS'), ([224], [215], 'POS')]

Makes the coffee taste better than you can get with a paper filter . This thin micro-perforated design is much smarter than the mesh ones with a containing collar . The GoldTone is really thin and fits easily into the Aeropress filter holder . Coffee tastes better and is easier to press with the GoldTone .

So , this is my first mandoline chopper . I was surprised by how large it was . It has a large footprint so keep this in mind if you do n’t have a lot of extra kitchen space. < br /> It was absolutely great for slicing . I used it to slice zucchini and nectarines for a salad . The slices were thin and perfect , something I could never had achieved with a knife . There are three different slicer inserts , so you can do various thickness with ease . I used the julienne blades for onions and carrots . It may just be a matter of skill and getting used to the device , but I thought my carrots came out looking more shredded than julienned . If you are wondering the difference , for me I just felt like the carrots lacked a smooth and finished look . They were more messy. < br /> Overall , I ’m happy with the slicer and I ’m sure my skill with it will improve with time. < br /> Customer Review of Discounted Product#### #### ####[([59], [66], 'POS'), ([152], [157], 'POS'), ([146], [149], 'POS'), ([117], [114], 'POS')]

The lunchbox really works to keep door cool , even when not freezing . It is well made . Be aware that the bag is barely big enough for a sandwich and juice box . I 've also included chips , but they barely fit . I have to be very efficient packing it , because the sandwich tends to smash and the chips crush . There is no room for a fruit cup . I 'm not sure how it would work frozen because I 've been concerned that if I freeze it , there wo n't be enough room . After using this for a month , I 'm going to buy the bigger one .#### #### ####[([72], [78], 'POS'), ([33], [26], 'POS'), ([69], [78], 'POS')]

I have only used this colander a few times but its exactly what I was hoping for . It 's well built , a good size for everyday kitchen needs , and performs well .

Great design , and looks / feels very sturdy . Absolutely fantastic piece to sit in the middle of a table and the handle is well positioned so that carrying does not feel like it ' leans' ( as you 'd feel if you held a mug by its handle ).< br />< br /> The only complaint I have is that the lip of the pouring point causes liquid to dribble down the neck no matter how careful you are . Specifically , when you are done pouring and you tilt back up , the last strands of liquid slip over the edge but stick to the carafe and drip down on the outside . I even tried the ' lift-and-twist ' movement you do when pouring wine to avoid the dribble , but that did not work . The first time I used this I ended up with a bunch of red rings from wine . I 'm going to keep experimenting with pours , but I think there is just not enough concavity on the pouring point. < br />< br /> Other than this issue , I am very happy with this carafe . It looks fantastic .#### #### ####[([20], [11], 'POS'), ([17], [11], 'POS')]

First one caveat - I purchased this fry pan in 2014 and had been using it , but was offered another pan in 2015 free of cost by the seller , requesting a review . I have been using both pans now for about 6 months , and this review is my personal and honest opinion. < br /> So what 's good about the pan - one , it is non-stick and has kept being so even after about 6 months of regular use . And two , i like the red color . So I definitely recommend this pan for anyone looking for a stylish non-stick fry pan. < br /> What 's not so good - I realized soon after buying the pan that it is meant for gas stoves , not electric . Now , I have an electric range and because of the circular metal patterns on the bottom of the pan , you can scratch the stove top if you are not careful . I still continue to use it with my electric range , however , I am careful not to move the pan carelessly ... I also see that those circular patterns at the bottom have become somewhat discolored after use , but I do n't find that to be a big deal. < br /> Final say : Stylish and non-stick that continues to be non-stick , and therefore seems like a great buy for gas stoves ; in case of electric range , note that this pan can scratch the glass top if you are not careful .#### #### ####[([261], [266], 'POS'), ([102], [107], 'POS'), ([242], [234], 'POS'), ([109], [107], 'POS'), ([244], [234], 'POS')]

Problem solved cheaper than total Thermos replacements. < br />< br /> Our kiddo has two Thermos Funtainers but had managed to bite holes towards the end of the straws . I tried to solve the problem by snipping the top quarter inch of the straw off to rid the hole bites . But then bigger problem ensued . The Funtainers then leaked because the straw was then too short for the mechanism which makes the Thermos leak proof. < br />< br /> These replacements were ~$ 15 for TWO sets of straws and inserts . Which is cheaper than spending about $ 30 on total replacements so I consider this a good deal , especially because toddler is now beyond the straw biting phase. < br />< br /> NOTE : I am not CERTAIN this product by the actual Thermos company . Some of the graphics and fonts look &# 34 ; cheap &# 34 ; - like a knock-off poser company . But it does not change the fact that the parts fit and the Thermos Funtainers are once again leak proof . Which is the goal . It states made in China but I suspect that would be the case regardless if it is truly manufactured by the Thermos company or not .#### #### ####[([76], [69], 'NEU'), ([0], [2], 'NEU'), ([114], [113], 'NEU')]

most convenient cold brew device out there . i previously had the bruer which was a beautiful device . however , it would only make small batches and you had to wash each part by hand . when my chopping board fell over , my bruer shattered into a million pieces on the kitchen floor . at this point i decided to buy the OXO cold brew coffee maker . not only was it cheaper , but it makes bigger batch sizes and is very easy to wash . i 've even used the dishwasher . there is no need for replaceable parts if you are using the metal filter . there is an optional disposable paper filter that can be added but i find the metal filter is sufficient . there is very little coffee ground residue going through . i can make a whole week 's batch of cold brew at a time . the bottom plastic stand can be inverted for easy storage as well though mine never leaves the countertop . the switch also auto shut off when removing the glass flask below#### #### ####[([35], [25], 'POS'), ([154], [150], 'POS')]

Been searching for a ceramic burr mill for a while and thought I finally found one . I do not recommend this product because it still needs major improvements to parts . I have not even fully finished using it for the first time when the plastic parts on the inside all gave out . I was only able to mill 1 / 4 of my beans . A mill like this should really have all metal parts for durability . Definitely not a premium quality if plastic is still used . Premium I feel is all metal parts and works very smoothly .#### #### ####[([30], [27], 'NEG'), ([9], [4], 'NEG'), ([22], [27], 'NEG'), ([6], [4], 'NEG')]

This filter clearly makes a difference in the taste of my water . I have taken the liberty of getting a few measurements of the water before and after treatment so we can see how much of a difference it makes for TDP and PH , but keep in mind that these are simply tools to help define water quality but do not by themselves determine the overall quality of your water. < br />< br /> TDP :< br /> Tap - 186ppm < br /> Mavea - 125ppm < br />< br /> So here we see a drop of about 60ppm of TDP . Keep in mind that some TDP is not necessarily a bad thing . There are normal healthy particles and minerals that exist in water and are good for you . The goal is to remove the bad TDP and leave the good TDP . RO systems can reach a zero TDP by removing absolutely everything , but that does not necessarily make it better for you . To really find out more about the quality of your water you would need to know what particles exist in your water. < br />< br /> PH :< br /> Tap - 8.22 PH < br /> Mavea - 7.00 PH < br />< br /> Generally you want to be around an 8.0 PH , so the PH of my tap water is actually pretty good . The Mavea is still in a reasonable range , but did drop the PH a tad. < br />< br /> I did do a taste test , and while I can still taste some of the chemicals after the Mavea treatment , it does taste better than the default tap water . Overall I would say the Mavea filter has been a positive , and I do notice things like how much calcium / lime exists after boiling a pot of water with tap water vs Mavea water . I would say the Mavea pitcher is a solid choice at a reasonable cost and will improve your water , but given these results I suspect there may be better filter options out there , though I could not point you to any other specific brand at this time. < br />< br /> For those considering the ZeroWater pitcher for it 's zero TDP I would highly suggest reading the reviews . While I have not tested the ZeroWater pitcher personally , the reviews indicate that it turns your water very acidic within a matter of only 1-2 weeks giving it a horrible taste .#### #### ####[([29], [35], 'NEU'), ([17], [21], 'NEU'), ([29], [21], 'NEU'), ([138], [133], 'NEU'), ([68], [67], 'NEU')]

The paper cups were as described . They were small , but that 's what I was expecting : only a little smaller than a mini muffin cup . I used them to bake and serve cupcakes . I could bake a ton at one time , since I just had to line them up on a regular cookie sheet . I was making a layered cupcake , so the mix was sitting in the cup for a time before putting in the over , and I did not experience a soggy cup , or leaking , like other users have said . They baked great and stood up while decorating and serving . The only downside was not everyone remembered how to open these cups up to eat the cupcake . Most people ended up pushing the cake out . This is a great product , and worked well for my need , just keep in mind that they do n't peel down as easily as muffin liners if you are going to bake in them . You will probably have to demonstrate how to open them up. < br />< br /> Overall : I would buy again .

I am thrilled with this battery-operated pepper mill . I have a problem with chronic pain , and while I prefer fresh-ground pepper , it can be difficult for me to use hand-operated grinders which I have to repeatedly twist . With this mill , with the press of a button I can grind just the right amount . I love the transparent compartment for the pepper so you can see how much you have left. < br />< br /> A fun thing about this mill is the ability to create your own seasoning combinations of different kinds of peppers , salts , seeds , and herbs . I have several favorite combinations that I am always hand-grinding in a mortar and pestle , and now I can do it in this mill instead . I love it !#### #### ####[([113], [112], 'POS')]

Nice product from De'Longhi here , quality built . Looks and works like a professional grade machine. < br /> Very easy to use if you follow the instruction. < br /> Fill either the one cup , or two cup strainer with coffee , tamp it with the tamper for a nice even top , place it in the machine starting with the handle on the left and twist until the handle is facing middle. < br /> Turn on , wait for green light , dial the knob one more turn and voila , great Espresso. < br /> There are four settings - Steam , On , Make Coffee , and Make Coffee + Steam < br /> There is a nice large water reservoir that fits nicely inside , and a good trip tray that can be easily cleaned. < br /> The side steam swings out for frothing milk ( or whatever ) and the whole machine is pretty easy to use. < br />< br /> I have one problem , and for me it 's a big problem :-< br /> I 'm no Barista , so I 've never used professional Espresso machine . I 've seen plenty of course but never used one. < br /> I assume , because ( that 's what they do ) , they stop filling when the Espresso cup is full . This machine DOES NOT , and it 's a pain. < br /> Probably because I 'm used to pre measured quantities with Keurig K cups , or Tassimo pods , or even my Senseo bags - I sort of expected a decent Espresso machine to know how much 3-4oz was ??< br /> If you place your cup under the machine , and switch it to the little coffee cup sign , you will have to stand and watch it . Turn away and the cups overflowing , the drip trays filling up and it 's on a mission to empty the reservoir , shame really. < br />< br /> I had a couple of little hiccups too with the odd cup of coffee , at one point the machine made horrific noises and spewed water everywhere except through the coffee . I emptied the strainer and refilled and it worked fine , maybe a glitch. < br />< br /> Overall I gave it 4 stars#### #### ####[([127], [124], 'POS'), ([295], [305], 'POS')]

Got this oil-less fryer about a month ago , so far I 'm not that impressed , but in all fairness it does help &# 34 ; fry healthier french fries &# 34 ; .

These are great glasses that I 'm sure will get lots of use . My parents live in Florida and they 'll be a Christmas gift . I 'd give the 5 stars , except for the packaging is kind of cheesy and makes the glasses seem cheap . This of course does n't matter for personal use , but as a gift it does . These glasses are sturdy and will last . No worries about dropping them in the sink while washing them . Thanks for letting me try these out with a deep discount to review them .#### #### ####[([57], [47], 'POS'), ([86], [95], 'POS'), ([12], [2], 'POS'), ([3], [2], 'POS'), ([10], [2], 'POS')]
I used my Sushiquick Kit for the first time today and I love it ! I 've never attempted to make sushi before and I must say that the finished product looked very professional thanks to his kit ! First of all , the folding mat easily attaches to a base and the sheet of nori ( seaweed ) lays on the mat . I also purchased Kazu 100 % Organic Sushi Nori from Amazon . With a measurement of approximately 8.5 x 8.5 , the sheets perfectly fit on the folding mat . As an added bonus , a free lightweight bamboo mat was included in the package of 50 sheets ! Back to the sushi kit -- there is a plastic frame that is placed on top of the sheet of nori and this frame allows you to perfectly spread your rice and serves as a guide for the thickness of the rice layer . The included rice paddle makes this effortless . I found it even easier to moisten the paddle with some water while spreading the rice . There is an area at the top of the nori which will not be covered by the rice that will be dampened with water for sealing the sushi roll . After removing the frame , I added thin strips of carrots , cucumber and avocado on top of my brown rice and I was ready to roll ! The mat easily and neatly folds and seals the sushi roll and then there is a cutting guide that you place over the roll and expertly slice perfect portions ! It 's also helpful to dip your sharp knife in water while cutting each piece . There is a helpful instructional sheet enclosed with photos showing each step of using the Sushiquik Kit . If you 're interested in making your own healthy sushi at home and saving money as well , then I highly recommend that you purchase this kit !#### #### ####[([284], [277], 'POS'), ([302], [307], 'POS'), ([278], [273], 'POS'), ([154], [163], 'POS'), ([210], [219], 'POS')]

1st time French Press user and I am beyond satisfied . I looked up some videos on how to brew , pretty straight forward . Digging the dual-screen , have yet to come across any grounds in my cup . Highly recommended for beginners and experts alike. < br />< br /> Update : I still love this product , but the flask is too thin . Just cracked mine while washing it , I plan to replace , but a hint of advice is to wash this by itself , make sure there are no other dishes in the sink if you manual wash like I do . The glass cracks easily of you 're not careful , totally my fault , but I had to change to 4 stars since it 's still considered a flaw in my opinion .#### #### ####[([62], [65], 'POS'), ([4], [2], 'POS')]

There 's not much of a break room at my current job and I am not a big fan of having to microwave my mug until it ca n't be touched without a mitten when heating water for tea . This tea pot is small enough to keep out of the way on my desk or fit into a drawer . I also like that unlike some of the larger electric tea pots , there is no minimum , so I can heat up exactly 1 mug full of water and not have to empty the excess . I leave the pot open after each use .#### #### ####[([101], [102], 'POS'), ([7], [10], 'POS'), ([105], [102], 'POS')]
Got these to use while Kayak fishing . You do n't want glass when you 're kayaking and aluminum bottles are scary considering how much aluminum we already get every day , so this is the happy medium . Plus these are insulated ! They keep things cold after HOURS of being out in the heat with minimal covering . I keep mine in my tackle bag , with a flap over it to keep it out of the sun but that 's it . After 3-4 hours in the upper 80 's to around 90 , my &# 34 ; Ice 'd tea &# 34 ; was still pretty chilly. < br />< br /> Pros :< br />- Great for on the go type folks who need something to handle being smacked around. < br />- Keeps things fairly cool . Not as great as a Stanley thermos , but still good enough to last as long as it takes to drink it. < br />- Size is about the same as a regular bottle so no issues with it fitting in cup holders. < br />- Carabiner is good enough to rely on for the most part for strapping to a backpack or in my case : a tackle bag. < br />- Outer surface is AWESOME for those of us who kayak or have wet hands frequently . Keeps the bottle in your hand !< br />< br /> Cons :< br />- Does n't hold as much liquid as a regular bottle. < br />- It 's a little taller than regular metal bottles. < br />< br /> The cons are definitely minor . For my use I carry a cooler with the cold drinks on the back of my kayak and fill up these insulated bottles from there . They stay very cold over the couple hours it takes to down them and they stay cold enough for several hours after that. < br />< br /> Over all , I 'm * VERY * impressed . I will be buying more for sure if there are no other issues as I use them more .#### #### ####[([252], [251], 'POS'), ([46], [36], 'POS'), ([46], [47], 'POS')]

I purchased this product to replace a similar product . Both products are Waring brand fryers . My existing one did n't have a digital display or a timer . With this fryer the oil container is stainless steel ... the old one was porcelain and stainless I believe and had a &# 34 ; hook &# 34 ; upon which you can rest the basket while draining as well as after use . This one has no such hook and the basket must be hung on the side of the container ... DRIPPING OIL EVERYWHERE , also you ca n't put the lid on while draining or after use unless you submerge the basket in your oil . When I ordered this product I assumed it would be pretty much the same as my old one except with the digital temperature control and timer ... boy , was I ever mistaken !! !

My husband tends to be hard on thermometers . We have only had this for a couple of weeks but so far we love it .

I really wanted this to be the cool item of the summer BBQ season but sadly it did n't survive the first BBQ. < br /> And while I have no doubt that this digital thermometer would be fine for and baked item that can be safely removed from the over prior to checking the temp . Exposure to heat especially directly above or near any open flame seems to be the death knoll . After two uses the heat from my BBQ Grill melted the internal wiring and rendered the thermometer useless .#### #### ####[([87], [86], 'NEG'), ([13], [21], 'NEG')]

Terrific grinder that offers a very consistent , uniform grind . I had previously owned a Saeco espresso machine , so decided to choose this burr grinder . I was using a Cuisinart burr grinder that gave me poor quality grounds , with highly variable consistency -- Cuisinart grinders all seem to be the same basic design , and I was dissatisfied . This very good Saeco turned out to be just the right machine for me . I use very dark roast coffee beans that apparently cause some grinders trouble . Not this Saeco , it 's great .

The Froz Sphere Ice Ball Maker is very good . Now , I found a couple of tricks to fill it . First , use a measuring cup ( or some other device ) to initially fill the lower half with water . Set the upper part of the mold in place , making sure it sets down completely . Then , the easy way to finish filling the mold is to use a very small funnel ( I ’ve had mine for years but I think you can get one at a beauty supply store ) , placing the end into the hole but not shoved in all the way , i.e. leave enough room for air to escape . Pour more water through the funnel into each hold . After just a couple of fill sessions you ’ll get so you do n’t spill or over-fill them . Good luck !

We love these flexible little cups , I 'm just confused on the name ! I guess I should start by saying that I 'm not sure why they 're listed as bento dividers . I did try them just as the picture shows , and no matter what box I used them in everything fell out unless I held it completely flat at all times . Obviously that is n't going to work for a lunch box that gets put in a back pack . I tried every bento box and plastic lidded container that I have , so unless I 'm missing the 1 magic size that works .... things fall out of them if not held flat . They do make fabulous dividers for a home lunch though . The kids love using them at lunch , dinner and snack time. < br />< br /> Here are ways we 've used them :< br /> Ketchup , dressing , pancake syrup or BBQ sauce holder . These cups keep condiments from running into other foods on the plate. < br /> Portions : Make it very easy to see what a serving of an item should look like . Like nuts , cheese etc. < br /> Individual snack cups : to portion out candy to little ones so they do n't eat the whole bag. < br /> Muffin tins : bake cupcakes in them ! They are oven an dishwasher safe. < br />< br /> These flexible cups are multicolored , tear proof , easy to clean and the kids love using them . I really like using them and would definitely recommend them for stationary lunches. < br />< br /> I received this item free in exchange for my honest review .

delivered August 18th . produced about two dozen EXCELLENT cups of coffee , then ... NOTHING !!! ! just sits and spins . Not at all pleased . tried unplugging , changing water , nothing seems to do anything at all . Pretty lights , though . However , customer service is GREAT ! They stepped right up to trouble shoot , and then to deliver an overnight replacement . Now , for the rest of the story : The replacement that was sent to us overnight , worked for about another month , before the same problem developed . Needless to say , we were discouraged . I wrote a nastigram to the makers , and was rewarded almost immediately by a call from the INVENTOR ! He insisted that we would get to the bottom of the problem , and has since bent over backwards to satisfy us . No matter what else happened , this was service well beyond what one has come to expect in this country . I commend them , and more .#### #### ####[([97], [96], 'POS')]

Received mine on Saturday and followed the instructions to the letter . Attempt one resulted in half-cooked egg spilling over my counter . Raw egg seeped into the top english muffin , I suppose this is an attempt at a McGriddle ? Attempt two had the egg congealing more but it was nowhere near edible . Cleaning by hand is difficult . It takes three times the duration to make a breakfast sandwich and the results are only approaching that which normal folks would call food . It did n't actively harm me or seek my destruction so I award it 2 stars .#### #### ####[([30], [28], 'NEG')]

I always approach a new product ( for me ) as a loser . This one is a winner . I tried it out on a 1.75 liter bottle of wine upside down & sideways . There were no drips , After the silicone becomes wet from wine it still does not leak . What a great invention . I did n't need any monogramed sealers so this product was fine .

PolyScience has helped bring the tools of Modernist Cuisine into the kitchens of amateur chefs . Certainly , any home modernist aficionado has a sous vide cooker . The Smoking Gun is the next must have device for your arsenal . It can help infuse hearty and delicate foods with smoke flavor , and very quickly . You add the wood chips to the smoking chamber , turn on the Smoking Gun fan , ignite the chips with a kitchen lighter , and smoke will come pouring out of the tube. < br />< br /> Because the smoke is released rapidly , you need to be prepared to capture the smoke in whatever food you are flavoring - ice cream , soup , cocktails , meats , etc . Also , you want to be working with your kitchen hood on full force , or outside , or turn off your smoke detectors . It is worthwhile to watch some of the vides online to give you tips on how to handle and make the most of your Smoking Gun . Adding smoke flavor to almost any food is tremendously easy with the Smoking Gun. < br />< br /> Not only can you test the flavors of different wood types , but you can use , spices , teas , herbs , really anything that is dry and flammable to give a little a something unique to your foods . The Smoking Gun allows an almost unlimited amount of experimentation .#### #### ####[([249], [248], 'POS'), ([39], [47], 'POS'), ([218], [209], 'POS')]
Bought these to replace all the broken and chipped bowls from daily family use . I enjoy the assorted colors and feel they make breakfast and snack times a little cheerier .

With three kids who need to take treat bags to class as well as needing bags to hand out to our little relatives who stop by on Halloween for goodies , I am always on the hunt for cute , high quality treat bags that are n't going to immediately rip , in large quantities . When I found the listing for these orange and black spider bags with the clear web window , I knew that they would work out quite well for our needs ! Not only are there a lot of bags ( 192 ) , but these bags are high quality , made nicely and are n't going to just fall apart like bags I have purchased in the past. < br />< br /> These bags arrived SUPER quickly to my home , securely boxed and bagged . Immediately I was impressed by these bags , they are super adorable , nice quality and I absolutely adore the clear little window on the front to get a sneak peak at the treats as well as a super spooooky spiderweb ! I loaded these up with gumballs to test how much these could hold and how well they held up , and let me say , they held up very nicely and held quite a lot ! I was impressed ! The gumballs looked super neat viewing them through the little clear window . I am very pleased with my order and am glad to have been able to fulfill my need from the comfort of my living room as opposed to ever other year when I am running around panicking trying to find what I need ! !

First of all - this is truly a GREAT espresso machine :< br /> * The Espresso / crema quality is really awesome - you can use to make Latte , Cappuccino , Americano ...< br /> * The temperature of steam in the Milk want in the pretty hot and does not dilute the milk unlike Mr Coffee and other cheaper brands < br /> * No funny smells ( like Mr Coffee which gives a plastic smell for the first 3 months of use )< br /> * Two size espresso holder for 1 or 2 cups of coffee powder < br />< br /> Now the negatives I found is that it does not automatically stop after filling up 1 or 2 cups - which may not really be an issue , but a nice to have. < br />< br /> Overall - if you are considering a low priced espresso machine - I can tell you from my experience of using Mr Coffee for over 7 years - there is major difference in the quality of the espresso as well as the milk wand . Example : I am never able to get my Mr Coffee to heat milk to the right temperature. < br />< br /> So , this is worth every extra dollar you pay compared to a cheaper machine#### #### ####[([207], [217], 'POS')]

We had a mandolin slicer a few years ago , but got rid of it due to a dull blade and how annoying it was to wash . So I ’ve been hand slicing everything for the past couple year . I forgot how handy a slicer is ! Here are some thoughts on this :< br />< br />• Slicer design : When I first saw it I was n’t sure if I was going to like it because it does n’t have a stand , I have to hold it in my hand . I thought it might be difficult or annoying . I was surprised that it actually is n’t annoying at all . Even with my older slicer I had to stabilize it with my left hand anyway , so it ’s no different with this holding it with my left hand . The lack of a stand also makes it easier to clean. < br />• Slicing discs : I love the 4 discs that come with this . There are thin slices , thicker slices , French fries and shreds . They pop in and out of the slicer very easily and work extremely well . I personally really needed a slicer for my 1 ½ year old son . He only has 4 teeth and ca n’t eat firm fruits and veggies well . I love being able to slice produce in a variety of fun ways for him to eat ! This is perfect for us . I also am looking forward to making French fries with this . I have used my Paderno spiral slicer for shoe string fries and love it , but this will add some variety to my French fries and will make them easier to put on a baking sheet . The discs have a nice little holder that keeps them protected and keeps the blades at the bottom. < br />• Sharp : This is an incredibly sharp slicer . I had a very soft , nearly rotten peach that I wanted to test . I figured it would mush it up rather than slice it . Nope ! It came out in beautiful slices . Slicing harder items takes a little more push , but the blade is still plenty sharp to slice and cut it. < br />• Cleaning : I love that all of the pieces can go in the dishwasher and they are all flat so they do n’t take up much space at all . My last mandolin slicer had a big stand and took up a ton of space . For a kitchen gadget to get 5 stars from me it has to be : easy to use , functional , easy to clean and easy to store . I have a food processor attachment for my Kitchenaid mixer that does all of the things this mandolin slicer does , but it ’s HORRIBLE to clean and put away . We have it stored at the back of the pantry because we only use it for large quantities of food . It ’s not easy to clean or easy to store . I ’m grateful that I can use this mandolin slicer daily and it ’s not a big production. < br />• Safety : I ’m an ER nurse and if I got a dime for every person I ’ve got in that ’s cut off the tip of their finger with a slicer I would be retired . There ’s no way around it , these can be dangerous . I ’ve cut my finger , my husband ’s cut his finger , it happens . This one does come with a really , really effective piece for holding the fruit / veggie . I ’ve had some that do n’t actually hold the produce , they rip it and do n’t pull it through the slicer . This one has sharper prongs that pierce the produce fairly deeply to hold it in place . The green part of the holder can be lowered or raised to expose more of the prongs to pierce the product deeper if needed . This is the best holder I ’ve seen and if used right will protect the fingers well. < br />< br /> Overall , I have no hesitation giving this 5 stars . I love it , I love how easily it stores , I love how well it works and I love how it can go in the dishwasher . I was sent this to test and review . That never influences my review of products , I always give unbiased feedback. < br />< br /> We are obsessed with making healthier french fries with this slicer . I put some pics up . Here 's how I make them :< br />< br /> Preheat oven to 425 < br /> Slice up a potato with the thicker strip blade attachment < br /> Toss with olive oil and a pinch of salt < br /> Place on silicone baking mat , spread out so they are only one layer thin , not stacked < br /> I leave them in about 12 minutes , then toss them around , then every 6ish minutes I toss them around some more so they get evenly baked. < br />< br /> They are so delicious . You could add seasoning as well . I 've been meaning to use the smaller shred type blade to make hash browns , but have n't got around to it . Thanks for reading ! en meaning to use the smaller shred type blade to make hash browns , but have n't got around to it .

Our sweet well-mannered cat had turned into an incorrigible butter thief , and refused to mend his ways . The Buddah-Butta dish was a great find .

It was designed to hold water . They do not leak . As far as that is concerned they are great. < br />< br /> The silicone is more like a hard rubber compared to the other silicone ice cube trays I bought simultaneously . This makes removing the cubes a bit arduous , wetting the tray top or bottom does n't help much either . These are best for a party as one can easily remove all cubes on to a tray by hitting the bottom. < br />< br /> It 's too difficult to get just one cube at a time . That being said I 'd still recommend them , I am keeping mine , but I prefer the pair from home solutions better .#### #### ####[([38], [37], 'NEU')]

Hubby and I live in a condo and while the condo is quite large , the kitchen is not . It was one of those things that we were willing to sacrifice when we bought it . However , we have had to become creative in how we use the space !< br />< br /> All of our knives are packed like sardines in our tiny little silverwear drawer and about 70 % of the large knives we own do n't come with those nice plastic safety covers that ease your mind as you are digging around in the drawer . This knife holder sure has helped and given we have a bit of extra wall space I would LOVE another one to stick a few of our smaller knives on. < br />< br /> It was super easy to install ! Do n't miss the instructions though ! At first I thought it did n't come with instructions ( not the end of the world as if you have ever put up a large picture frame etc you will be familiar with the pieces ) , but then I realized the instructions were packed tight into the box that the holder comes in . It mounted in easily and feels sturdy ! I love that it is stainless steel and matches our appliances :- D < br />< br /> I definitely recommend this for any house with little ones around who may have arms long enough to reach inside a drawer or anyone with as bad of space issues as we have !!< br />< br /> I received product in exchange for my honest opinion .#### #### ####[([77], [85], 'POS'), ([77], [67], 'POS')]
After 1 year and 10 months the power level went south and now it cooks on high no matter what setting I pick . I did have the foresight to purchase a Square Trade 2-Year Appliance Protection Plan ($ 125 -$ 150 ) for under $ 9.00 and I just filed a claim which they accepted . I 'm going to buy another one and use the box to send back to my original one to Square Trade . I would highly recommend paying the extra $ 9.00 for the 2-Year Appliance Protection Plan !< br /> Update :< br /> I bought another one with another $ 9.00 Square Trade 2-Year Appliance Protection Plan. < br /> I used the box from the new one to pack the defective one and sent it back to Square Trade . Easy return , they provided me with a return UPS label that I printed out and UPS picked it the next day . I was surprised when I received a full credit the following day even before Square Trade received the defective unit !< br />< br /> BTW , The new one cost me $ 16.95 , less than the original one ............... In short pay the extra $ 9.00 for the 2-Year Appliance Protection Plan which is less than $ 0.38 a month !! !#### #### ####[([149], [159], 'POS')]

This BasicWu instant read thermometer was sent to me free of charge . I agreed to test it and write an unbiased review. < br />< br /> The first thing I noted when I looked over the thermometer is that there is no clip . It is also not a \\" continuously updating thermometer \\" . That means , you cannot leave this clipped to the side of your pot to monitor the temp of your food . A candy thermometer MUST be self-updating and it must be very accurate as the temps go from too low up to too high very quickly once the pot begins to boil . Soft boil , hard boil , crack , etc ... stages are critical to recipes . Experienced cooks know how to test for the right stages without the thermometer , but novice cooks do not. < br />< br /> It will not work for oil or any other product you are cooking on the stovetop that needs careful temp monitoring. < br />< br /> What this does work on , and what it works well on is checking the temp of entrees , tv dinners , meat , cheese making , pasteurizing milk , etc ... It takes a few seconds to register the temp but it is good at it . I checked it against my calibrated thermometer and found this one is accurate within a degree. < br />< br /> Please do not purchase this if you need a candy or oil thermometer , this is not what you need . If you need something to spot check , this is an inexpensive option to tell when your food is properly cooked .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'POS')]

I purchased one of these for my daughter and she absolutely loved it so I went ahead and bought one for myself , right out of the box water was leaking from the handle , going back immediately , I will not even give this another try as I have had problems with Bonavita products before and it 's not worth the aggravation . The following is from my past post on Bonivita &# 34 ; I did try the 1L size and loved it , but i had to return that item 4 times as the base unit kept getting error messages . Bonavita did reach out to me after I emailed them and I was told that there was a batch of base units that were defective , they offered to send me a new base unit but I declined as I gave up with the smaller model and purchased this larger one < br /> 5 stars to Bonavita customer service 1 star for the 1.7 Liter model#### #### ####[([149], [153], 'NEG'), ([162], [153], 'NEG')]

So this is another product I 've wanted for a long time , but after receiving and using it , I 'm not convinced I 'm doing it right . The juicer contains instructions on how to cut the fruit before placing it in the device , and I followed them , but I think I had a different picture on how this juicer would work. < br />< br /> Its performance for keeping seeds out of my food is excellent - nary a seed sneaked through the holes , but I feel like the lemon halves still have juice left in them . Of course if I try to squeeze it manually after using this juicer , the seeds absolutely pour into my food , so it 's not very practical . I have n't decided what I 'd rather do , use the juicer and get less juice , squeeze manually and get seeds , or kind myself another one of those tiny mesh / metal strainers and strain through that . I 've always heard that having kitchen gadgets that can only do one thing ( two in this case , if you count squeezing lemons and squeezing limes two different things ) is a bad idea , and I honestly think there may be some truth to that . If I was n't so particular about the juice yield on my lemons , I could see no fault in the product , so if you 're willing to sacrifice a little juice for zero seeds , this is your product. < br />< br /> I received this for free or at a discount for product testing and review . My review is not guaranteed positive , it is an accurate representation of my experience with the product .#### #### ####[([236], [229], 'POS'), ([79], [81], 'POS'), ([156], [165], 'POS'), ([283], [274], 'POS'), ([233], [229], 'POS')]

Great quality and sturdy plastic , they are washable or you can dispose if you choose . I do recommend it .#### #### ####[([120], [130], 'POS')]
Great product ! It 's the perfect size for me to handle with one hand and the mouth is just right to guzzle water without wearing half of it . I like drinking from glass rather than plastic and with the outside rubber it gives some protection from breaking as well as grip . I drink water rather than sip it and the mouth is the perfect size for me to get a mouthful . I thought that 20oz would be too small since I 'm used to my 40oz kanteen , although it 's been great for around the house where I can refill it easily or on short trips . Probably wo n't keep water cool like my kanteen does but it 's small enough I could put it in a small cooler if needed . The cap screws on and off easily and appears to have a nice tight seal .

Before you buy these things , you have to research the size thoroughly . I wanted this for a convection oven I bought . The stated sizes are sometimes just the size of the pan , or the finished &# 34 ; cake &# 34 ; size , or sometimes they tell you the size of the box that the product is in , which is totally useless to the buyer . On this broiler pan , the stated size does not include the insert , which sticks out considerably . However , I 'm going to keep this because it will work in my big oven . I took a star away for incomplete information . I ordered the smaller pan like this . Wish me luck. < br />< br /> Here are the sizes , measured exactly . If all products had this information , it would be very easy to fit them. < br /> The complete broiler pan at it 's widest outside measurements as shown in the photo : 17-3 / 4 &# 34 ; x 11-3 / 4 &# 34 ; x 2 &# 34 ;< br /> The pan alone , at it 's widest outside measurements : 16-1 / 4 &# 34 ; x 11-1 / 4 &# 34 ; x 2 &# 34 ;< br /> The inside of the top taper of the pan14-1 / 2 &# 34 ; x 10-1 / 4 &# 34 ;< br /> The inside of the bottom taper of the pan 13-3 / 4 &# 34 ; x 9-1 / 2 &# 34 ;< br />< br /> I hope this helps you .#### #### ####[([162], [167], 'POS'), ([31], [38], 'POS'), ([173], [166], 'POS'), ([74], [67], 'POS'), ([196], [203], 'POS')]

I was looking for a travel option and found this to be perfect . After I received it , I like the finer hole at the button so it brew a cleaner cup of coffee than french press option which was my other consideration . But then I just ca n't get pass below 2 issues and decided to return it. < br /> 1 . I wish the design is narrower . I just find holding it not comfortable . This is also a concern for cars that have smaller cup holder like other claimed . 2. This is the main issue I decided to return it after a couple try . The lid is made of silicon and you can taste it . It completely ruined the coffee and gave me concern about health issue . I guess in reality it is safe and the taste might fade after you drink from it after several cups of coffee . But I just got put off by this and do n't want to drink from it anymore. < br /> Hope they change the diameter / material used in the future because the coffee produced is better than french press option in my opinion so they got the basic right . But for a travel mug , people need to be able to hold it comfortably and certainly lid should n't add taste to the coffee .#### #### ####[([34], [36], 'NEG'), ([37], [36], 'NEG'), ([187], [197], 'NEG'), ([194], [199], 'NEG'), ([91], [94], 'NEG')]

Dislikes :< br /> The diffuser is too short . If you 're making one or two cups of tea you will not get a good steep . We took out the diffuser and just use the kettle to heat water. < br />< br /> Yes , it is programmable however , when heating less than a full kettle it will overshoot the desired water temp. by 10 - 15 degrees . I got around this problem by lowering the set point . If I want 175 deg water I set the program at 160 degrees . The problem with this work around is when I want to maintain the water temp at 175 , because the kettle will allow the water to cool to 160 before maintaining. < br />< br /> The base power connection to the kettle is a group of concentric raised rings that fits in the kettle 's concentric recessed circular grooves . When placing the kettle on the base I have to move the kettle around to get the two sets of rings to mesh . If I just set the kettle down on the base and do n't make the effort to properly seat it the kettle will not sit level , instead it will tilt at angle that is unsafe , especially when the kettle still has hot water in it . Other kettles Ihave used just have a simple post on the base that fits in a hole in the kettle bottom. < br />< br /> It is slow ! Compared to other electric kettles I 've used is is painfully slow . Also , the water will be at a full boil for a half minute or more before the kettle shuts off . If you remove the kettle before it shuts off and empty the kettle the program will resume heating even though there is no water . The kettle does have a dry pot safety shut off but it would be nicer when you are n't using the temperature program mode if it just turned off when you lifted the kettle. < br />< br /> Price . It is overpriced given the problems I 've encountered. < br />< br /> A small thing but still a thing ; the owner 's manual lists a desired water temp of 175 degrees for green teas . The program will only let you set the temp in 10 degree increments , 160 - 170 - 180 etc. < br />< br /> Another small thing ; push the lid release button and the lid only comes up half way . I also find the handle ergonomically awkward but it may be perfect for the average person. . It is heavy . If you have weak wrists you wo n't like the weight. < br />< br /> Likes :< br /> It looks good. < br />< br /> The beeper alert is not annoyingly loud .#### #### ####[([165], [156], 'NEU')]

I bought this for my daughter 's dorm box as she loves to cook and bake . I was pleasantly surprised to open the box and find everything individually wrapped and the sharp items not gouging other utensils or their way out of the box . The utensils are nicely balanced . A staple that is missing though , is a ladle , but that was easy enough to buy separately . Unlike many college students , she makes real mashed potatoes and strawberry shortcake , so I also added a masher to the box as well . I realize a masher is seldom used these days except perhaps for guacamole ( and we use a pastry blender for that ) and would n't call it ' essential ' like the other utensils that do come in the set . She was quite surprised to get such a nice set instead of my warped and melt-marked hand-me downs ! Now for a way to keep them out of the hands of her room mates ...< br /> I think I 'll be back for a set for myself :)#### #### ####[([81], [80], 'POS'), ([81], [73], 'POS'), ([74], [79], 'POS'), ([83], [80], 'POS'), ([149], [155], 'POS')]
ok for an outdoor picnic to keep bees and flies off - IF it is n't windy at all . Ultimately , however , I do n't recommend this product . Fruit flies ( or , as some refer to them , gnats ) can easily access the food both through the mesh itself and under the edges of the net which arc up slightly when the unit is opened taut . The collapsible feature is good for storage and I did use them on a camping trip to keep bees off of the sandwiches successfully . They will remain in the camping box , however , as they are useless for my intended purpose of keeping fruit flies off of the bounty of fresh fruit and veg that live on the kitchen counter - especially this time of year ! Remember : never refrigerate fresh tomatoes ! !#### #### ####[([78], [70], 'NEG'), ([78], [73], 'NEG')]

The greatest . I am using during Houston August hot spell . Have used inside and outside . At 1800 watts , it has the most power for a 130 v portable .

I 've been using the StarPack tongs for about two weeks and find them to be well made , easy to clean , do not scratch non-stick coatings and hold up well to high heat cooking . The only small issue I 've had is with the smaller of the two tongs opening fully only after manually forcing it to do so . I 've also been using the longer of the two tongs as my ' go to tool ' for when I need to put cups and glasses away on high shelves and do n't want to pull the kitchen stepstool out . The silicone ends have a great gripping ability and have worked well as an extension of my arm for those hard to reach spaces . When I was pricing similar tongs , you get two from StarPack for the price of one with other brands . I like these tongs , they do what they were designed to do and more .#### #### ####[([10], [19], 'POS'), ([40], [38], 'POS'), ([144], [148], 'POS'), ([40], [39], 'POS')]

[[ ASIN : B00MMQOZ1U SterlingPro Double Wall Stainless Steel French Coffee Press , 1 Liter ]]< br />< br /> This is my second French Press . The first was another manufacture 's product with a glass decanter . I decided to step up and purchase a brand with a steel container and a better plunging system . What a difference . The coffee stays warmer a lot longer and there are almost no grinds in my cup . Once cleaned the Sterling Pro stainless steel looks great on my counter top . Some of my recent guests after seeing the product and tasting the smoothness of the coffee are purchasing the product for their home . Sterling Pro in their literature recommends three minute brewing time , I prefer 4 and I allow the water to boil and than wait 15-20 seconds prior to pouring. < br /> All in all it is a great product .#### #### ####[([63], [65], 'POS'), ([77], [84], 'POS'), ([90], [96], 'POS'), ([91], [87], 'POS')]

I tried using this grinder for dry roasted almonds . The nuts did n't grind easily at all ... I had to fight with the handle to get it to turn ... after using it twice I decided to buy something else because I was either hurting my upper back or my thumbs , trying to get the handle to turn ( and had to keep shaking it to get the nuts to shift in order to get the handle to turn at all ) . The area where the top screws on to the bottom is very shallow ... part of the fight was just to keep the two parts together ... and the lid on top of the hopper was useless because it would fly off too easily. < br />< br /> Perhaps this would work OK for a very soft nut ... pistachios , maybe ?< br />< br /> It 's cute but very poorly designed .#### #### ####[([49], [48], 'NEG')]

In general I do not like Hamilton Beach products finding them somewhat low quality . I was very hesitant on buying it , but reading the reviews I decided to give it a try , especially considering Amazon 's great return policy. < br /> It makes a really full bodies coffee . With the same coffee beans , our old machine ( Mr coffee ) was not making nearly as bold as this one although we brewed both on bold setting. < br /> I do not know if I am lucky , or other reviewers are unlucky , but I did not have any spillage issues so far , neither leaks. < br /> If you are thinking of buying a cheaper product , I would definitely suggest buying this one instead . It does really produce much better tasting coffee . Since I have not tried $ 100 + machines , I have no idea how it would compare with them. < br /> Coffee does not have a burnt taste with this machine , even after 4 hours of keeping it warm. < br /> Note that the machine slides a bit if you do not hold it ( or put it next to wall ) and push the cup to fill. < br /> Machine makes a bit noise while keeping the coffee warm , but ou can only hear it while in kitchen . Not very noisy anyway. < br /> I wish the blue light on screen had a way to shut off , but even if there is a way I could not find it . If you are in a studio it might be an issue to have a bright blue light at night , but not a problem for us. < br /> In sum , If you are going to buy in this price range , or something cheaper , I would suggest giving this a shot. < br /> It is a bit bigger than regular coffee makers , so if the space is a big issue , you might consider it twice .#### #### ####[([284], [289], 'POS')]

I bought this dutch oven after reading from several customers that they use it for bread baking . This is exactly what I wanted it for as well . The books ask for a 4 quart dutch oven , but that does not seem to exist. < br />< br /> I had asked the question from others if I need to oil the pot prior to placing the dough inside . The reason I asked what that once before ( with a larger Dutch oven I own ) I had placed the dough inside the cold Dutch oven and let it rise before placing the vessel in the preheated oven . The bread was terrily stuck. < br />< br /> Once I read that the Dutch oven must be pre-heated and then the proofed loaf goes in the hot vessel the problem of sticking was solved . There is not sticking . And while the proofed loaf collapes somewhat during handling and transfering , it does rise nicely during baking . The crust is heavenly , similar to the breads I grew up with . YESSS !!!!!< br />< br /> This is a quality pot . Another reviewer mentioned the comfortable handles and large knob , an important factor when using heat safe gloves . This pots shines in all aspects . Well worth the money , I am thrilled with its performance .#### #### ####[([200], [203], 'POS'), ([219], [210], 'POS'), ([197], [206], 'POS'), ([143], [140], 'POS'), ([211], [210], 'POS')]

Mine finally stopped getting to the upper temp . I purchased it 22 months ago and got a 2 year warranty . Today I went to use it and it just did n't cook what I wanted . I thought maybe it was me . I tried again and a second time it did not cook correctly . I only used it about 15 times over the 22 months . I put a thermometer on it and it barely got to 400 and sat mostly at 350 . Previously it went over 450 with no issue . I also noticed the heating element was not a glowing orange during the second back. < br />< br /> If squaretrade wants to fix it , so be it .

This is a very nicely made , good quality manual pepper ( or salt ) mill . It is 9 inches in height by 3 inches width . It is made of stainless steel and has a window that shows me the contents of this mill . It is one of the easier mills that has a dial that I can use to choose the settings easily . I 've had other salt mills that I could n't tell which way to turn to choose coarse or fine . There 's just nothing worse than to chew on a big piece of a peppercorn . This is no nonsense : I just line the arrow up with the size of my choice , that 's it . It is easily cleaned with just regular dish soap and water and towel dry .

I started using the Contigo mugs about 2 years ago or so . I am an inveterate coffee drinker and enjoy sipping on a large cuppa for most of the morning . I grind my own beans and use a french press so need a container worthy of my brew and the Contigo is the only way to go . So , I was recently on a housewares shopping trip at Target and they had the new and updated Contigo mug . Considering that my current one is a bit chewed up from constant use and abuse I decided to treat myself to the new one and I am absolutely delighted. < br />< br /> Like the original Contigo the drip free drinking system is unparalleled . First , because of the simple design , drinking with the cup is very natural . No flipping of levers or weird positions to hold your hand . Your fingers naturally just press the button as you bring it to your coffee hole . And if the button is not pressed , you cannot spill your coffee . Really , you just ca n't . When I am asked about why I only drink from this mug I take a sip then flip the coffee cup over my head . Never a drop gets in my hair. < br />< br /> Now , the new design actually has a bit of a different curve to the spout and that makes drinking even more pleasurable . The new locking feature seems to be a bit of overkill to me but I could see it being useful if you are dropping this into your bag or something like that . The drink also seems to flow a bit more fully than in previous models. < br />< br /> The full seal along with a quality vacuum bottle keeps your drink warm for as long as possible . I usually pour my first cup at 6am and have been able to still drink it warm at lunch. < br />< br /> The best part is that they fixed the one complaint I had for the previous contigo which was access to the drinking mechanism for cleaning . You used to be able to get to it but only with a small brush . Now it is easy-peasy with full access from an easy to use mechanism. < br />< br /> Definitely get the brushed aluminum finish for a few extra bucks if you care what yourcup looks like . The matte finish ones will flake on the bottom after repeated cup holder insertion and removal. < br />< br /> So yes , pay the money for a coffee cup that you will be truly happy with . The first time a co-worker knocks your coffee cup over and the Contigo does n't let any drip out onto your shirt will save you the extra money you spent . If you are a daily coffee drinker , going back and forth to the office the contigo is a must buy .#### #### ####[([41], [40], 'POS')]

It 's great except it really is annoying and seemingly unnecessary to have to push a button every single time I want to drink out of it . Yes it 's easy but it 's still extremely irritating . I read other reviews about and thought , oh big deal , so i 'll just push a button . At least it wo n't spill . But , no , it 's not worth it . Also , even is you have it on the lock function , it will spill a little if it falls over or upside down . I have other thermoses that are n't as annoying to drink out of and you can turn those things upside down and sideways and they still wo n't spill.Don't bother with this one .#### #### ####[([16], [7], 'POS'), ([49], [41], 'POS'), ([19], [18], 'POS'), ([57], [48], 'POS'), ([49], [48], 'POS')]
This is a nice set . Both of the tools are brushed stainless steel . They have a good , solid feel to them and the handles are easy to grip . Both have sturdy hooks on the end to hang them and you really should . They 're too pretty to hide in a drawer. < br />< br /> The peeler is a design that 's new to me . It has a &# 34 ; shield &# 34 ; to deflect the peelings and it 's SHARP . The little slicer on the end is handy for removing potato eyes and other imperfections . I 've peeled potatoes and carrots and zuchinni with it and it does a fine job . Takes off the peel with very little waste. < br />< br /> The other implement is a &# 34 ; Julienne &# 34 ; slicer and it 's two sided . One side has finer teeth and the other has coarser teeth . You simply draw it down the side of the veggie ( a zuchinni , say ) and it quickly cuts it into strips . Now here 's an interesting thing and if you are scientifically trained , you may understand it . It has me puzzled . The blades on both sides are quite sharp , but the finer teeth produce a wide strip , while the coarser teeth create narrower strips . However , both are pretty for salads or vegetable dishes. < br />< br /> There 's a third kitchen tool in the set which is n't in the picture . It 's a small cleaning brush with a great ergonomic handle and stiff , metal bristles . It 's handy for cleaning the peeler and cutter ( although most of the time rinsing them under the faucet does the job ) and you 'll find plenty of other uses for it , too . Just treat it with respect . Those bristles are sharp !< br />< br />***** I was given a free sample of this product . The seller offered nothing but the sample and asked for nothing but an honest opinion. **** This is an attractive , useful set of kitchen tools . Nice for a shower gift or a house-warming . If you 're lucky , they 'll invite you back to eat some of the food .#### #### ####[([35], [34], 'POS'), ([261], [259], 'POS'), ([13], [12], 'POS'), ([78], [68], 'POS')]

Good tea brewing system . Is this method any better than just heating up water and filling up any old pitcher or a few mason jars with tea bags ? Not really , in my experience . But this kit just makes the process a little more streamlined and easier , I guess , especially if you want to cool down the brew by shaking it with ice ( which is this kit 's calling card I guess ) . I load up about 7 or 8 tea bags and brew according to their directions . Slightly ventilating the top lid after pouring just-under-boiling water in , and then spinning the cylinder that holds the tea bags a few times. . It brews really good tea . Have lots of ice ready though . When I do two batches in the two pitchers , the ice required to cool down the brewed tea during the &# 34 ; shaking process &# 34 ; depletes my refrigerators ice , leaving very little to put in a glass for iced tea . Bummer . Hopefully your fridge has more ice capacity !< br />< br /> The only faults I can find here are in the pitchers . A couple things . ( 1 ) Shake these pitchers with ice over a sink . No matter how tightly sealed my lids are ... they still leak a little bit and drip while I shake . Not a lot , just enough that I feel I have to do it over a sink . And ( 2 ) the pitchers do n't clean well at all . They always look spotty or slightly stained . I ca n't get them looking clean . It 's just the plastic staining , and I know they 're actually clean , but they do n't look so clean no matter what I do. < br />< br /> But I like the fruit infuser basket , and the tea cylinders seem well made to last . And while not ground-breaking , this system works well enough and there 's not much else to say !#### #### ####[([24], [19], 'POS'), ([175], [170], 'POS')]

Neat little oven . The unit toasts bread better than other toasters we have owned and this unit does it in 2 minutes at medium and faster at light toast .

I love these . I own four sets of them that I purchased at IKEA for $ 7 per set . Whoever is trying to sell them on here is coating on people not realizing they are dirt cheap . I love them and have been using them for the last five years . I like them more than the oneida flatware I used to have . The knives are super sharp ( my husband calls them butter daggers LOL ) and will rust if left in water for too long , but the rust will come off easily with barkeeper 's friend or something similar . The small spoon and small fork are indeed quite small , my four year old loves them because they are the perfect size for her . They are also perfect size for dessert ware . Overall , I love the set , but buy them from IKEA if you can , instead of here .#### #### ####[([109], [116], 'POS'), ([68], [71], 'POS')]

I could n't have been more pleased with my purchase of these bent glass straws . I 've used straight glass straws for several years now , but the bent ones are definitely nice to have for my taller glasses . We prepare smoothies almost every day in our house and the bent straws seem make it easier to enjoy our smoothies while we 're sitting down , so we do n't have to tip the glass very much if at all when drinking . The diameter of the straw is good for both thick and water based or juice drinks and the straws can be cleaned easily with the bottle brush enclosed with your order . I love that the straws are made with safe Pyrex-like glass , so I do n't worry about chipping or breakage . They 're an excellent way to help your household go green and they just look so classy too !#### #### ####[([13], [6], 'POS'), ([20], [23], 'POS'), ([61], [57], 'POS'), ([30], [38], 'POS')]

I bought one of these over a year ago and loved it . It still works perfectly though after a year of use ( Not constant , as I am not really a major coffee drinker ) . The only issue with it is that it has become harder to put the K-Cups into the machine . It does n't seem to punch a hole into it very easily anymore , and I think it might need sharpening , but I have NO clue how to go about getting that done. < br />< br /> I loved this coffee maker so much in fact , that I went and bought it for a friend as a gift who is a huge coffee drinker . She too loved it , though after about 6 months it lost it 's sharpness too and got to the point where it did n't punch through the k cups at ALL . So , I am assuming it 's a common occurrence for the brewer to loose it 's sharpness like that . It 's an issue I never really had with my old keurig , however that was much more expensive. < br />< br /> Overall ? A fantastic coffee maker for those on a budget . If you have the extra cash to splurge then by all means grab a Keurig , but this is a wonderful low cost alternative .#### #### ####[([55], [48], 'POS')]

MY FAVORITE AMAZON PURCHASE OF THE YEAR ! This blender ( the 900 series in particular ) is terrific . So easy to use , minimal clean up , takes up minimal real estate on the kitchen counter . Simple , sleek design . Wow , what a great product . CAUTION : do n't fill past the &# 34 ; fill line &# 34 ; on the cup ! It WILL overflow and get much caught in your motor ! Just take a clorox wipe and clean it up , but it can be annoying . The only problem of the inverted blending design . But as long as I use it as told ( ie do n't do that ) , it works wonderfully and has kept me well nourished while on a liquid diet for 7 weeks . Came quickly and free with Prime .

I freeze the juice from Costco size bags of limes and lemons in ice cube trays . For years I have used a small , $ 20 juicer but when it recently &# 34 ; died &# 34 ; I decided to try this more powerful one . I gave it 4 stars only because it is a little difficult to adjust the cord on the bottom to have the unit lay flat and not wobble on my countertop . Also , it 's not as easy to clean as my smaller one as the &# 34 ; bowl &# 34 ; is part of the unit itself and ca n't be lifted off and put in the dishwasher . It 's also taller and does n't store as easily . But , it juices quite nicely without the &# 34 ; jerky &# 34 ; motion of my smaller one . It also seems quieter ...

This apple slice is the best so far I have ever had ! It 's incredibly strong and durable . It 's made from strong metal material . The ends of the handle have a soft neon green rubber material proctection . It 's makes it that more enjoyable to use it . I make applesauce every weekend for my son . I have to peel and cut about 10 apples at one time if not more . The slicer blade is very sharp . So please be careful and do n't try to run your finger through the blade . I usually turn the apple inside down so it 's easier for the slicer to go through the the apple and get a even cut . The soft handles makes it comfotable and do n't have to worry about your hands starting to hurt . I do n't know where I would be without this slicer , you can even use it for boils eggs , pears , peaches , anything that comes to mind . This saves me so much time and I do n't have to worry about the seeds being stuck in my apple slices . I am so pleased with this product .

[[ VIDEOID : 64800e4ddd73886bc321842f4f7d8c81 ]] I have to admit , I am mostly a coffee guy . I have seen these ( I think they are Bodum ) and thought they were neat ( but crazy overpriced ) . Having tried this out it is quite nice , and very reasonably priced . Glass is good because it is easily cleaned and does n't impart any off flavors to whatever you are using it for . Beyond that it just looks elegant . You can watch your tea as it steeps and is calming and relaxing in itself . The double wall is great . It insulates your tea helping to keep it hot , while also keeping the outside cooler so that you do n't burn yourself . Once the tea has steeped , the infuser is easily lifted out and the lid serves double duty as a coaster to rest the infuser in . The rim of the double walled glass is smooth and has a nice mouth feel , there are no harsh edges . The volume is equivalent to a standard mug . Full disclosure this was provided to me by the seller for review . I know I said I am a coffee guy but this has convinced me to think about throwing some loose leaf tea into the mix . If you have any questions please leave a comment and I am happy to reply. < br />< br /> Amazon Disclosure Statement :< br />- I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review ; or < br />- I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. < br /> Why the statement ?

Such an awesome machine ! Although , none of the temperature / drying times in the book are correct but we 've come to learn what temperature works best for whatever it is that we 're drying .

Based on the comments and the allure of the whole unit fitting on my counter under the cabinet , I decided to go with the shorter & wider container rather than the skinnier & taller one . I regret this decision . Based on what I 've read about the wider & shorter container not sucking material down to the blades as well as the tall & skinny one does . Seems like regardless of what I do , my smoothie ( 2 cups water , 4 bananas , 2 apples , 1 carrot ) tends to still have unblended chunks of apple or carrot . I imagine it would be better with the tall / skinny container . Also , the unit does n't fit under my cabinet anyway . : (#### #### ####[([122], [116], 'POS'), ([28], [32], 'POS')]
I am very pleased with my Borolux baking dish ! It 's heavy , durable , and holds a lot of food ! Clean-up is a breeze. < br /> My family eats a lot of casseroles and I needed a dish that would transition from fridge to oven to dishwasher without any fuss. < br /> The thick borosilicate glass does n't stain or absorb odors from food . That 's a big plus for me. < br /> It 's the perfect size for family-style meals , sheet cakes , game-day dips , and fruit compotes. < br /> I received this baking dish in order to facilitate a review .

I have one giant plastic colander or the metal kind that are used for sifting , oh and one real small one for fruit . So when I was offerd this Collapsible Colander from Kings Fork for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it , I had to order one . It is really the perfect size . It is n't huge like my other one and it is n't too small like my metal sifters . It takes up little to no room in the cubbard , which is good because there is not extra room . I definitely recommend this Collapsible Colander from Kings Fork for your home kitchen needs .#### #### ####[([108], [100], 'POS'), ([61], [69], 'POS')]

I bought this a couple of weeks ago and immediately noticed a problem others have already mentioned - that it often boils for a very long time before the auto shutoff kicks in . Now mine is sometimes not turning itself off at all . The second time this happened I timed it . I let it boil for a good 10 minutes before finally turning it off manually . I assume it would have continued even after it boiled itself dry . BIG fire hazard . Do n't buy . I 'm sending it back#### #### ####[([29], [25], 'NEG')]

We had some issues with the straw not staying in place when you closed the lid , causing it to leak , but we called thermos and they sent replacement straws .

I have always had a toaster oven , going back to college . They 're just too darn convenient and efficient when compared to heating up an entire oven for most things . That being said , I 've always been in search of one that would handle ordinary 9 x 13 pans . I 've had ones that claim to take that but it 's only certain pans . I wanted something to fit my ordinary glass pyrex pans . This does. < br />< br /> I also did n't have a need for two racks - and this one only comes with one . I suppose if I contacted them , another is available for purchase. . but having had one with two racks , I 've never found the need to use both. < br />< br /> This has a convection feature - that 's super great , and definitely needed for a 9 x 13 pan . It also tends to speed up cooking and keep crisping even. < br />< br /> LOL , it is long . Do n't know why I found that shocking ( duh ?) but nonetheless , it took up a nice length of counter . I will say this one was n't as deep as my last 2 toaster ovens ( last one a Cuisinart ) so that was a plus. < br />< br /> I 'm a budget purchaser - I absolutely will not pay 200 or more dollars for a toaster oven . I came looking for something to truly fit a 9 x 13 glass pan , and I actually was hoping to find a Black & Decker . I expect that Black & Decker will last a good 4 to 5 years , and for that price , I 'm more than happy. < br />< br /> I also picked this up in Amazon Warehouse , for quite a discount - I got the one that had the ' worse ' reported condition and the one I got was perfect . I did n't even see the defects that were mentioned . No manual . No big deal . So I 'm even extra thrilled. < br />< br /> Amazon comes through again . Hope Bezos follows through with improving the work culture there . I want to know that the employees are being treated well and fairly .#### #### ####[([52], [48], 'POS')]

Prefer these to plastic pottles . The drinking spout is easy to clean .... other pop up style mouth pieces get discolored and look fungal after a while .

The hourglass shape on this 2 in 1 manual salt and pepper grinder allows me to get a really good grip when twisting to grind my spices . I hold the grinder directly in the middle and find it easier to twist the end !< br />< br /> The grinder is manual so twisting is left up to the user . I like this style more than electric because I can control exactly how much or little salt and pepper I would like on my food. < br />< br /> The ends screw off to refill the seasonings . Other seasonings can also be used instead of salt and pepper . I myself love that I can have many variety of seasoning inside the 2 in 1 grinder . I have one sitting out by my grill too with BBQ rub in one side and Seasoned Salt in the other end . Perfect at a BBQ table in my backyard , at the park for a picnic or at the dinning room table .

As a tea drinker , I am always looking for new tea accessories . This double-walled tea cup is both practical and elegant . I love the design , the shape , the way tea ( or anything else for that matter ) looks like it is floating because of the double wall. < br />< br /> The instructions say not to microwave , although some people have reported doing so without issues . However , I 'm not going to take a chance . I use a tea kettle to prepare my water , and then use this cup to steep it . I like that the cup is generously sized so I can have a nice large cup without having to make a whole pot . The cup is nice to hold - warm but not too hot . The double wall helps the tea stay hot so there is no need for me to use the microwave to reheat the tea , especially since the tea tastes best just freshly steeped. < br />< br /> There is a tiny hole at the bottom of the outer layer , I wondered about that , thinking it was perhaps a flaw , but the instructions say it is intentional , necessary because of the double wall design . It is not the least obtrusive , and I would n't have noticed it if I had n't been examinging the cup quite closely. < br />< br /> This one is a winner , and is going to see a lot of use in my household. < br />< br /> I am going to attach pictures , and the tea is one that I already had on hand , but I am so pleased with this cup that I am going to try teas from the company , too. < br />< br /> I was given this product for the purpose of review .#### #### ####[([11], [10], 'POS')]

I have had many coffee makers over 50 + years and this far and away the best bar none . It makes a great cup of coffee with settings specifically for 1-4 cups as well as the full 12 cups . The coffee stays hot right up to the 2 hour limit when it automatically shuts off . The most useful features are the removable water reservoir that means no water mess when trying to pour the water into a little opening . The reservoir pops right out and you can take it to the faucet , fill , and pop it back into the back of the coffee maker . Cute detail , the pot is on rollers that enable the pot to swivel for access to the back of the pot . The basket that holds the grounds comes out with the push of a button . It is programmable with easy to read blue led read-out . Make no doubt about it , this is a reasonably price coffee maker for everyone who wants to make a pot of coffee for family and friends .

I know this is completely my fault , but I really dislike how most pictures that are meant to describe and show an item for sale do not at all show the size of that item . These were way too small for my needs so as a result I 'll end up using them very seldom in the kitchen to pour or transfer powders and such . It would be helpful if photos provided showed true size .#### #### ####[([6], [13], 'NEU'), ([48], [41], 'NEU'), ([73], [66], 'NEU'), ([77], [76], 'NEU'), ([64], [66], 'NEU')]

Love this breadbox . Have used it now for around a month . It seems to keep our breadstuffs pretty fresh and also avoids staleness too early . Easy to keep clean . My only reservation was that I wished I had gotten a bread box that was &# 34 ; flat &# 34 ; on top so as to be able to use it as a shelf for other stuff . I.e. the rounded design means that I do n't set anything on top . But OTOH being rounded and having a translucent top / front makes for better visibility of the contents at a glance which is better in the long run . It 's just with counter space being limited having a place for additional storage on top outside of the box would have been desirable too . But not a deal breaker. < br />< br /> Also , the cover glides effortlessly and the construction of the breadbox seems pretty solid , at least so far . I see us using this as an integral part of our kitchen for a long time to come. < br />< br /> We can fit a whole loaf of bakery bread in it , plus a couple of 6 packs of english muffins . I even recently experimented with holding bakery bought uncut loaf bread ( Sweet Batard ) only in the paper bag that it came in , that was bought on a Friday evening and not cut until Sunday morning breakfast time . It held up just fine . NO staleness whatsoever . In the past I would have put it the uncut loaf into a plastic ziploc and then put it in my old open bread basket . Granted the cut leftovers were put into a ziploc and then stored back in this breadbox and they keep just fine for about a week . I worry more about mold than I do with staleness . So far we 've managed to use everything up before any mold forms and also everything has not had any real staleness for around a week. < br />< br /> I 'm very happy with getting and using this product .#### #### ####[([96], [93], 'POS'), ([282], [289], 'POS'), ([24], [34], 'POS')]

After receiving your Alpha Griller Instant Read Thermometer as a discounted item , I was very impressed by its size . Larger than other competitors , your thermometer has a nice hefty feel . It also comes with specific instructions and a temperature guide for different cuts of meat . There is even a temperature guide printed on the side ... a nice touch .

This is the most sturdy coupon holder I have ever used or seen for sale . The best part about it is that the dividers are sturdy plastic , rather than paper .

Peak Reserve Premium Wine Bottle Foil Cutter in a Premium Gift Box < br />< br /> I have a cork remover that had a foil cutter as part of it . Operative word is had and a lesson learned about loaning things . I did and got it back with a broken foil cutter . Enter the Peak Reserve foil cutter , I ’ve been doing it the wrong since the disaster of the broken cutter . No I can cut foil with the best of them . I took the cutter in my hand and with a squeeze and a few twists of the wrist , out popped a neatly cut top to the sealing foil on the bottle . It is super easy and it is very well built too . It also comes in a nice box which would make a great gift for your wine loving friends. < br />< br /> Do n’t poke through the foil , do n’t try to bite it off and do n’t use your finger nails . Do it right and clean and easy , use this Peak Reserve foil cutter . Your guests will think the world of you. < br />< br /> This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review .#### #### ####[([103], [102], 'POS'), ([191], [183], 'POS')]

Love this product . I have broken all my wine glasses , so I decided to give the one a try . It works perfectly for me . It is able to hold my wine ( maybe a little more then normal ;) ) and I do n't have to worry about breaking it if it drops . Although , I do n't want to drop it and spill my wine. < br /> The product is made out of silicone and is very flexible . You do n't have to use just wine , works great with beer as well .

Absolutely love this all in one < br /> Kitchen Kreations Stainless Steel Salt and Pepper Grinder ! It is extremely easy to fill , has a sleek modern design , and a compact footprint , which is all important in my smaller urban home . I also appreciate the caps that cover the grinder areas - these are great for storage or for taking on a picnic or glamping :- D < br /> I have filled mine , and use it at the table - works & looks great . My older individual mills are now the kitchen mills. < br /> Some things that folks might consider if they 're comparison shopping grinders :< br />- In my opinion , the grinding mechanism on these probably is not ideal for heavy kitchen use - I prefer steel or ceramic burrs , and these appear to be a plastic type material -- my experience with plastic burrs is that they do n't hold up to long term hard use - but - we 'll see , maybe these will be the exception. < br />- The grinding action ( where you put your hand to grind ) being at the bottom of the cylinder is a little odd and counterintuitive to me , also guests have been confused by it . Not a big deal , but a little different than standalone grinders , and possibly annoying for people who do n't adapt well to change :- D < br />- The caps , which * are * a good idea as far as cleanliness & good looks , are actually a bit of a P.I.A. to deal with at the dinner table - they are a little snug to take off and when removed , do tend to go missing easily , as they are unmarked , rather small generic looking circles of steel . I 've found mine in the trash a few times . Again , not a major issue , but kind of an annoyance in my world . My rating reflects these tiny issues in usability - not deal breakers , but could be just a wee bit better . Still - this all in one grinder is overall , a very good buy , good looking , functional & highly recommended. < br /> I received this product to test for free or at a heavily discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review .#### #### ####[([262], [268], 'POS'), ([34], [33], 'POS'), ([34], [27], 'POS'), ([240], [231], 'POS')]

Received an email from the company founder asking that I leave a postive ( 5-star ) review . Providing only a four-star review at this time as I have yet to use the gloves . That said , the gloves appear to be well-constructed . I like that the gloves fit either hand ( no dedicated right or left ) and the gloves ( sized large in my case ) seem to fit well . I will make note that I do not have large hands , so others with large hands might want to consider ordering a larger sized .

It 's a silicone baking mat . What else is there to say ? It performed admirably in keeping my pans crud free - any burnt stuff just slides right off , as does the food I 've been making . So far I 've made wings , ribs , and chocolate chip cookies on the mat , and each time clean up was a breeze compared to scouring the pan . I also like how it cuts down on my parchment paper use , especially since I hated trimming parchment paper to size as well ( yeah , I know , I 'm lazy ).< br />< br /> The bonus spatula - which is red for me , not orange as in the pic - is a nice bonus . It 's a pretty small spatula , so it 's not going to replace my bigger ones , but it 's good for getting things out of smaller containers like peanut butter jars . Not a necessity , but useful to have all the same .#### #### ####[([168], [159], 'POS'), ([163], [171], 'POS')]

Best water bottle ever . I have left it outside in the summer all day over night and through most of the next day to find it still cold and with ice ! You can leave it in your hot car all day and still come back to cold ice water ! I usually fill it and bring a bottle of water to do a refill on the go , it does n't matter if the refill water is n't cold bc there will still be ice in the water bottle making the water cold for drinking . I do n't leave home without this bottle and have been using it for 3 months now , it cleans easily and does n't sweat . The only con is it takes a little bit to get the ice in it bc you have to do a cube or two at a time bc the opening is n't very wide . I would Def buy this again and highly recommend#### #### ####[([90], [80], 'POS'), ([50], [48], 'POS'), ([86], [80], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS')]

These did a really good job of protecting my hands while using my mandoline chopper , but I guess I need to be more careful because after just a few uses , I already have a tear in them . Better the glove than my hand , but still a bit of a disappointment that they have not held up better . The julienne blades on the mandoline slicer are very sharp and that is how the glove caught and ripped . Otherwise , they are very comfortable to wear and even with the slight tear , I will continue to use them. < br /> These gloves were offered as a free add-on with the purchase of the SimpliFine Mandoline !#### #### ####[([14], [24], 'NEU'), ([30], [24], 'NEU'), ([64], [71], 'NEU'), ([113], [112], 'NEU'), ([36], [29], 'NEU')]

Fairly well made , very light kettle . I feel like it is a little expensive for grade and size . The metal is fairly thin and feels lightweight for stainless steel 18 / 8 . So far no issues with it . I like the way it looks , but you have to be careful about touching the knob on the lid if you had the burner on the highest setting , because it gets hot . I have learned to heat the water on lower settings ( I have a gas range ) . It does appear sturdily made . And I have left it sitting on the stove with water in it for a day or so and no rust anywhere when I would wash and dry it . After reading so many positive reviews touting this kettle as having a good bit of heft to it I wonder if I got the same item as the other reviewers . I have some very good stainless silverware . The butter knives are large and one piece and I had two of them in one hand and this kettle in the other and they seemed to weigh the same . That does not equate to &# 34 ; heft &# 34 ; . In my opinion all the weight comes from the handle and the knob on the lid . I am satisfied with it , but for the price and the grade of the materials I would not recommend it as a bargain , and had I had it in my hands before buying it , I would n't have for the price I paid . I feel like it worth a good ten , fifteen dollars less than its asking price .#### #### ####[([19], [25], 'NEU'), ([22], [28], 'NEU')]
This tea pot set is better than i expected . I bought the 40 oz , 4 piece set as a 1 year anniversary gift for my girlfriend and i know she 'll be ecstatic . Im even thinking about getting one for myself . The set was nicely and properly packaged with each item packaged in its own box with bubble wrap . I was pleasantly surprised to find 4 , not 2 , iron tea cups with the set , as the product was advertised to include only 2 . Also , the interior of the tea pot is not coated with enamel as described , which is better in my opinion , so i do n't have to worry about the enamel cracking when we boil water on the stove . ( Now , I am not sure if my order was a mistake by the seller when packaging or a discrepancy in the listing , but i would not expect 4 tea cups and a tea pot without an enamel coating if i were to buy another ; i 'd only hope it comes that way again :) The tea pot was smaller than i expected but it is the size described and is made with great quality , as well are the tea cups ( which do have an enamel coating ) , and the trivet . The included instructions for care are obviously a rough Japanese or mandarin to english translation which makes it a little difficult to understand , so i will be looking online for better instructions. < br />< br /> All in all , this is a wonderful set made with great quality and looks damn good . Makes me want a cup of tea just looking at it .#### #### ####[([61], [58], 'POS'), ([278], [286], 'POS'), ([292], [286], 'POS'), ([234], [240], 'POS'), ([27], [34], 'POS')]
Definitely not what i was expecting as far as product thickness / durability . They do what they say as far as containing food and the compartment seals seem to hold pretty well . I was a little disappointed in how quickly and easily I could break one though . I attempted to rinse the container with soap and water and while holding the edge and lightly applying a wet cloth , the edge cracked .#### #### ####[([70], [69], 'NEU'), ([59], [69], 'NEU'), ([73], [69], 'NEU')]
I 'm in love with these coasters . The artwork is subtle and yet so classy and elegant . I also love the earthtones used in the art as it coordinates very well with my bathroom décor . I 'm using these on a small wooden shelf in the bathroom to catch any drips from our bathroom glasses . I 'm really glad I used real glasses as the artwork shows through the bottom of the glass . And , the coasters absorb drips beautifully . I 'm very glad I bought these .#### #### ####[([6], [15], 'POS'), ([49], [45], 'POS'), ([66], [62], 'POS'), ([57], [62], 'POS'), ([53], [62], 'POS')]

We tried our best to like this device but the truth is our 7 year old ( broken ) spinner works better . What 's wrong you may ask ?< br /> 1 ) Handle barely locks / unlocks after fiddling with the poorly designed & cheesily manufactured slide button. < br /> 2 ) It 's very light , so light that it tends to spin itself off the counter when full of wet lettuce. < br /> 3 ) The stop button is inoperable which is not a big deal since it 's spins about half as fast as our cracked &# 34 ; old &# 34 ; spinner manufactured by Zyliss. < br /> 4 ) Speaking of spinning , it will actually spin but the ratchet mechanism misses every other gear so you end up pumping like there 's no tomorrow . If you 're lucky enough to get it going , well , see # 2 gripe. < br />< br /> Okay so &# 34 ; cheesily &# 34 ; is not a real word but &# 34 ; cheesy &# 34 ; describes this device perfectly . The price is great , maybe too great as it 's not worth the time &< br /> postage to return it . Hence , after 200 + amazon purchases , I decided to write my first review . Save some money and buy something more < br /> expensive .#### #### ####[([83], [85], 'NEG')]

My daughter will be using the foldable water bottle for school . She hangs it on the side of backpack and drinks it after gym .

This set is a good value ! The rack is sturdy enough , and the jars seal well . The shaker holes are slightly larger than I would prefer , but are not difficult to get accustomed to using . The jars are good for more than just holding various herbs ; I make various &# 34 ; seasoned salts &# 34 ; to use , like sea salt with jalapeno powder , for example . It goes really well on fresh popcorn ! For corn chips , I use a mix of powders ; cheddar cheese , cumin , cayenne , garlic , oregano , black pepper and tumeric . Makes regular corn chips taste excellent , great with salsa , or chili. < br /> The labels adhere to the glass very well , and are easy to apply smoothly , without bubbles or wrinkles .#### #### ####[([123], [118], 'POS')]

After trying another brand , I chose this product to attempt to provide better drinking water for my wife & myself . The product did exactly as advertised , & I would recommend it to anyone for that purpose . However , after comparing it to a commercially available bulk source in my < br /> area , I find that it would be far more expensive to continue to purchase filters for this product , than to buy the bottled water locally ( 5-gal-type ).< br /> I must emphasize that this product did do all it was advertised to do , but , in a testing comparison , the bottled water available at a local store ,< br /> in quantity , at $ 1.00 per 5 gallons ($ 0.20 per gal. ) was just unbeatable . We will be buy our water locally from now on . Thanks for the chance < br /> to let others know that this is a very good product - but , also to let them know that there may be other sources for the same results .#### #### ####[([112], [113], 'POS'), ([185], [180], 'POS'), ([133], [137], 'POS')]

I bought this unit because it was the least expensive unit that could handle 15 &# 34 ; wide bags ( for large fish fillets ) . I have not been disappointed .

This s and p grinder works quite well , and I really like that both sides can be set for as course a grind as I like . I also use it for dry rubs because you can put any dry spice you like in it and adjust the coarseness to your taste . The instructions in the box are helpful since the initial filling can take a bit of time to line up the locking mechanism . I downloaded their free e book and I was pleasantly surprised ! Lots of good tips and techniques there that are easy but actually make a big difference . I guess I 'm having fun with it .#### #### ####[([82], [81], 'POS')]
If you 're looking for rustic bunting , this is a great option for you . I wanted something rustic to go around the bridal table at my wedding , and this was a nice finishing touch .

I ordered this to replace a T-Fal that was similar . I like that it is just a wee bit smaller but still puts out enough steam to take care of what I need cooked .

* update * I cannot recommend this product : with light use , the screw used to attach the knob to the lid has heavy rust . I will be throwing it out today ( September 30 , 2015 ) after only 2 months of use . This product is a complete disappointment . The initial item description claims the product is 2.3 lbs. , but the actual weight it 8.3 ounces . The real weight is inferred further down the item 's page under &# 34 ; product details &# 34 ; where the shipping weight is declared at 8 ounces . Had I noticed that at the time of purchase , I would have removed it from my cart immediately . Usage notes : because it uses such thin material , the kettle begins rattling shortly after heat is applied . The &# 34 ; Whistling &# 34 ; function is nearly non existent . There is no good seal around vent nor the kettle 's lid . This inhibits the pressure required for any honestly whistling to occur . If anything , I would call this a &# 34 ; whispering &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; rattling &# 34 ; tea kettle . If I had been charged the full list price of $ 25.39 instead of $ 8.98 , this item would have been returned after first use citing : does not meet advertised expectations .#### #### ####[([19], [10], 'NEG'), ([56], [51], 'NEG'), ([22], [24], 'NEG'), ([163], [155], 'NEG')]

This product is very nice , but the Le Creuset branding of it sets a false expectation . Le Creuset is known for cast iron cookware - I we bought this product because we wanted a durable , unbreakable french press . Unfortunately this french press is made of only ceramic , so it will likely break like the tempered class ones we used to use . Would love it if Le Creuset would make a cast iron french press in keeping with the quality associated with their brand .

This thing is HUGE ! . I was n't paying attention really . I do make multiple loaves of bread at a time - it could easily proof 4 or 5 loaves . Or maybe 40 dinner rolls .

But it 's real solid and seriously reinforced at the corners. < br /> It does n't make sense to me that the lid is more expensive than the box .

This is the best espresso machine I 've ever had ( and I 've already had several ) . I 'm a coffee addict and i can only say i get impressing results with this machine ( I pair it with a Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder ) . Truly my coffee , espresso , americano , capuccino and latte 's are absolutely incredible ( much better than what you get a starbucks , for example , and i mean using starbucks coffee , you will still get much better results . Not that I am a starbucks fan but it 's a pretty fair starting point for most people ) . Anyway the bottomless filter is my favorite , yes you will see * a lot * of people complaining that you 'll get coffee spray all over the place and how much a mess you 'll have ... Believe me it 's just a matter of having the right grinder and mastering the tamping , that 's all . Yes it will take probably 1 or 2 weeks but after that you will be impressed . I do n't care too much for the pressurized filter since the coffee you 'll get is more standard and you 'll have to use a lot more coffee to get a strong shot . Just do yourself a favor and use the bottomless filter . It 's way worth it . Also I was having a lot of issues with frothing , i just could n't get any foam at all and i thought it was defective , but ( again ) the issue is on the user , turns out you need to just barely touch the milk surface with the frothing wand , and i mean barely touch it ( sometimes i think it 's even &# 34 ; before &# 34 ; the nozzle actually touches the milk ) . The key is that you should hear a fine &# 34 ; PSST PSST &# 34 ; sound and not a big &# 34 ; bubble &# 34 ; sound . I also find that i need to slowly lower the pitcher as foam is forming so that the top of the wand is always barely touching the surface . See this video for help : https :// www.youtube.com / watch ? v = UYFOE0qtoE0. < br /> I 've owned the machine for 4 months and so far everything is working just as new . I use it 2 or 3 times every day . No complains . Ca n't beat the price also .#### #### ####[([81], [89], 'POS'), ([257], [265], 'POS'), ([232], [231], 'POS'), ([23], [16], 'POS')]

Being gluten-free , rice is a staple . I stock my pantry up with an array of rice products , wild rice , sprouted rice , brown rice , basmati rice and more ! I have used my good old-fashion steam rice cooker for years but have been frustrated with the inconsistency of how the rice cooks . So I finally upgraded to this rice cooker . Wow ! what an amazing difference. < br /> Being a busy mom of 3 , I found the ability to preset the timer incredibly helpful . Yesterday , I washed three cups of mixed-grain sprouted rice before I left the house , set the timer for the rice to be cooked by 5:30 in the afternoon . When I got home , the rice was ready ! I used the plain setting ( based on the instructions from the Tiger manual - which by the way are so easy to follow and so precise on the type of setting to use for different combinations of rice products ) . The rice turned out to be nutty and moist . My husband and kids all thought the rice tasted sweeter , too . This morning , I prepared steel cut oats with the rice cooker - these have been sitting in my pantry for the last six months because no one in my family liked how they used to taste . With a little honey and a dash of cinnamon in the oats and my four year old twins devoured them ! The oats were tender , creamy and had a nice texture . Overall , I am very happy with this product and would give them as holiday gifts for my family .#### #### ####[([44], [38], 'POS')]
At this point I have n't used the knives , but I was disappointed in the color of the block . It is not nearly as dark as the pic and does n't &# 34 ; go &# 34 ; with my kitchen . I hope they cut well .#### #### ####[([29], [26], 'NEU')]
I am new to wine appreciation . This set is amazing . I want to start with the look ... It looks like class in a box . The box is very sturdy and elegant . When you get it the products are in plastic . I took off the plastic protective covers and put the pieces back into the box because I liked to so much & I keep it there . This is perfect to give as a gift . I had no clue that what i was ordering was so unbelievably perfect for any wine lover . The pictures do not do it justice . The wood on the handle of the opener is beautiful . There are no uneven seams between the wood and the metal . They both accent each other . It is so well balanced that even me with my fat sausage fingers could use this easily . The opener even has a foil cutter so you are not spending all that time trying to get the foil off to get to the bottle . Perfection. < br /> Lets move on to the Aerating Spout . If you do n't know about these you should read up on them if you are interested in learning about wine . So here is what they do ...< br /> Red wines need time to “ Breath ” but let ’s be honest , most of the time you open the bottle and want to drink it right away rather than waiting a few hours . Additionally research suggests that simply opening a bottle of wine and letting it rest in the bottle actually does n’t aerate it. < br /> The only way to allow your wine to breathe is by using a wine aerator pourer . Not only are wine aerator pourers great for parties but they are an overall must for anyone who is into or wants to get into wine . ( http :// www.wineaeratorpourers.com / wine-aerator-pourer-what-is-it-2 ) In short it makes your wine taste better . Buy this revel in the joy of it. excellent product . I received this item for a discount or free for an honest and unbiased review . Whether my review is good or bad , this is my opinion of the product . I have used this product myself . I was not paid or compensated in any way .#### #### ####[([246], [239], 'POS')]

I first saw this product in a Sur La Table catalog and looked it up online . I was very impressed with the cooker 's function as described in the online video clip . I 've always wanted to try using a pressure cooker but found it too cumbersome ( and frankly a little afraid ) to deal with the steam release protocol of conventional stove-top pressure cookers . I am so glad that I bought this electric pressure cooker ! Pressure cooking is so easy with this cooker . No messing with moving a hot heavy pot and contents from stove to sink for pressure release safely . The lid is automatically locked when it is turned on and stays locked until all built up steam is released . The timer function allows me to set it up and then just let the cooker do its thing . No need to keep constant watch . The cooker also comes with other functions like saute / sear , steam , slow cook , and roast . Have not tried the roast function but all other function works like a charm . Love the ease of use and time saving of pressure cooking .#### #### ####[([23], [30], 'POS')]

These reusable food containers are perfect for my kids school lunches and to premake dinners . You get 2 storage containers . When I clean up after dinner I just pack left overs right into the boxes so the next morning the kids can just grab their lunch and go . Then at school the kids can just pop off the lid and throw the whole thing in the microwave to warm it up . The kids have really been enjoying hot lunches and I can feed them much healthier food than the school systems do.They are also good for packing a sandwich and chips or fruit since it has 2 compartments and I can stop wasting so my Ziploc sandwich bags . The lid fits on nice and tight and I do not worry about them coming off in the kids backpacks. < br />< br /> During sports season we are always on the go getting kids to practices at different places and times . So I have been making dinners the day before and packing them in these containers . That way everyone can eat when they have time and can even eat in the car on the way to practices or games . We eat right out of the containers so there is less dishes to clean up. < br />< br /> One thing that is nice is the lids seals off the 2 compartments so I do not have to worry about the 2 areas mixing up when these are placed on there sides in the kids backpacks . I did do a water test where I filled the small area with water put the lid on and turn onto its side . The water would slowly leak in to the other compartment and even out around the sealed lid edges . This is not a real issue for me since I would never put that thin of liquids in these but just wanted to see how tight they sealed off . I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review. < br />< br /> Microwave safe < br /> Dishwasher safe < br /> Can using in freezer < br /> Reusable < br /> Made in the USA < br /> BPA free < br /> Tight locking lids < br /> 2 compartments#### #### ####[([218], [217], 'POS'), ([120], [127], 'POS'), ([276], [275], 'POS')]

This is the best lunchbox ever . My son is in 2nd grade and his school does n't have a cafeteria . I saw this and instantly thought it would be great for him to eat at his desk or out at the picnic tables . He absolutely loves it .

These look great on my stove . The pictures are nicely done . They are thin lightweight metal that fit over the outer edge of the burner drip pans for a clean look .

Pretty neat little gadget . Tonight was the maiden run to tempt our 2 and 4 yr old grandkids into eating zuchini . The 4 yr old is adamant about hating squash . I browned 1 / 2 lb sausage , added diced onion to a skillet . The suction cups are great and stick to the counter . I had a rather long zuchini , so I cut it in half . The front center fits on a little tube that sticks out on the blade side . Then I slid the.handle side into the squash . With all the little point it stays securely in place . I turned the handle and in very little time I had a big pile of spaghetti spirals . I added these to the skillet and satire until al dente . I drained a little of the liquid off , then put a little over 1 / 4 jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce over the mixture . I plated it up and sprinkled it with parmesan cheese . As an adult I would rate this dish a 10 for flavor ... It was good . The kids said they were eating snakes . The 2 year old ate all of his , and my squash hater ate 2 helpings. < br /> I LOVE that the blades store in the machine . The kids have been grabbing stuff off the counter as I cook lately and these will be safely tucked away . It is also handy to grab another blade. < br /> Briefings sent me an email with a link to videos on using the machine . If you sign up for an advanced membership , you can download a.cook book. < br /> I am excited to experiment with some other recipes . I truly believe eating fresh fruits and vegetables is so healthy and so tasty. < br /> I do have lots of kitchen gadgets , but this product provides a unique process . I will find a place on the shelf for it. < br /> I was in a kitchen store yesterday and I spoke to another woman and asked her how she was going to use her spiralizer . She said she could n't eat grains and she missed spaghetti . She had a hand unit in one hand and the boxed spiralizer in the other hand . I told her how securely the.machine sticks to the.counter . I had tried another hand unit and it ended up in the trash because it was a pain to use .#### #### ####[([164], [159], 'POS'), ([134], [142], 'POS'), ([161], [151], 'POS'), ([112], [116], 'POS')]
the one thing that distinguished this garlic press from all the others I have owned is the ease in cleaning it after use .

I purchased this for my 5 year old . I had spent ages trying to find a bento box that was leakproof , kid friendly ( easy to open / close on their own ) , and would last a long time . After using it for a year ( and about to send it off for another year of school ) , I can say that this has been the perfect lunch box !< br />< br /> Pros :< br />* It has been leakproof for thicker things like yogurt , applesauce , dips and dressings ( it is n't recommended for thinner liquids like soup ).< br />* I personally think the compartment sizes are great , though your mileage may vary depending on the types of foods you like to pack . It was more than enough food for my kindergartner !< br />* The middle circle is a great size for a dip , or a small treat ( ex : it was the perfect size for a few almonds and raisins )< br />* It was very easy for my child to open and close. < br />* It fit perfectly in a Skip Hop lunch box with just enough room for an ice pack . ( Will need a larger bag than that if you want to add additional snacks or things like a thermos. )< br />* Makes it easy to pack healthy and fresh lunches . The labels ( dairy , fruits , veggies , grains , protein ) are also a cute visual reminder for balanced lunches. < br />* Less waste ! Everything is in one place - no need to worry about extra bags / packaging , or losing things like lids. < br />< br /> Cons :< br />* I have one with what I think is an older insert ... . which is more of an open design , and does make for a bit more work for clean-up . It was n't hard to clean up , it was just a pain to dry . ( I see that the newer ones have a flat bottom , which looks like it may solve that problem !)< br />* If you pack a lot of whole sandwiches , you will have to cut it up and put it in perhaps two of the spaces . I typically just did half of a whole wheat wrap in the top left compartment ... but if you pack a ton of whole sandwiches , then the Yumbox Panino might be a better option . I also own that one and love it . It is a great size for an older child or adult !< br />< br /> After a yearat school , there are some scratches on the top and bottom of the box . The hinges are still working perfectly , and the seals are going strong. < br />< br /> I highly recommend this lunch box !#### #### ####[([115], [118], 'POS')]

When I received this , I was n't stupid enough to try one of my high end knives on it . Thankfully so. < br />< br /> I started with one of my older knives . One I do n't really use much and am willing to sacrifice to the &# 34 ; new product gods. &# 34 ;< br />< br /> After soaking the stones in water , I started with the 240 side and was initially pleased . The stone was smooth enough to easily run the edge across it , but I could feel the &# 34 ; bite &# 34 ; of the rough 240 grit . After a few passes , I had a good initial edge started. < br />< br /> Then I switched to the 1000 side and this is where everything went pear-shaped. < br />< br /> Rather than a smooth stone , I received a stone with tiny bumps in it . They are too small to be felt by running my finger over the surface , but my knife edge -- or I should say FORMER knife edge -- sure found them . I started with what was originally just a very dull knife . Now I have a knife with actual nicks in the edge caused by this piece of garbage stone. < br />< br /> Again , I 'm glad I did n't run an expensive knife over this thing . It 's worse than useless . Useless would n't damage my knife . This thing is a menace. < br />< br /> Stay far , far , away .#### #### ####[([153], [152], 'NEG'), ([175], [168], 'NEG'), ([116], [109], 'NEG'), ([123], [115], 'NEG')]

[[ ASIN : B01349YWU2 Johnny Appleslice Peeler and Slicer Combo Kit ( Grannysmith Green )]] I decided I wanted to try this apple slicer , and I must admit I was skeptical , but that is healthy . I bought into the whole bagel slicer years ago that did not work , so my expectations were not high . I was shocked at the ease of use of this little device . Do not let it fool you this is slicker than anything I have ever used as well as very sharp . Make sure you keep it away from youngsters. < br />< br /> My purpose was to do an entire bushel of apples and freeze them , however I was too busy playing with this to get them covered before they started turning , so I made an apple pie tonight instead and will finish tomorrow . I received this product at greatly discounted rate in trade for an honest unbiased review . I would purchase this product at full retail again , but it seems as though this product will last a very long time . # Johnnyappleslicer < br />< br /> You will notice I have many pictures , I was just amazed and had to keep trying apple after apple . Finally a device that actually does what it says it will do . For a mom and baker this is a must have . I almost forgot to mention the peeler , you will see in the picture I was able to peel the apple with one continuous motion . Good grip handle even with arthritic hands .

Love these !

And the reason for that. . when you fill it up with water. . it feels like its not enough . It feels like it wont make the whole round ice ball . Once you put the silicone top off ...

The grater blades it comes with are functional sizes : a slicer ( for cucumber slices ) , a large grater ( for carrots and stuff ) , a small grater ( for cheese , ginger , etc. ) and a nut grater ( for those of you who are into freshly ground nutmeg ) . It would be nice if it had a zester too . The little handle makes it easy to hold the thing in place while you 're working . ( I still recommend purchasing a cut-resistant glove to go along with it , though ).< br />< br /> However , it is made with a thinner metal than my OXO grater , and the blades are sharper than necessary . The parts are made from a brittle plastic , and the do n't fit together all that snugly . I am waiting with bated breath for the day that American companies realize box graters are clumsy to use and tedious to try to wash , and adopt a design more like this ... except with higher-quality materials ( and a zester blade ) .#### #### ####[([186], [179], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS'), ([99], [98], 'POS'), ([146], [141], 'POS'), ([55], [49], 'POS')]

This is a serious tool for zesting citrus peels . For some reason , the word &# 34 ; microplane &# 34 ; really conjured up something a bit more petite in my mind . Instead , this is a monster that will demand substantial space in my kitchen utensil drawer . It also comes with a hole in the handle to hang it , if preferred . The zester also comes with a guard , but the guard is somewhat flimsy and snaps on / off , which makes me concerned about the longevity overall . I would have preferred a scabbard style protector instead , which would last much longer. < br />< br /> This microplane is efficient at zesting , there are no problems there . The handle is substantial and easy to grip . There are some other things that I do n't like about this besides the guard , however . The rear edges of the microplane are somewhat sharp , despite rubber guards on the corners themselves . Since this portion is not covered by the snap on guard , I can foresee this producing injuries should anyone reach into that utensil drawer while being somewhat distracted . Being made in China means that I am also somewhat dubious about the quality of the stainless steel and its long term durability . I have had other &# 34 ; stainless steel ' products from China that have rusted rather quickly . Time will tell how durable it turns out to be , and if it rusts , I 'll update my review . ( Our humidity in the South is tough on things that rust easily !)< br />< br /> If this had been paired with a scabbard style guard instead of a snap on one , this would be a five star zester , assuming it is not going to immediately rust , despite the size of this beast . I have to admit , the larger than expected size means that it is easier to zest oranges and lemons ( my usual victims ) . I have not tried it with hard cheeses or chocolate yet . I have also not tried using it over a dish that I am garnishing , which may prove trickier for me because of its larger size. < br />< br /> Disclaimer : I purchased this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review .#### #### ####[([172], [165], 'POS'), ([239], [232], 'POS'), ([199], [203], 'POS'), ([226], [232], 'POS')]
These are the best bags . I can purchase extra veggies and fruit and not be concerned that they wo n't get eaten before they start to turn .

Ill be honest , i was very nervous to use this for the 1st time ! ! I do not know why , it is intimidating . Its a little metal thing , that fits in my palm , and it will stab the crap outta you if you decide to push on it . ( I may or may not be speaking from experience on this one ! )< br />< br /> I have a counter top hard boiled maker [[ ASIN : B00F0RDRFS Elite Cuisine EGC-007 MaxiMatic Egg Cooker ]] and the little water measure / egg piercer that came with it melted in our dishwasher . I think it fell of the top rack , or my husband is totally fibbing and put it on the bottom rack . ANYWAYS , I have been needing a new one forever and finally bit the bullet on this one . ( If you were not aware , if you are using a counter top egg cooker you HAVE to pierce the egg , they wont cook otherwise )< br />< br /> It works fantastic ! ! Its super small so it fits nicely in our drawers , but its cute and nice enough that i dont mind putting it on the window seal above the sink .

I 've actually gone through quite a few similar products in the past . Most are poorly made and full apart after a handful of uses . So when this arrived I was a little skeptical but thought I 'd give it a try . Surprisingly this actually made quite well , it feels sturdy while you are using it and thus far it has held up without any issues . The handles were easy to grip and the handles are made with a slip resistant material . Do n't think this will be easy by any standard . This will take some strength in the hand , but think about what you are squeezing and it 's not something that squishes easily . I was actually pretty blown away by how much juice actually was coming out of these lemons . I figured it was going to take 4-5 lemons to make 1 glass of lemonade but it was far less . I drink Arnold Palmers everyday so there is nothing better then homemade lemonade and iced tea . My neighbor lets his lemon tree just get packed full of lemons , they fall off then die . So I have a large supply of lemons just waiting for me to pick and so I take advantage . This although hard to do is fun for my kids too , they enjoy helping out . But parents you may need to help squeeze because it does take some strength to extract the juice. < br />< br /> I did receive this lemon squeezer at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review .#### #### ####[([185], [189], 'POS'), ([84], [94], 'POS')]

This is a really neat idea , but harder than I assumed it would be to use correctly . There is definitely a learning curve , and unfortunately these did n't come with any instructions . It took me actually reading other reviews to understand that there was a right way and a wrong way to put the top on to make it lock . So my first 2 attempts ended badly ( see first photo ) , then I read the review and tried again . In the beginning , where it was n't locking , extra water was accumulating , effectively turning 4 spheres into one giant funny looking cube . The third try was much more successful ( second photo ) , now knowing to fill the tray with more water than I thought I should , then put on the top piece and it forces the excess water into the top half of the balls to make the sphere . It still did n't work perfectly , but now I can see what needs to be done to make them right . It sure is a lot of work to get ice spheres , but if you really want them ( and I do !!) then it 's worth learning the tricks . I still wish it had come with even basic instructions , I 'm sure it would have made quite a difference for me. < br /> I was fortunate enough to review this product at no cost in return for an honest review .#### #### ####[([82], [74], 'POS'), ([75], [67], 'POS'), ([130], [132], 'POS'), ([58], [49], 'POS')]

It is a nice sized Thermos , which is the reason I purchased it . I use it for coffee on a daily basis . It seals pretty well , but I would n't risk putting it sideways in a bag or anything .

I was n't sure what to expect with this grater . I 've bought a lot of kitchen gadgets over the years and many have disappointed me ... but not this one ! It is sturdy and at over 7 &# 34 ; long it is large enough to get a good grip on it . It was super simple to use ... and ginger is NOT an easy thing to grate ! I used it for garlic , then washed it and used it for ginger . It came completely clean with just soap and water . there was no garlic aftertaste when I grated the ginger . It 's stainless steel so it will never wear out or break . Buy it once and you 'll have it forever !< br />< br /> The only thing that confused me was that the packaging said ; Crusher peeler and mincer . I cant see how this could be used to peel anything , but to mince or grate just place the garlic on a cutting board and place the tool above it . Push down and rock back and forth till the garlic is the desired consistency . The more you rock it , the finer the garlic gets . Best part is there are really no sharp spots so you ca n't accidentally cut yourself !

I really wanted to like this popper and thought it would be great for the kids after school . However , the corn is too dry without any oil , just like an air popper .

That kind of kills the convenience of a product advertised for cook and serve in the same bowl. < br />< br /> Finally , many kernels did not pop .

This might push closer to 4 stars depending on your uses . But using it as suggested left a lot to be desired for me . Its a well made product , and is a great execution of a sturdier zip loc type bag ...< br />< br /> But there is a reason ziplock bags get used , even though we have tupperware and lunch boxes and bento boxes and all manner of other storage container . And I have realized after trying to use these , its because mostly we need to throw them away when were done . Sure some things are more naturally suited to ziplock bags , but even then I do not want to be using these bags . They are just too much of a pain to dry and clean . Turning them inside out doesnt work because of the construction and so I 'm left with bits of stuff in the corners , or wet spots or both. < br />< br /> They are heavy duty and solid and are great for other non food uses . I 'm going to use them for organizing for camping things or keeping things dry . But for food , its just too much work when I can use zip lock bags and then toss them out .#### #### ####[([36], [35], 'NEU'), ([76], [74], 'NEU'), ([40], [35], 'NEU'), ([174], [173], 'NEU'), ([174], [176], 'NEU')]

This is maybe my 5th machine ? They started out around 20 something dollars . I learned to make espresso and froth milk on my first one . The pressure for milk has gotten better . The crema presence on the espresso has as well . I have always maintained that if the machine goes bad after a couple of years , ( average 3 ) , throw it out and get a new one . it 's more cost effective than the exprensive ones because repair on those is very costly . I get control over what beans I use , I actually hand grind on a bean press my husband got me from England , and I choose organic milk and real coffee syrups not the artifically flavored ones at coffee houses . This machine helps you make the best cappuccinos ! If you likie them dryer , you have to spend a bit more times on the frothing . No it 's not like a 2,000 dollar machine , but given th eexpertise you can develope , you can get a good cappo . out of it . The draw back with this latest model , ( thus the 4 stars ) , is the shape of the top cap to the resivour . It is very hard to loosen given the amount of suction it gets post brewing . I work out and I still fight with it ! when my husband thinks of it he loosens it for me before he goes to bed . lol If you want an good , inexpensive machine this is it . But people ... next model make a better ergonomical cap ! !#### #### ####[([132], [141], 'POS'), ([79], [80], 'POS')]

Have been using my Magimix toaster since May hoping I could write a positive review but it is not to be . I was so impressed by the appearance that I ignored all the negative reviews , so my bad . It is a beauty to look at but it does a less then stellar job of toasting . Just finished scraping the top of my toast once again . I have played with the different setting but it just is n't going to produce a decent piece of toast . It is either way to light or burned at the top . Not now and then but every time . If your want a toaster that does a good job of toasting this unfortunately it not the one . If your looking for a conversation piece this is for you . Too bad at this price we ca n't have both .#### #### ####[([120], [119], 'NEG'), ([35], [34], 'NEG'), ([135], [143], 'NEG'), ([44], [39], 'NEG')]

Home cooking has reached a new level with the price and ease of use of this device . It is incredibly easy to setup and take down . Making protein food dishes cooked to perfection could not be easier . With edge to edge exact temperature cooking , it 's nearly impossible to overcook something unless you leave it for too long . I have made many dishes with it and always get rave reviews on the food , people often think I 've done some kind of miracle to make it taste good , or that it took me a lot of labor . Nothing could be further from the truth , it literally is set it and forget it. < br />< br /> The fact that the food you 're cooking stays in a bag with all the juices is one of my favorite features of this device . It allows the meat to stay moist and does n't ever dry out . Vacuum sealing bags can add up to be a bit of an expense for this style of cooking , but there are a couple other ways to do it including a zip-loc technique which can be found online. < br />< br /> I love this device , and I use it as much as I can , it really beats out the oven or the smoker for meats .#### #### ####[([150], [146], 'POS'), ([54], [51], 'POS'), ([74], [66], 'POS')]

We have a really nice Indian restaurant near us where you take your own alcohol , it 's the nicest restaurant in the area so taking your own drink is a real plus and while they 'll gladly refrigerator your drink for you they do n't provide table wine coolers . Since we 've been six times in the last seven weeks I decided it was time to purchase my own wine bag , I looked at loads and checked out the reviews. < br /> A lot of the ones I liked had mixed reviews , one which I loved the look of worked when you filled it with ice but some reviews said it leaked after a while and I could n't risk that I also could n't chance it being knocked over. < br /> So all things considered I went for this one and I 've been very happy with my choice , I 've used it about 4 or 5 times and it 's worked really well , I keep it in the freezer so it 's always ready and it keeps the wine nice and cool although I have n't tested it for any real length of time it works perfectly for what I wanted. < br /> I 'll admit it costed more than I thought when I started looking but it 's a good solid bag which I would imagine will last years and years .#### #### ####[([23], [31], 'POS'), ([14], [13], 'POS'), ([28], [31], 'POS'), ([201], [200], 'POS')]

It does the job , but I highly dislike the fact that it does n't have an ON / OFF button - from my perspective , it is actually not very safe for kids . I also dislike how the hot air comes from the bottom of the device - I had couple kernels flying out of the popper before it actually started popping anything because of the air blowing it from the bottom . On a side note , it is also kind of bulky compared to other brands .#### #### ####[([41], [40], 'NEG')]

This in a little spice / herb grinder , sturdily made and pretty hefty for its size . It 's well made , with no jagged or rough edges or seams . The top is magnetic and slips on / off , to show the blades . To use the grinder , you put spices on the blades and turn it over , twisting the grinder . The section below the actual grinder holds the ground up spices , and you can get to it just by unscrewing that section . The very bottom section is a pollen catcher - there is a mesh screen between the third and bottom sections that filter out any larger particles , trapping the smallest particles ( and pollen ) in the bottom compartment , and a little scraper to get the smallest pieces out. < br />< br /> The one downside is that it does n't come with any instructions , so if you 're not familiar with how to use or clean it , you might be lost . If they can add instructions , I would upgrade this to five stars , but my own confusion and frustration as I figured out how to use it automatically knocked it down a star . I ended up having to find a video on another similar spice grinder 's product page to figure out how to use it , which should n't be necessary. < br />< br /> I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review#### #### ####[([258], [257], 'POS'), ([129], [120], 'POS'), ([250], [257], 'POS')]

This is a big cleaver ! I like the fact the edge has some curvature to it , so you can rock it while chopping vegetables . It 's also heavy ( 32 ounces ) . Was delivered sharp enough to go through Chicken Keel bones with ease but for finer chopping tasks like vegetables , I took it to a 1200 grit Japanese synthetic stone for further refinement . If you are looking to buy your first cleaver , this is a good choice for the money as it is not too pricey yet I feel there is plenty of quality here for a utility chopping knife , or you can use it as a cleaver , for getting through large cuts of meat , but I bought it primarily for general chopping in the kitchen , like I would use a traditional 8 &# 34 ; chef 's knife , though between these two ( this cleaver and a chef knife ) , the chef knife will be a lot nimbler . Despite the heft , it 's a fun knife to use in the kitchen for smaller tasks < br />< br /> Know this , the material of the blade is not stainless steel . Product description says it 's cast iron . To me , it 's carbon steel meaning when the knife is not in use , keep a coating of food grade oil on all metal surfaces , so it wont rust . I 'm using tea tree oil as I have a good size bottle of it . Forewarned is forearmed . I 'm also keeping the wood handle treated with a homemade wood preservative I keep on hand for wood cutting boards , 50 / 50 beeswax and mineral oil , because the wood handle is only stained and not sealed . You could shellac it or spray a coating of clear Krylon to protect the wood , or even just use food grade oil , rubbed into it , so it wont dry out and crack . Remember , this is an economical cleaver , the blade is thick and has plenty of metal there for future honing 's so it wont wear out in the long term , unless you 're a tradesman and use daily and hone accordingly . Even then , it will last a good long time IMO < br />< br /> FWIW , I did n't have a proper knife block that would accommodate this cleaver so I bought this magnetic knife rack http :// www.amazon.com / gp / product / B00WGKR7NK ? redirect = true & ref _= cm _ cr _ ryp _ prd _ ttl _ sol _ 2 from Amazon to hold it < br />< br /> If you are going to buy this as a general cleaver in the kitchen and want to use it for smaller work like chopping vegetables and you have smaller hands , I would look to one of the smaller cleavers made by the Thunder Group . The wide blade makes short work of picking up the vegetables you just chopped , negating the need to use both hands to move your chopped work into a bowl. < br />< br /> This is a large cleaver and is heavy to use since it weighs in at 32 ounces , but if you have large hands and want a fun cleaver to use for general chopping and do n't mind maintaining the carbon steel blade ( keeping it oiled between uses ) so it wont rust , I highly recommend it < br />< br /> I posted a pic showing two cleavers ... the other cleaver is a 7 &# 34 ; cleaver I bought through Amazon , this one http :// www.amazon.com / gp / product / B002NQP13K ? psc = 1 & redirect = true & ref _= oh _ aui _ detailpage _ o07 _ s00 < br />< br /> This other 7 &# 34 ; cleaver is half the price of the thunder group ($ 15 vs. $ 31 ) and the blade is stainless steel on the 7 &# 34 ; Update International cleaver , & has a nicer riveted handle that fits well even in my large hands but if you look at the edges on these two cleavers , only the thunder Group cleaver has a rounded edge profile . The 7 &# 34 ; Update International cleaver 's edge is flat ( straight line ) between the toe and the heel , so not made to be used as a rocking type of cleaver . Instead , it 's made to cut through large pieces of meat , and it does that well . You 'll have to forgive me , it looks like I 'm reviewing two different cleavers here , towards the end of this review for the Thunder Group Cleaver yet I included the picture showing both cleavers that Amazon sells , both of which I own and have used and I 'm merely pointing out the differences and if you want a cleaver that can be used on a cutting board to chop vegetables , purchase the thunder Group cleaver , it 'll do a better job of doing a rocking type of chop , despite what some may view as having some negative features , being an all carbon steel blade that is susceptible to rusting , if proper care is n't used , but if you are like me and like to craft edges on your knives , I prefer an all carbon steel blade to a stainless steel blade for ease of honing purposes . Also , the edge on the 7 &# 34 ; cleaver has a hollow grind to it just above the edge , and not as easy to sharpen as the more angular blade on the thunder Group cleaver , where it 's just two bevels intersecting , w / o any hollowness added at the edge . Sorry , but I digress =:-)#### #### ####[([43], [38], 'POS'), ([281], [280], 'POS'), ([166], [172], 'POS')]

Very poor construction , a big decline in quality from the previous Kamenstein we purchased . The first rack we purchased fell apart when removing from the box . Replacement from the company is not much better . The ball bearings are so poor that the rack does not rotate freely , so the base turns with the &# 34 ; rotating &# 34 ; rack , so good luck if its in a cabinet . Both units displayed this major defect . The rack itself is made of very cheap , light weight plastic . The ball bearings must be very cheap and do not permit the rack to rotate freely , or smoothly . The spice containers are good , that is the one bright spot . Unfortunately , the rack is very poor in overall construction and performance , ...... defeats the purpose of having a rotating rack . I would NOT purchase this item ever again .

I had received the same mug for Mother 's day many years ago ( 10 yrs maybe ) and it broke . It meant a lot to me so I wanted to replace it . This one looked the same as the one I had but when I received it the child and some other artwork on the mug stand out in raised relief . I do n't like the look of it too much .

[[ VIDEOID : 48503edd5e4d5b64083c246e7a2465bf ]] I have a family of 8 so buying in bulk is a must ! We 've always used a vacuum sealer but it really never worked great for bagged foods . I ca n't even begin to calculate how much money we 've spent over the years on food we 've had to throw away because it was n't closed properly after it was opened. < br /> When I purchased the Flexzion 16 \\" Impulse sealer , I was n't really sure it would work or be easy enough for our older kids to use . When it arrived I was immediately impressed with how sturdy and well made it was . We plugged it in and started going through the pantry looking for things we could seal . I 'm including a video with review to show you the first thing we tried . This is my teenage daughter using the impulse sealer - she said it was simple and \\" COOL !\\" . It 's as easy as setting the bag onto the sealer , making sure the heat setting is appropriate for the material being sealed , and pressing down on the handle . The light on the side shuts off when the seal is complete , letting you know it 's finished. < br /> My husband has worked in the food packaging industry as a service tech manager for 20 years so he was the final word on the quality of this impulse sealer . He has built and fixed more food packaging machines than you can imagine ! He said the Flexzion Impulse Sealer creates one of the best seals he 's seen in something so easy to use. < br /> In just the short time we 've had this , I know we 've already covered the expense in food we did n't throw away ! I think everyone should have a Flexzion Impulse Sealer !< br /> I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review#### #### ####[([263], [261], 'POS')]

I 've been a tea-drinker for a long time and started brewing loose tea as soon as the Internet came along and I could get it . I 've had at least four other types of personal tea-makers and this is hands down the best. < br />< br /> I do n't know how borosilicate glass is manufactured , but it is noticeably different from conventional glass . It LOOKS fragile , but it 's tough . I 'm sure you can break it , but I 've tapped it rather forcefully against hard surfaces without a crack . It also holds up to high temperatures much better than regular glass. .< br />< br /> This design is lovely , while being totally practical . The infuser fits down into the cup and the glass lid keeps the water hot while the tea leaves are steeping . When it reaches the desired strength , you take off the lid and place it upside down and the infuser rests in it . No drips . When I received this , I envisioned that I would be pouring the tea into a mug . Who wants to drink tea out of a cup with no handle ? Much to my surprise , I do ! . Because the cup is double walled , you can cradle the cup in your hand and feel only a pleasant warmth . It 's a delightful experience. < br />< br />***** I was given a free sample of this product . The seller offered nothing but the sample and asked for nothing but an honest opinion. **** If you brew loose tea , this is a great system . It also comes beautifully packaged If you want to please a tea-drinking friend or relative , give them this brewer . It 's so modestly priced , you can afford to include a package of good loose black or green tea . I promise they 'll love you for it . I know I would .#### #### ####[([37], [36], 'POS')]

I bought this set elsewhere but had to come review it because I love it so much . I bought this set to replace a different set that I had difficulty putting on the lids and taking them off . This set is very easy to put on and remove the lids , but the reason I love it so much is the steamer insert . I steam food once a week or so . The way I used to do it is in a pasta pot with a steamer insert . I would spray the insert with coconut oil spray , and then steam anything I wanted ; veggies , frozen meatballs , frozen pot stickers , etc . I did n't have a problem with the food , but the clean-up was rather an ordeal . Actually , not that bad , but annoying enough that sometimes I would n't use it . This steamer is so awesome I am steaming food a couple times a week . I put a couple tablespoons of water in the bottom , put whatever I want to steam in the insert , place the lid on loosely , and then microwave for a few minutes . Not only is is faster than my old method , but much easier to clean . I am very happy with my purchase .#### #### ####[([165], [159], 'POS'), ([132], [142], 'POS'), ([166], [159], 'POS')]

This is my first review I have ever written on a product before . This blender has been nothing but a pain to use . First off it leaks all over when blending into the unit . There is no easy way to clean it and it will eventually start to smell . Next it is nearly impossible to open it . The cover is on so tight even with the leaking ! when you do finally get the cover off there is smoothie all over the cup that you have to wash off before enjoying .

These are simply the best idea for dispensers ever ! We had a couple of bigger glass and plastic dispensers but they took so much to fill them and hard to keep cold . And storage ? Where to store them ? UGH ! So we saw these and are absolutely delighted with them ! They did n't take up too much room on our tables , easy to refill , just grab the handle to move ! Easy to add ice to , everything was just simple and easy . They hold about 4 quarts so it was perfect for ice tea and lemonade . And I have to admit , we will use them for wine also ! I am totally happy with these ! Oh , and storage ? NO PROBLEM ! Collapse them and stick in a cupboard ! And the best part .... they were VERY reasonable . A great find for sure !#### #### ####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([155], [157], 'POS'), ([81], [89], 'POS')]
This product does what it claims and is supposed to do ... it will make tea . I 'm still in the testing interval , but so far it has not broken when near-boiling water is poured into it , the handle has not broken off , and the basket assembly needs relatively little maintenance after loose tea is used in it . The only thing about it that I feel needs changing is to increase the volume , and that is nit-picking , really . As it stands , it fits in a shelf-spacing that will hold a half-gallon milk or juice container , and its being taller would not improve its usability. < br />< br /> Overall , I find it to be what it claims to be , and would recommend it to anybody who wants the claimed functionality .#### #### ####[([65], [64], 'POS')]
Beautiful carafe , nice size and the silicone stopper works well . My only issue is , the glass seems very fragile . I do n't think it would actually withstand hot liquid despite the description saying it would . I have granite countertops and I find myself holding my breath as I set the carafe down , even more so when my kids are handling it . I think a great addition to this product would be a removable silicone base that slips onto the bottom of the carafe . I have glass water bottles with the removable silicone sleeves that give that needed &# 34 ; cushion. &# 34 ;#### #### ####[([8], [13], 'POS')]
My wife is Vietnamese and is obsessed with Vietnamese Coffee and got me into that type of drink . I usually only drink it on the weekends though , and am more of a black coffee guy during the week . The way to make a perfect cup of vietnamese coffee is by having a French Press . So decided to actually get one since we always use one at her mom 's house . Tried this product over the weekend and really loving the quality . Even comes with a spoon . Perfect size especially if you want something quick . To make the perfect cup of vietnamese coffee , use a french press , and add condensed milk at the end when pouring in your cup . ENJOY ! ** I received this product my for my unbiased review .

Great knife . Super sharp . The handle is a great shape ( I have a small hand and sometimes that 's an issue for me ) . And the scallped blade does indeed help with friction and keeping slices from sticking to knife . And , of course , if you love purple this is awesome !!! ! I 've received many compliments on both the color and the working of the knife. < br />< br /> I must say that the customer service was the best I 've ever received on Amazon . The company , DKB , replaced the knife with no shipping charges . It is likely I made an error on my part , and yet they replaced it anyway.Their communication was awesome .

This is a beautiful 3 piece set offered by EBI Homegoods . I was actually really impressed with the quality and look. < br />< br /> Perfect for a wedding shower or house warming gift with it 's included mesh metalic ribbon cinch bag . Each piece is made from a durable stainless steel . It is light in weight . The silicone heads of both the spatula and whisk are BPA free and can withstand heat up to 480 degrees Fahrenheit. < br />< br /> The spatula is about 11 &# 34 ; long . The silicone head is secured by a long flat stainless steel insert . The head can be removed for easier washing . It is dishwasher safe . The entire head is a smooth surface . The high grade silicone does not appear to absorb smell or stain . Egg is still a challenge and sticks to the spatula , but didnt require scrubbing as with any other spatula . Just a rinse and quick wipe and it came off easily . There is a stainless steel hoop at the end of the spatula for hanging your spatula on a utensil rack , or you can just store it in a drawer , which is what I do. < br />< br /> The whisk is about 10 &# 34 ; in length . The silicone hoops are flexible and wo n't scratch your bowls . Whisking scrambled eggs in the actual pan has never been easier or safer . No more bits of non-stick coating scratched off in my breakfast . Very easy to clean as well . The whisk also has a hoop on the end of the handle for hanging. < br />< br /> The cake tester is about 7 &# 34 ; long . The probe itself is stainless steel and has a silicone head that says &# 34 ; Cake Tester &# 34 ; . The silicone head on this does n't come off for cleaning , but it is easy enough to wipe clean with a little soap and water. < br />< br /> While I use my set for my own baking and cooking needs , I can imagine someone taking this trio and making a gift basket with it including mixing bowls and measuring cups as a house warming gift or even for a bridal shower . It is really a nice looking set . Much nicer than the average plastic handle sets you see at Home Goods or Macy's. < br />< br /> I received this set at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.r my honest and unbiased review .#### #### ####[([54], [52], 'POS'), ([232], [235], 'POS'), ([108], [107], 'POS'), ([296], [304], 'POS')]
The kettle is very sharp looking and a little retro . The whistle does n't whistle , it rings like a Tibeton ringing bowl . You want to say Oomm when it rings .

Very pleased with the purchase .#### #### ####[([47], [43], 'POS')]
This is an awesome cup ! I am very satisfied with this set of products ; high quality and good price . Stainless steel is more durable than ceramic .

These bottles are the cheap solution to needing a water bottle . Honestly , nothing beats the flow of an actual water bottle , but these are n't a terrible solution for capacity . My only issue thus far is the nozzles want to return to closed while drinking , which obstructs flow , and the flow when the bottle is squeezed is a little much at times . Cheap enough to not be too concerned if life destroys one , forget it somewhere , etc .#### #### ####[([32], [29], 'NEU'), ([67], [69], 'NEU')]

I 've used this once and it does the job admirably . The thermometer comes on automatically when you extend the probe and turns off again when you close it , which alone it worth the price of admission . The fact that the probe is protected from bumps and falls is super . The housing has your typical temperature guidelines silkscreened on it , which is helpful , though these will probably wear off over time . It comes with velcro dots so you can hang it in exactly the right place. < br />< br /> I got a steep discount on this item from the manufacturer with the understanding that I 'd write a review .#### #### ####[([36], [34], 'POS'), ([81], [91], 'POS'), ([59], [67], 'POS')]
I used to gaze at the fancier bottles of wine in my collection yearning to drink them , but completely befuddled as to how to find the bottle 's cork . I knew the cork was hiding somewhere underneath the shiny metal foil firmly affixed to the bottle neck , shimmering like an elusive mirage . However , attempts to remove this stubborn oenophilic chastity belt with a knife or a scissors proved futile , and on one occasion practically fatal . While awaiting paramedics to arrive after severing a major artery and collapsing face down in a puddle of my own blood , I vowed to never again risk my own life attempting to remove another dastardly wine foil. < br />< br /> And so I was sadly relegated to drinking screw-top bottles of wine , doomed to live a pathetic , solitary life . I soon learned that nobody wants to be with a man who only drinks screw top or boxed wines ; that 's no a man , that 's a child . Feeling hopeless and lonely , I decided to cash in my life savings and move to Minsk where I could spend the rest of my days drowning my sorrows in bottles of vodka with easily removable caps. < br />< br /> In a shocking twist of fate , on the morning of the day I was set to leave on a one-way flight to Minsk with no possibility of return , I happened upon an advertisement for a life-saving product called Edgy . Edgy provides a safe , reliable way to remove wine foils with no messes and no accidents . Now , the fancy bottles of wine that used to mock and taunt me are crushed like ladybugs . I guzzle Domaine Leflaive Montrachets , Screaming Eagle Cabernets , and Henri Jayer Richebourg Cotes de Nuits like bottles of water , all thanks to Edgy . Yes , I am now drunk literally all of the time , but I 'm also happily married ( I think ) to a woman ( I think ) who is stunningly beautiful ( I think ) . And it 's all because of Edgy. < br />< br /> So thank you , Edgy , for saving my life .#### #### ####[([258], [267], 'POS'), ([275], [265], 'POS'), ([286], [283], 'POS'), ([258], [265], 'POS'), ([210], [213], 'POS')]

This spatula / cutter is one of several Cutco knives and items I stumbled on at a garage sale this summer for $ 3.00 per piece and I 've been giving them all a work out . I 've never owned Cutco before and I have to admit , these are great knives etc . This spatula is very well balanced and even having purchased it used , I ca n't tell it is n't brand new . The handle grips are placed exactly where you want them for easy holding and no slipping as you ice a cake or use the serrated edge to cut a cold ball of cheese for a snack tray .

The Rick Bayless Ceramic Baker is a high quality baking dish that can be used for a variety of food types . The feature that stands out with this dish is the red exterior which looks great when setting out on a table after baking in the oven . The dish appears to be well made with a built in lip on the sides which make it easy to grab . Unfortunately there is no included lid and the oval shape limits the quantity of food being prepared . Another negative is the relatively high price considering the size of this dish. < br />< br />*** Positive Points : ***< br />< br />- Heats evenly and does a good job of cooking < br />- Easy to cleanup < br />- Red color is attractive and looks great when serving < br />< br />*** Negative Points : ***< br />< br />- High Price < br />- Does not come with a lid < br />- Oval shape is not as efficient as a square or rectangular baking dish#### #### ####[([76], [67], 'POS'), ([80], [90], 'POS'), ([80], [79], 'POS')]
Nice looking set but rather flimsy .... the notched holes in the bottom plate do n't let tools to fit because base touches the surface of the counter or table . I corrected this by purchasing some rubber feet to raise the holder just off the surface so the tools can fall into the slots and secure them from moving. < br /> The shaker leaks when filled with liquid and shaken .... a few times I was able to secure the top and prevent a mess but not exited to try it again so I replaced the shaker with another one I had and have no problems .#### #### ####[([82], [74], 'NEU'), ([9], [5], 'NEU'), ([75], [78], 'NEU'), ([9], [0], 'NEU'), ([69], [78], 'NEU')]

Item arrived with a stress fracture . Upon washing another item , OXO cereal storage container , it bumped against the side of the countertop . It too exhibited a stress fracture . The items received are very fragile and not up to the OXO standards . Either OXO has dramatically reduced the quality of their containers or the containers received were knock-offs .

And there you go coffee is done throw out the filter and throw this in the dishwasher . I need another one . You can use it without a coffee filter but coffee grounds get stuck in the holes and the holes are big for coffee so you will have murky coffee . Still an exceptional product .

Beautiful bamboo hot plate holder !

This item is very nice . I was looking for a nice vintage-esque piece for my dinning room table . It definitely goes with the style I was looking for . I would have given this item 5 stars except for the handle is welded on a tad crooked , The salt and pepper shaker jar lids do not screw on ( just pop on ) , and the two glass jars are larger than the ones pictured . It is very pretty though and I use the relish jar for sugar . Overall I really like it .#### #### ####[([17], [11], 'POS'), ([76], [73], 'POS')]
Received quickly . Used it today while smoking a loin . Have to get pork to an internal temp of about 160-165 . One problem with other meat thermometers is the probe is not very long . The probe on this one is at least 8 inches and penetrates easily . The case is handy too , provides a place to keep the reader when not in use . It is fast and I am pretty sure its accurate as well .

This is just another kitchen gadget that has no real benefit over something like the [[ ASIN : B00008GKDQ Lodge Cast Iron Grill / Griddle ]] ( which we use all the time , including for cooking hamburgers in the winter ).< br />< br /> My list of pros and cons are :< br />< br /> Cons :< br />* HUGE to store . I have a big house and I do n't have anywhere I 'd want to store this . It 's not supposed to be kept outside and while the cooking surface is n't large , the lid and stand make it large. < br />* It does n't have two heating surfaces like a standard Foreman . The red part is literally just a lid and there is just one cooking surface. < br />* The cooking surface heats unevenly. < br />* 12 servings ? I think 8 or fewer , especially burgers . There 's no way you could fit 12 burgers on this thing. < br />< br /> Pros :< br />* You could potentially take it outside ... if you want to run an extension cord out of your door or window , or have an outlet in just the right spot. < br />* The non-stick surface works well enough and it was reasonable to clean in the sink. < br />< br /> I honestly think the only real application for this would be an apartment or somewhere you 're not allowed to have a grill and for some reason do n't like the Lodge Grill / Griddle . Otherwise it 's just another kitchen gadget .#### #### ####[([207], [211], 'NEG'), ([218], [225], 'NEG'), ([218], [217], 'NEG'), ([125], [124], 'NEG')]

I bought this to replace a grater that belonged to my roommate and I broke simply by washing it in the sink . Needless to say , the other grater was not very sturdy . This one is clearly better because of the metal construction in the parts that are likely to receive the most shear stress. < br />< br /> We use it to grate Parmesan cheese and it works wonderfully . I highly recommend this if you want a fine grate .#### #### ####[([55], [50], 'POS'), ([43], [39], 'POS'), ([21], [23], 'POS'), ([29], [39], 'POS')]

Highly recommend these mugs from Drinkware Essentials .

Had high hopes , but this cooker is just not that well designed . There is a regulator ( not the knob ) that eventually lifts in place based on the pressure , locking the lid when it starts to get pressurised . This component sometimes would not lift ( if for instance , using a small amount of water or food ) and effectively overcook whatever you put inside it . I have to baby the pressure cooker and occasionally use a screw driver or pipe cleaner to grab the regulator and give it a pull to lock it. < br />< br /> Steaming function never worked . Set it to one minute or 10 minutes either way it will continue to steam until it over heats or destroys your food < br />< br /> There is a small plastic cup that attaches on the side of cooker for collecting moisture . It 's tacky and held in place with plastic ridges ; on my unit these did not work and the slightest touch causes the cup to fall off . Used a magnet to hold it in place. < br />< br /> The times the pressure cooker had no issues the food was delicious and it worked as advertised . But I need something reliable and this is not it .#### #### ####[([148], [157], 'NEG'), ([148], [141], 'NEG'), ([206], [208], 'NEG')]

Not bad , it blends pretty well for an &# 34 ; on the go &# 34 ; kind of morning shake for your daily commute . I tried using it once to cook with just to experiment , and you 're better off with a different kind of blender ( read different kind of container ) .

Very mixed feelings . I purchased two of these for my 5-year-old twins ( normal motor coordination and such ) . They are off to Kindergarten this year , and I wanted something very simple for them to use at school during lunch-time . I thought this was perfect since it only required opening one container rather than having them open tons of baggies and containers for each type of food. < br />< br /> My idea backfired a bit . The problem is that the container is VERY difficult to open , even for me . The seal on it is great ( keeps things separate and fresh ) , but because of this , it creates a strong suction when opening it and it 's near impossible for my kids to pull it open . We 've been practicing each day so they 're not totally struggling at school . It 's also incredibly hard to close . The hinges allow the lid to slide back slightly , so in order to close it you have to hold the hinges flush in the back ( or pull forward on the lid ) while pushing down on the lid at the same time. < br />< br /> It 's so unfortunate . The quality is great , it 's very durable , works perfectly holding their food . Easy to wash . Good size . I 'm just very upset it 's so hard to open and shut for a child . It defeats the purpose . Seems that a small handle or lip on the outside of the container , allowing you something to grasp while opening and closing would have helped. < br />< br /> Also ... if using for school lunch , you need to also purchase a bag for it to go into . This container has no handle so a child may have a hard time carrying to the lunch room ... also obviously need the bag to hold their drink and utensils and such . Would have been cool if it had a handle and a place a thermos could snap on or something. < br />< br /> All that said , I 'll see how it works for the first few weeks of school . I 'm hoping my kids get the hang of it , because I do like it . If I could give 3.5 stars I would .#### #### ####[([99], [90], 'POS'), ([143], [136], 'POS'), ([16], [14], 'POS'), ([216], [223], 'POS'), ([229], [223], 'POS')]
I bought this machine about a month ago and have had nothing but a positive experience from using it . I 'm a person that does their research about expensive products before buying and I just was n't sure whether or not to go for the 2.0 brewer . The main reason people did n't like it is because their k-cups were n't compatible . This is my first brewer , so any k-cups I bought were already made compatible with this brewer . I found it easier to order straight from Keurig 's website and they delivered in a decent amount of time ( I say that because I 'm used to Amazon 's 2-day prime shipping ) . I 'm a college student in a small apartment , and this was the perfect size for my counter . It does n't take up much space at all , can open up fully under my cabinets , and even has the 40oz water reservoir so I do n't have to reach back and fill it up with water every single time I want to make a cup of coffee . In addition to coffee , I 'm a fan of tea beverages and the brewing technology is awesome for this ! I never have to worry about a trace of coffee in any of my tea drinks . Overall , I 've had an awesome experience with this brewer and because I registered my brewer with Keurig online , I 'm getting a ton of incredible deals on k-cups , including rewards for writing this very review ( which did n't affect my opinion about this brewer in any way , shape , or form ) . Thanks , Keurig , for the free pods for this review !#### #### ####[([60], [63], 'POS'), ([47], [50], 'POS')]
To my shame , I have never used a zester before . I have always thought that there is n't really much difference between a ( cheese ) grater and a zester . But when I tried to zest some lemon using my cheese grater , all I ended up with was a lot of oil resulted from the zest and not as much zest , because the wholes are too small and not suitable for citrus peel . I have also used the small part of a standard grater , but again , the wholes are too small and the result is different from the one obtained with a zester. < br />< br /> This product was a pleasant surprise . I had no idea it was so easy to create lemon zest . It only takes 1-2 seconds , so you have to pay attention because the zester gets to white bitter part of the lemon very quickly . With a grater , I had to grate the same area several times to get some zest . The zester is a lot faster and the result is long beautiful shreds of lemon peel . I absolutely love the flavor of lemon and orange peel in baked goods . For Christmas and Easter I bake a sweet bread filled with walnuts , cocoa or chocolate and raisins and I always add zest to the dough . This tool will come in handy. < br />< br /> If you are using this for citrus , make sure you buy unwaxed fruit , because standard citrus fruit are coated with a layer of wax to last longer. < br />< br /> You can use this zester for garlic as well , although I recently got a garlic press , so I wo n't risk shredding my fingers. < br />< br /> I used this for Parmesan cheese and it grates the cheese very fast and as long as you have a big chunk and watch your fingers , it seems to do a better job than a grater . I have also used it to grate nutmeg and ginger . This is especially great because I could never get good results with a grater . Ginger is a very fibrous plant , so it get stuck on to the grater and it is impossible to clean . I did n't have this problem with the zester , probably because the holes are a different shape than those of a cheese grater. < br />< br /> In case you are wondering , I use grated ginger to make ginger infused water . It tastes good and it is also great for oral hygiene . I learned about it long ago when I had sensitive gums that were occasionally bleeding and rinsing with ginger water made my problem go away. < br />< br /> The product is made from stainless steel , which makes for a great quality product . The handle is plastic , but I do n't remember seeing zesters that have a handle from a different material , so I assume plastic is resistant enough for a zesting job . Remember to use a gentle detergent and non-scratch sponge when washing stainless steel utensils and dry them immediately so they do n't get stained . The zester 's teeth are very sharp , so use with caution . It comes with a protection plastic cover , which is useful , since you do n't want to get scratched when grabbing the zester out of your drawer . The product is just a bit longer than some of my utensils , but if you store it in a utensil holder or on a hook on the wall , it is not an issue. < br />< br /> I like the product and I ca n't believe I 've baked for so many years and never used a zester before . I thought it was one of those tools that you can live without , but it 's actually really useful and makes your life easier. < br />< br /> NOTE : I received this product free in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.ginger to make ginger infused water .

LOVE , LOVE , LOVE . I had forgotten how good fresh garlic really is ! ! We used one clove on our salad and green beans today and it was so good . The aroma was very delightful . I am getting hungry again just talking about it I had doubts in the beginning like will this really work , how much will it waste , and can you really use the whole clove peel and all ? ! I was impressed with all answers . I used a large clove and it pressed it all down and out . I did remove most of the peel because I did not want that in my food and I was unsure of where it would go . It is easy to clean too because it all comes apart . Its made out of high quality heavy duty steel and I do n't foresee any part breaking .

These are cheaper than some others ( e.g. Tovolo ) and have space for 8 cubes instead of 6 , but they 're made of a thicker silicone so that when frozen they turn into bricks . Extracting the cubes is only possible with considerable effort . Each tray contains the following note , &# 34 ; please run the [ sic ] water on top of the tray before remove [ sic ] the ice cubes &# 34 ; so it 's obviously not an unknown issue for the company . The problem , of course , is that wetting down the cubes is messy and makes them incredibly slippery . What if you only want two cubes ? Wetting the top of the tray and placing it back in the freezer only makes a stronger brick the next time you take it out , too . I wo n't be buying any more of these . It 's a great idea , poorly executed .#### #### ####[([48], [42], 'NEU'), ([12], [2], 'NEU')]
Worked well on all my knives and I use several on a daily basis , since I have fresh vegtables as part of a cooperative with a local organic farmer. < br /> Having a sharp knife is very important , since we want to enjoy all of the vegtables @ their peak and this knife sharpener allows us to do so. < br /> Thank you for providing a quality produc @ a resonable cost .#### #### ####[([21], [18], 'POS')]

I love MyColdCup : it proved to be useful in many ways , aesthetically pleasant , and very convenient to take care of . I have been using it during the last school year for my son 's every day cold milk , cold smoothies , and warm camomile-honey teas . I was so happy I could create a mix of chocolate and white milk at home and it could stay nice and cold throughout school hours . My son loves his blue cup , it is very nice to hold in a small hand , easy to handle the lid , and it never leaks . It is also very convenient to wash even by hand , and after dishwasher the colour is still bright and shiny .

[[ VIDEOID : e3f3c1e82c045d9eb76b33996b4362fe ]] Included with the digital thermometer are the instructions , the transmitter stand and the probe with an approximate 3 foot 2 inch cable . Two AAA batteries are required for the thermometer display and two are required for the base transmitter but not included . The instructions are basic but cover the details for use pretty well aside from a misspelling or two . There is no warranty information indicated in the instructions for this thermometer. < br />< br /> The thermometer and transmitter stand both have grey plastic casings . The thermometer is lightweight but feels fairly well made . The transmitter has a power switch on the bottom and the thermometer display has the power switch on the back . Both power switches are fairly small though and I would like them to be a bit larger for easier use . I found the battery cover on the back of the thermometer display a bit difficult to remove . The battery cover could use some ridges for easier removal . Once powered on the transmitter starts flashing a red LED that indicates that it is transmitting. < br />< br /> The thermometer has a nice large display with a blue backlight that includes the meat selection , wellness level , target temperature , current temperature and timer . The display is clear and easy to see at certain angles but fades and is hard to see in certain positions . The blue backlight also tends to wash out the top of the display . The front of the thermometer has several buttons including the mode for C / F , meat selector , taste selector , clear , minute / second buttons and start / stop . The top of the thermometer display also has a light button , which for some reason when pressed it lights up and also changes the taste setting . Not sure why it does that . With the exception of the light button , the buttons are also a bit small and crowded together and I would like to see them a bit bigger but they work. < br />< br /> The back of the thermometer has a clip for wearing on the belt or shirt and the range of the thermometer is good indicating in the instructions it is capable of reading at nearly 100 feet ( the Amazon page says 65 feet ) . I walked about 50 feet away and the indicator read the temperature with no issue . Because this relies on the transmitter base , I would have liked if they had included a plug for using the probe directly into the thermometer , just in case the base goes bad. < br />< br /> At the right angle , the screen is easy to read with lots of cooking options . Unlike another thermometer I recently tried , the meat presets for this thermometer are accurate . There is also a manual mode for setting your own temperature but doing this is n't as easy as some thermometers I have used . The thermometer does not have a memory for any settings ( i.e. you have to change to F each time you turn on ) and there is no way to save the manual temperature settings. < br />< br /> The cooking temperatures seem to be fairly accurate within a degree or two from other thermometers I compared it , which I consider reasonable for cooking . The temperature alarm is loud enough to alert you and sounds accurately when the desired temperature is reached. < br />< br /> The temperature probe for this thermometer has an approximately 3 foot long cord appears to be a fairly standard one for this type of thermometers . Having used quite a few of these over the years , I have learned that you have to treat the probe wires delicately and not bend or pinch them or they will quickly fail and this probe has to be treated in a similar manner. < br />< br /> This wireless thermometer seems to be accurate in its temperatures and with its presets , has a good range and seems to be well made . The display is large and easy to read but at certain angles fades . The backlight is a bit too bright at the top and also makes the top of the display hard to read and for some reason also changes the taste selection when pressed . The buttons are a bit small and crowded . There is no warranty information for this thermometer , leading me to believe the warranty is 90 days or less. < br />< br /> 4 stars < br />< br /> I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review . I do not promise a good rating in return , nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way .

While we bought this mainly for commercial uses involving restaurant equipment , we 've bee quite pleased with the responsiveness and accuracy in our initial at home testing . I was unsure how one might put this to use outside of commercial applications but we 've actually found multiple uses for it at home . Kitchen uses include checking surface temperature for internal meat temperatures , gauging temperature for yogurt cultures in the process of making at-home-yogurt , and logging the various stages of yeast in bread making . Around the house uses include checking pipes for water temperature ( obviously this cannot read inside the pipes but can help track hot water flow and be valuable in logging frozen pipe progression ,) monitoring PC surface and hard drive temperatures for signs of overheating , taking engine temperatures , and identifying leaks and issues with indoor heating / cooling vents and systems . But , if you 're here , you likely already have an intended use in mind , so let 's get to the nitty-gritty :< br />< br />* If you are new to infrared thermometers then you will need to understand that , while the laser is useful in helping to pinpoint the temperature reading location it is NOT the source of readings or the spot where the reading is most accurately pulled from . For the most intuitive and accurate guns you will likely want a dual laser - where the reading is taken from the surface between the two points on the projected surface . In this case the laser is top located and the readings are incrementally below the projected laser dot. < br />< br />* Keep in mind , while this can be helpful in cooking it should not be relied upon over an internal temperature probe . It is only useful in measuring surface temperatures . While thickness and cooking speed varies by cut and type of meat , you can estimate internal temperature by surface temperature but it 's really not the most accurate if that 's your sole purchase in owning this gun . Stick to surface temperatures and in cases where fractions of a degree are notated for important measurements , refer to the manufacturer 's surface guide . Different types of surfaces minimally impact the accuracy of readings . This is not a reflection of this particular unit 's efficacy , but something to take into account as , for example , shiny surfaces such as stainless steel tend to reflect ambient surrounding temperatures rather than the physical material temperature . ( If that sounds like gibberish , hot stainless steel will read lower in temperature than true surface temperature due to it 's physical properties , so take this into account when measuring for the most accurate notations. )< br />< br />* Not to beat a dead horse , but off of the above , I could not find a way to set emissivity which is preset to the common - 0.95 for most organic surface and painted surface readings . Some more advanced thermo guns will allow you to adjust emissivity to better account for the above mentioned concept. < br />< br />* Scanning surfaces provides a pretty accurate live measurement of temperature - Remember to point the gun towards a neutral surface before pointing it at ( scanning it over to ) the desired measured surface . This will provide the most accurate reading . I did note that the further away I got the accuracy decreased by a few degrees . I found most accurate readings were less than 18 &# 34 ; from the measured surface. < br />< br />* One quarm I have about this unit is that it times out pretty fast after measurements . As it does n't store measurements , you have to be pretty quick with notations , should you plan on using this to record regular temperature readings. < br />< br />* This unit includes a 9 volt battery , which it runs off - The battery compartment is hidden behind that black piece below the trigger . It is a bit of a pain to open up and still takes me a while to work open . When one side breaks free the other seals tight - there just is no simple way to pinch both tabs and open them at once. < br />< br />* The ability to turn the backlight on or off and the automatic low battery warning are nice energy saving convenience features for the user. < br />< br /> In all , this unit was providing us with surface measurements accurate to . 4 -. 6 degree ( F ) range at 18 &# 34 ; distance on hot and cold surfaces . The laser indicator seems to be just above the read point at this distance and we are quite pleased with the speed of reading ( we simply wish there was a way to keep the reading on the gun longer . ) If you are looking for an affordable pyrometer for around the house and general DIY uses this is more than accurate enough and easy to use . For more precision work and pinpoint measurements ( where fractions of temporal variance matters ) you might want to look for a unit with dual lasers and emissivity settings. < br />< br /> We received a discount on this item in hopes we would share our insight and honest opinion , which we have done.saving convenience features for the user .

Updated review - as several others have said , the bottles start to leak after awhile . In my case it 's through the vent as far as I can tell . When my daughter sets her backpack down at school the bottle slowly empties itself on the floor unless it is standing straight up . If I fill them and hold them upside down , water drips out of the vent .

I was a little skeptical prior to making this purchase , but I thought &# 34 ; hey what the heck if I do n't like it amazon offers money back , plus at this price what do I have to lose ?&# 34 ; As soon as I received my product in the mail , I put it to use . It 's so easy to use , fool-proof . Simple directions , sturdy product , looks sleek in the kitchen . I like the combo of black / red . My first impressions of the kitchen knife sharpener were great , but I did n't write a review till now simply because I felt I needed a week or so to really use the product properly and see how well it holds up and sharpens my cutlery . To be honest , I do n't think I could ask for a better knife sharpener . I was always a bit intimidated by knife sharpening products because well I thought they would involve a complicated process and I also thought that they are not a necessity but after using this I realized how wrong my assumptions were . I have old knives like maybe 3 years old that I never bothered sharpening and they had gotten really dull and I was about to replace them but now I do n't need to because this product made them super sharp ! I really , really hope it holds up well over time because for now I 'm one happy customer . Good product , highly recommend !#### #### ####[([97], [93], 'POS')]

I purchased these for myself because I am terrible at using chopsticks and I always have to endure the shame and sideways glances that go with having to ask for a fork whenever we go out to certain restaurants . I felt a little silly using them at first , but then I had some wine and did n't have to ask for a fork , so it was all good after that . These were really easy to use , although the plastic they are made from makes them a little slippery with sushi sometimes . I thought they were really easy to wash , but I think hand washing was recommended on the packaging . I have n't tried to wash them in the dishwasher yet .

This year in our garden we decided to keep it simple and planted only two herbs . We planted Sweet Basil and an Italian Oregano . I love to cook with fresh herbs but where I live it gets very cold for over half the year so instead of using fresh herbs we opt instead to dry them. < br /> Usually we pick a day after everything has dried out and we use our hands , in a friction manner , to ground the herbs , and then put them in their jars. < br /> That is , until I received my Herb Grinder in the mail . The 3 &# 34 ; Herb Grinder by KingTop is the first time I 've ever used anything like this. < br /> It makes breaking up the herbs so easy and relatively mess free . The four pieces each screw together tightly and with its small but mighty look you would be surprised by the weight it packs. < br /> I recommend washing the pieces well before starting because there was some oil residue but it 's metal and that can be expected . The oil came off and now it 's clean as a whistle. < br /> The compartments fascinated me and once my hubby showed me how to work it I became an old pro within minutes , and the smell that is produced from the crushed herbs is just absolutely Devine . I felt like I needed to stop and make spaghetti right then and there !< br /> I know they make a larger size as well as this 3 &# 34 ; but this fits in my hand nicely so before purchasing figure out what works best for you because I really like the size of my Herb Grinder. < br /> I was able to purchase my Herb Grinder by KingTop at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion .#### #### ####[([122], [121], 'POS'), ([32], [23], 'POS'), ([159], [158], 'POS'), ([127], [121], 'POS')]
I 've used 10-15 nutmeg graters over the years ( think eggnog ) . This is without a doubt the best one I 've ever used . It is very high quality , easy to use , and produces an amazing fine grated nutmeg . I am extremely happy with it and have purchased a couple as presents for family . About the only thing I can complain about is the bottom of the unit , which is used to cover the output blades , was initially difficult to remove and we were confused by it . But I 'm nitpicking . I 've seen the price for it fluctuate as it goes in and out of stock from various venders but it is worth the wait .#### #### ####[([43], [40], 'POS'), ([31], [33], 'POS'), ([71], [63], 'POS')]

Updated review , July 30 , 2016 I 've had this can opener for not quite a year . I 've been glad to have it but today when I went to use it , it barely worked .

Once you get the hang of it , this product does its job ... for bottles . I used it to remove bottle bottoms for an art project , so my score lines were about 1 cm from the bottom of the bottles . What worked for me : Score the bottle with an oiled blade , and do not overlap your score . Pour boiling water over the score for about 10 seconds while rotating the bottle for even heating . You do not need to fill the bottle with anything , just heat the outside . Then move the bottle to an ice bath for about 10 seconds ( again , not necessary to put any liquid into the bottle ) . Then back to the boiling water . Keep the bottle near the floor of your sink so the piece that falls off does n't fall too far and break . You can put a towel or a mat in the bottom of your sink to cushion the fall . It was during this 2nd boiling water stage that the bottles came apart at my score mark , most of the time quite neatly . If it is not neat , you can try giving what needs to come off a tap with the tapper , but results were much less reliable . Wear safety glasses and gloves. < br />< br /> Jars : I tried to use this on a jar by drilling a hole in the jar lid ( as recommended by the manufacturer ) for the device to sit in , but as soon as I started putting pressure on the blade , the hole in the jar lid started warping and there was no way to get a straight score .#### #### ####[([188], [191], 'POS')]

Unusual name for a company Blue Avocado … but whatever works ?! ? I am delighted to be the proud owner of these re-usable and freezable short term storage bags . No more Ziploc bags for me given the fact they ’re not BPA-free , and the Blue Avocado line is . Cross contamination is no laughing matter , so avoid using these with foods where that ’s possible like with meats unless you mark the bags . Also avoid using with foods that stain , unless you do n’t mind discoloration of your bags . Considerable effort is needed to open and close these bags once in the freezer . Cooking food in the bags is not recommended , as they ’re not designed to take that abuse . $ 20 is a bit pricy for 4 different size bags , and if you wish to add some additional sizes , expect to pay an additional $ 30-60 for several additional sizes . I suspect and hope prices will come down as demand may increase over time , because I really need more gallon sizes . Even though Blue Avocado is a bit late to the BPA-free party , I ’m glad they ’re around . This is what short term food storage is supposed to look like .#### #### ####[([34], [32], 'POS'), ([212], [202], 'POS'), ([150], [160], 'POS')]

This is my second Moccamaster coffee maker . The first was a Moccamaster CDT , which I purchased in 2008 . It stopped working ( likely the heating element ) and we immediately purchased another one to replace the old .

It comes with both the brew-through cap and the solid cap , it does n't have a selector switch for whole pot , half-pot , or stop brew , the styling on the front of water tower is different , and it does n't have the plastic plate under the coffee pot ( or my husband threw it away when he unpacked the box ) .#### #### ####[([101], [94], 'POS')]

This knife sharpener is small and compact but boy , does it do a great job of sharpening knives .

It looks good among the other red stoneware and cast iron pieces I already own such as Le Creuset , Rachel Ray and KitchenAid . It appears to be well made though I wish the lid did not have so much room to slide around . It does n't have much of a seal to speak of . It is generously sized and will hold 10 &# 34 ; tortillas very easily. < br />< br /> Since it 's stoneware and in an expensive price range , I had hoped it would be a good multipurpose item . It is microwave and dishwasher safe and can be heated in an oven up to 425 degrees . There are no handles to lift it with so I really would n't suggest using it at the top end of its heat range for cooking . It would be fine as a casual casserole pan in the 350 degree or lower heat range . I 've only used it to heat and reheat tortillas .#### #### ####[([34], [32], 'POS'), ([25], [33], 'POS'), ([38], [29], 'POS'), ([183], [177], 'POS'), ([179], [185], 'POS')]

Not only am I bringing a long beverages in these flasks that give me the liquid courage I need to wrestle bears and forage for wild truffles .

My daughter loved her new school lunch box . It very sharp in person , and it appears to be quite durable . It is also quite large . Which is great for a large water bottle , snack , and her lunch .

So far so good . I have used the pan for a couple of months and it performs very well . I always use a little fat when sauteing and nothing sticks . I have used it for bacon and eggs , a variety of other proteins , vegetables , french toast , quesadillas etc. < br />< br /> Just read the directions and follow common sense for non-stick pans . Never use metal utensils ; take it off the heat when done ; wash with a little soap on a sponge when cool ( do not put cold water into a hot pan to soak ).< br />< br /> I have thrown away a number of previous non-stick pans for various reasons when they became unusable . I am hoping this one lasts a very long time .#### #### ####[([117], [119], 'POS'), ([134], [128], 'POS')]
Ok , so there are pros and cons to these . They work great for me . My 9 month old son wo n't use a sippy cup but drinks from these , and loves it .

Really cheap as others have mentioned . I make pickles in large batches ( about 20 mason jars at a time ) and my first time using it the metal holder started to rust .

If you are a wine drinker like me , this is a very handy gadget to have around the house. < br />< br /> I have had countless bottles of wine , that I ended up pouring down the drain because when I tried to re-cork them and opened them up later on to enjoy , they just did not have a pleasant taste at all . This little wine saver pump is an awesome fix for that problem !< br />< br /> It 's relatively simple to use , all you have to do is put the rubber topper into the neck of the bottle and then use the hand pump to remove the remaining air and create a nice , tight seal . Once this is done , the flavor will remain the same and then I can open the bottle up whenever I am ready to enjoy it again . I received one to review , and l love it . This is such an affordable way to keep my wine tasting just as good as when it was first opened . I definitely will be ordering a few more to give out as gifts to my fellow wine lovers this Christmas !#### #### ####[([203], [193], 'POS')]
We have been using our popcorn maker for some time now , and we really enjoy it . The popcorn it produces is much more similar to &# 34 ; movie theater &# 34 ; type popcorn than any other at home method that we have tried ( microwave , air , etc. ) . It is very good popcorn . The machine itself is pretty good quality , especially for the price . We have not had any issues . I get the &# 34 ; all in one &# 34 ; kits with seasoning , oil , and corn from Great Northern here on Amazon . Overall , an attractive looking machine that makes very good popcorn. < br />< br /> A couple of issues that I will mention though . It is difficult to load this thing . You move the cover of the pan / heating bucket up a rod to load the machine with oil / corn / etc ... . it is high on the machine and somewhat difficult to get to . This is to the point where I wonder if I 'm doing something wrong ? ? The other issue that I have is the amount of corn that does not pop .

These refillable cups are great . I love my keurig but not how wasteful the pods are .

Not that great . After 8 months of use , the lid on one of my containers is so cracked that sharp pieces of it are now chipping off . It 's basically shattered just from the stress of opening and closing it . This container is one that I open and close at least twice a day . After about 3 months I noticed long cracks in the plastic lid ... and now it 's just falling apart . The other containers that do n't get as much use are also showing some small cracks but not as bad . I would not purchase this product again .

This vegetable spiral slicer is a simple and compact device that can be run through a dishwasher after use and then tossed in a drawer. < br />< br /> It works like a crayon sharpener , except that the shavings are also sliced into strips . One side cuts thinner and narrower strips , while the other makes thicker and wider strips. < br />< br /> The length of the strips obtained depends on the density and firmness of the vegetable being cut . Zucchini and cucumbers work best . Carrots and potatoes come out much shorter and are sometimes difficult to turn in the cones . Celery does n't work at all . I have n't tried anything mushy like a tomato. < br />< br /> The metal plates on the outside look like blades , but they function as stiffeners and handles . There is a lid with spikes to hold stubby vegetables and it works okay with ends of carrots or leftover bits of potato . There is inevitably a bit or two with any type of slicer that wo n't go through. < br />< br /> The blades are very sharp , so keep the slicer away from children. < br />< br /> Accessories included are a small brush for cleaning the blades and central core , a drawstring storage bag , and a peeler with a plastic blade. < br />< br /> Best4UWorldwide provided a spiral slicer for evaluation and review .#### #### ####[([251], [246], 'POS'), ([53], [57], 'POS')]

Gorman is a division of the Lenox Corporation that sells cookware including cast iron pots , pans , and cooking utensils . Rick Bayless is a chef famous for his cooking , writing , and restaurants focusing in part on Mexican cuisine . The Mexican Kitchen line by Rick Bayless offers a slotted food turner is great for saut & eacute ; ing and serving dishes associated with dining south of the border . The spatula is 14in long , great for use with large pots . The turner has a red silicone wrapped handle 6in long that has small raised bumps that provide a good grip . There is a hole at the end of the handle that allows for hanging on a hook ready to grab and use . The last inch of the silicone wrap is flexible with no wood within. < br />< br /> The spatula is made of Beachwood with a smooth surface that is safe to use with non-stick cooking surfaces . The spatula has a slight upward curve that tapers from . 25in to a sharp end making it sturdy and easy to cook with food in a flat pan , especially heavy portions of meats . Two 1.75in slots provide for draining of sauces and easy stirring of cooking ingredients . I use the turner most of the time while cooking preferring it to other spatulas that I have . I wash the spatula by hand although there is no instruction related to dishwasher use . Wood utensils seem to be popular with professional chefs today , and I have found this to be an excellent cooking utensil for home cooking .#### #### ####[([30], [40], 'POS'), ([203], [196], 'POS'), ([252], [262], 'POS')]

I have used the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for several years at home with great success . With the implementation of Common Core Standards it only seemed logical that teaching the youth of our nation the benefits of Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer should be added to the Common Core Curriculum . Upon petitioning the Common Core advisory council for inclusion of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer into the standards , it was brought to my attention that a banana has no core and therefore does not meet the stringent requirements set forth for all American Youth . What 's next ? Eliminating cursive writing instruction ? Not saying the Pledge of Allegiance each morning ? Eliminating chalkboards ? Keep America strong parents and purchase a Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for home instruction . You are the most important influence in their life .

This product is superior . The instruction manual provided is one of the best I 've ever used to fully understand the workings of a device . We followed the directions to a T , and the spring rolls and French fries were the best we 've had at home . The filtering system for the used oil is great , and easy to perform . I used the dishwasher for all parts except the electrical heating instrument and the overall container . Do not immerse the heating element in water ! The outside container is too large for our dishwasher , but it remains almost oil-free after use , so it 's easy to hand wash . Important : Do not use these devices with an extension cord . The wattage required is greatly reduced . Most of these devices' owners manuals clearly state that . I believe this is the first time I paid attention to that no-no , and the T-fal deep fryer worked better than any I previously used .

This is n't my first Freshware , and to tell you the truth , UI would n't have bought this if I had desiraqble options. < br />< br /> You see , after baking in Freshware , there 's a white powdery residue . It 's almost impossible to get rid of it with a washrag and Dawn , because when you press against Freshware with the washrag or brush , it squirrels out from under , As far as I can tell , it 's not affecting the flavor or taste of my baked goods , nor is it likely to be a health risk . I suspect it 's mostly flour , but I do n't know , and it 's the uncertainty that bothers me. < br />< br /> Oh,the lack of options ? A 3-cup-of-flour dough will make a round loaf in a dutch oven , or a rectangular loaf . It will make a dozen rolls in a cupcake tin . It will make four loaves that are * perfect * for slider sandwiches . Kids love pb & j sliders , or grilled cheese sliders , and adults seem to favor them as well . But a hanburger slider is too doggoned small , and a full size loaf is too buig a burger unless you 're hugely hungry . This pan lets me split the dough recipe in six and make hamburger buns. < br />< br /> Oh , it 's not perfect for that . You ger a squat mushroom shape . Still , they work adequately well . Surely , you say , there are other baking tins for making burgewr buns . Yeppers . Chicago Metallic makes one that looks like it 'd be wonderful , but it 's too big for my &# 34 ; apartment-size &# 34 ; oven , and I 'd have to buy a dozen pans , which is overkill for this widower living alone. < br />< br /> And if you 're reading this as someone from a baking tin company ( are you insulted , Freshware , if I call your floppy baking pan &# 34 ; tins &# 34 ;? Sorry !) you need to add two items to your line . One is a pan with six long cavities for baking hoagy rolls , and the other would have a dozen long cavities for breadsticks . Yes , they both can be baked on a cookie sheet , but it 's easier to get a uniform appearance with a baking tin . Just keep it to 14 &# 34 ; x14 &# 34 ; and sell the , by the &# 34 ; each &# 34 ;.< br />< br /> The cavities here are about 2,75 inches in diameter but the bread dough bulges to give a nice mushroom = shaped burger bun . Remember the Seinfeld episode with &# 34 ; Top of The Muffin &# 34 ; ? This would be great for that. < br />< br /> Whoopie pies , too . This is * exactly * the sight size . But you only get three whoopie pies from six cavities , and you 're supposed to let stuff cool in the freshware tins , so you might want to buy 6 or 8 tins . I find it 's easiest to use a pizza peel to put freshware into or out of a hot oven. < br />< br /> A few years ago , I discovered a company that made peanut prittle in pie pans , and sold the round , unbroken , wrapped in heavy saran , instead of breaking the brittle up and hiding it in a box . I 'd think this woulde be wonderful for making a smaller version , which could be sold to kids at a school carnival , or something like that . Peanut brittle is pretty easy to make , is universally appealing , and with no boxes to buy , would be pretty cheap to make . I 've not tried it yet , though. < br />< br /> I 'm not thrilled by this item . I 'd rather have a cavity about 3.25 &# 34 ; diameter , and as I said , I 'd rather have steel . On the other hand , I 'm satisfied enough that I plan on buying a second one , and possibly getting three more , for whoopie4 pie or peanut brittle use .

The cutter does a fine job so long as you take your time and do n't force the ears through it . The blades are not strong enough to cut through the cob , this is what causes the blades to bend . I found this out the hard way . To help control the cutter , I notched the top of a 2 gallon bucket and rested the cutter , serrated side up in the notches . ( Not my idea , saw it on a website . ) This worked very well so long as I did n't push to hard and stopped and restarted when the ear started to bind . I managed to strip about 10 dozen ear in about an hour with very little mess . I think the bucket is the trick and the bucket did a great job of catching the kernels .#### #### ####[([49], [48], 'POS'), ([32], [26], 'POS'), ([144], [143], 'POS'), ([129], [128], 'POS'), ([134], [128], 'POS')]

We have two sets of these , and they are my favorite measuring cups . Not only is it nice to have metal with etched measurements that do n't wash off , but the short handles make it a lot easier to get into the bottom of cannisters to fill them up .

Started out okay , but really does n't cut it . There is little to no variability in setting your grind .

I purchased this device because I will be smoking sausage . The internal temp must reach 155 to be safe for consumption . Higher than that will cause the sausage to be dry . My team is entering a competition with the sausage recipe . I tested it on tap water and on food reheated in the microwave . It very quickly registered the temp and I could hold the reading with the provided button. < br />< br /> I feel this is the perfect solution to safe cooking. < br />< br /> Thank you very much ,< br />< br /> Clay Allison#### #### ####[([89], [85], 'POS'), ([13], [12], 'POS'), ([9], [12], 'POS'), ([9], [19], 'POS')]

Easier to hold then the classic corn-shaped ones , and they seem to stay in better too ( sometimes a little too well ) .

Everything is great about the jars . It 's my fault for not looking at the picture closer , but I thought you could put the straw through the lid .

I 've been starting to use silicone in the kitchen because of how easy it is to store and of how well it works . This is my first time using a silicone baking tray but I love it ! It can be baked in heats up to 464 degrees Fahrenheit , so this is basically safe for anything I 'll ever cook !< br />< br /> It is made of a food-grade silicone and is flexible , making it able to be stored anywhere . This mat has hundreds of pyramid shaped triangles to allow drainage for fat and oil to comes out of food . We eat a lot of lean proteins such as fish and chicken in my house so having this remove extra fat and grease is so helpful !< br />< br /> FIRST TIME USE : Before I used it for baking , I followed the instructions and put the silicone mat in the oven for about 10 minutes at 225 degrees to rid it of the silicone smell. < br />< br /> SIZE : This baking mat is 16 &# 34 ; by 11 &# 34 ; , but can easily be trimmed with scissors if you need to fit it inside a smaller baking tray !< br />< br /> I decided to bake fish on it , so I put the mat in a baking tray and placed frozen fish on it with some seasoning ( no oil ) and baked it at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes . Upon removing it from the oven , I could see the excess water and fat at the base of the mat ! The fish tasted great and was not dried out at all , either !< br />< br /> This is also dishwasher safe ! I washed it in the dishwasher after cooking and it came out just fine ! No melting , no discoloration-looked brand new !< br />< br /> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and feedback . My opinions are 100 % my own but I 'm sure that this will be enjoyed by anyone who wants to eat cleaner , eat less fat and reduce their calorie intake ! As a bonus you can also use this as a cooling rest !#### #### ####[([33], [28], 'POS')]

** update - I just want to update a year later to say , these clips are the best thing that have ever happen to my household . I absolutely love them . Chips have seriously , no lie , lasted MONTHS with this on it . I fold the bag catercorner on both sides , then fold down and clip . I 'm so glad that I was able to receive this. < br />< br /> These clips are great . They have been keeping the chips in the house really fresh . I plan to use some of them on my cereal bags as well . They close up really tight and do n't let any air in . If I could give one suggestion it would be for them to be the complete length of a chip bag . They are a little short and I have to fold the chip bag , which makes it a little difficult to close . However , with that being said , I still think it 's a 5 star product bc maybe I should have ordered a bigger size if they have one . As far as how well they work , they work great !

Still , that turns out to not be that big of deal when they can be so quickly reheated in the same container . The main downsides of the Norpro is that it 's not very attractive , and it 's basically a one-trick pony. < br />< br /> I use the simple method of a slightly damp , clean kitchen towel with tortillas wrapped inside , within the tortilla holder . Then pop the whole thing in the microwave for 1:30-2:00 for warm , steamed tortillas . The Norpro works great with that method and , if the tortillas cool off , I just throw the whole thing back in the microwave for another 30-45 seconds. < br />< br /> Still , despite being mostly happy with the much less expensive plastic Norpro , I was wooed by this super pretty stoneware holder that looks identical to one I ’ve admired for a while in Williams-Sonoma , though that was n’t the Bayless brand model. < br />< br /> This bright red piece is heavy-duty , dishwasher safe glazed stoneware ( interior is cream colored ) , but much shorter than the Norpro , making it hard to fit a useful amount of tortillas , plus the damp towel inside . It also suffered from becoming a bit too hot to handle when I tried to microwave — though it is perfectly microwave safe — it for as long as I was used to heating the Norpro for. < br />< br /> Not , burn-yourself hot , but a little warm for comfortable bare-handed handling , and I feared someone dropping the hot ( ish ) stoneware lid and breaking it . Of course , it does cool down relatively quickly (&# 62 ; 5 min. ) , so this is a fairly minor concern. < br />< br /> I did find a few easy workarounds for actually warming tortillas by my preferred method in this … First , I ditched the towel altogether and just misted the tortilla stack itself lightly before putting the lid on . This made the top tortilla a tiny bit soggier than I prefer , but left the others nicely fresh and steamed , though the warmer itself still got a little hotter than I ’d like. < br />< br /> Next , I went back to the damp towel , but just set it on a plate to warm , and then transferred the tortillas to the Bayless warmer for serving . This method worked quite well , in that the tortillas warmed / steamed even faster than in the Norpro , and the Bayless stoneware kept them warm longer once inside , but was still cool to the touch for serving. < br />< br /> The other option is placing it in a warm oven (~ 200 degrees ) , something the plastic Norpro ca n’t do , to hold pancakes or already steamed tortillas at temp until serving . I found this very handy when serving for a crowd. < br />< br /> It could also be used , unlike a dedicated tortilla warmer , for a covered casserole , or other general serving options , making this one a bit more multi-purpose , which I liked. < br />< br /> All in all , this a lovely piece , that does work for its intended purpose , as so do lesser priced options . Still , this is a beautiful bit of serveware I ’m happy to have.er , but left the others nicely fresh and steamed , though the warmer itself still got a little hotter than I ’d like .

This coupon holder is taller and wider than my previous which is nice for longer coupons . I like that it will stand up on the table and has sturdy card stock . I use a few different categories than the preprinted labels so I simply used a label maker to make my own . I purchased the flower design and I love that it is bright which will diminish the chances of leaving it behind in the carriage . I also like the fact it is nylon and can be easily cleaned .#### #### ####[([38], [37], 'POS'), ([26], [29], 'POS'), ([2], [6], 'POS')]

I bought this because I really got tired of purchasing Starbucks coffee at 5 dollars a cup . One of the best things about Starbucks coffee is that the whip cream stays and does not dissolve . I found mine at home dissolves fast when I used the whip cream from the can . I watched the Barista at Starbucks do the whip cream noticed a can like this one . Once I decided to start making coffee on my own I bought this product and I 'm glad I did . It was a great purchase especially because they have the N2O charges to create the whip cream . It really made thick nice whip cream without the added sugar from the already made can in the store .#### #### ####[([116], [113], 'POS'), ([107], [113], 'POS'), ([14], [7], 'POS')]

Not worth the price ... but it 's okay . Take my advice -- stick with a less expensive blender ... they do the same job . The lids are a nice feature ( for saving a smoothie you did n't finish ) but honestly this product is WAY over-priced . If you do purchase it , be sure to use the tightening tool BEFORE placing the container on top of the base . If you tighten the top by hand only it will leak and make a huge mess . Also -- be sure to let your smoothie sit for a minute or two before using the tool to take the lid off .#### #### ####[([102], [94], 'NEU'), ([12], [18], 'NEU'), ([89], [88], 'NEU'), ([63], [58], 'NEU')]

I was in need of a new coffee mug , but due to my illness - complex regional pain syndrome - I had to be specific . This mug met all my requirements . It keeps my coffee hot for hours , I can close it so if it falls ( which , typically it does now ) nothing spills at all , it fits perfectly in my Keurig , I can also make iced tea in it which then stays cool for hours , it fits in my car cup holder , the lid comes off easily , and most important for me is the handle . The handle is easy to grip and hold onto .#### #### ####[([7], [17], 'POS'), ([28], [25], 'POS'), ([90], [81], 'POS'), ([91], [101], 'POS')]

These are the worst ice cube trays I have ever seen ! When brand new , the cubes stuck a little , but after a few cycles of use , in borders on impossible to get the cubes out ! Twisting them , bending them back , smashing on a counter , nothing works well . The only way I have found that works at all is to run hot water over them , and then you have to melt about 25 % of your cubes in order to get them to release . BTW - these may be purchased cheaper at a major brick and mortar retailer , but even if you get them free , they are no bargain . If you are old enough to remember the old aluminum ones which were hard to get the cubes out of , well , these are worse ! I can only assume the positive reviews here are from people who either had not used them yet , or had only used them once or twice . Problem of getting the cubes out becomes much worse over time .#### #### ####[([17], [25], 'NEG'), ([26], [33], 'NEG')]

There are already a million glowing reviews , so I 'll keep it quick . I got my first Britta pitcher when I moved to Brooklyn in 1995 . It was one of the boxier , square-section ones , and served me well until someone broke it a couple of weeks ago . I ordered this one , assuming it would be the same size , but just a more convenient shape. < br />< br /> It 's actually much bigger ... maybe by 50 % , but because of the elongated shape it does n't take up much more useable room on the counter . The comfortable handle makes up for the added weight . It 's a big improvement. < br />< br /> FWIW , I use Britta filters to make water taste better , especially in coffee and tea . We have good water in NYC , but it 's often heavily chlorinated , and buildings often have old pipes that add rust and other mineral flavors . The carbon filters do a good job of removing all that . If I suspected anything dangerous in the water , I would opt for a more serious filtration system .#### #### ####[([164], [163], 'POS')]

Beko turkish < br /> I have been using this machine daily for the last 6 months . I LOVE IT . sometimes it is temperamental and the red light turns on instead of the expected Blue . But its only because I have not placed the container on the cradle security . Tree is only one way and it wo n't work or taste properly if its not in right . Other than that , the coffee is almost as good as the old fashioned way of making it. < br /> Beko people were kind enough to replace my first one after a couple of months usage and the light never urned on to let me know my coffee was ready .

Once the cups are dropped , or even set down too hard on a flat surface , the hinge on the lids often break and will no longer close . While the bubba website does sell replacement lids , that seems a giant waste of money and waiting for the lid to get shipped . I would rather invest in a better made more durable cup then be constantly replacing lids . I will not buy from bubba any longer .#### #### ####[([74], [71], 'NEG'), ([94], [93], 'NEG')]

Bought this over a crock pot based on Amazon customer reviews . I could n't be more pleased ! This little thing is a gem . The 4-quart is perfect for sharing dinner with my adolescent son then having a whole Tupperware full of food to freeze for later enjoyment . It is easy to clean , the brown / sauté feature is powerful and also good for boiling down too-runny soups etc , and the unit is no frills . It just does exactly what I need it to do . And a good price ! I have recommended this to family and friends who have also bought it and are equally impressed . Great product !#### #### ####[([61], [63], 'POS'), ([21], [20], 'POS'), ([71], [70], 'POS'), ([24], [17], 'POS')]
Very nice little spatula . It ought to get five stars but I just ca n't bring myself to do that because it 's so small . I know , I know , the measurements are given , and I do have a ruler ; honestly , I 've never seen such a petite spatula ( I know , it 's for cookies ) and so it did n't occur to me they even made them so small . So while that was my own mistake , the four stars is to alert others it 's not like other spatulas some of us over the age of 50 have ever seen . It 's the size of small cookies. < br />< br /> I do n't make cookies . It will flip and egg , if it 's not too soft . It will stir things in a pan that need turning . I still need an larger spatula .#### #### ####[([99], [98], 'POS'), ([34], [25], 'POS')]

My sister is always complaining about how bulky her other cupcake carrier is ( it 's 2 tiered ) . She bakes often but does n't make big batches of cupcakes so this carrier is great for her . It 's narrow so it fits perfectly at her side . It 's also really sturdy . It 's her dream carrier , so now I 'm waiting for her to shut up about how much she loves iy . She wants to buy a bunch more and in different colors. < br />< br /> It also fits in our fridge without any problems when before there would n't be enough space or she would have to just load up the carrier before leaving. < br />< br /> Awesome product .

It was ok for 6 months ... until the compressor died. < br />< br /> Pros :< br /> Works great , for 6 months. < br /> Door hinge can be adjusted to accommodate Coors kegs ( make sure door seal still seats properly , mine did , The CO2 tank did not fit in with the keg ).< br />< br /> Cons :< br /> Coors kegs do not fit at all with the CO2 tank. < br /> The included CO2 tankdoes not have a proper date code stamp or certification . Any reputable company that dispenses food quality CO2 ( FDA approved ) will not fill the canister . You will have to purchase a new one ( it still wo n't fit with a Coors keg ).< br /> Entire tap assembly ( valves , hoses , etc. ) is very cheap and easily damaged .

I had a smaller size of the same shaker . It was a good size , however we make our own salad dressing and we eat a lot of salad . It was a little small fit our needs . So we bought this larger size . The size is perfect . However the flip cap that is supposed to snap in place for secure closure does n't snap . It is somewhat loose , but it does n't leak . I turned out upside down to test if it will leak . But because of the loose feel , I ca n't just shake the salad dressing because I fear that the dressing that hits the cap will just move the cap out of it 's place and it will be spilled and sprayed everywhere . So I am having to be very careful using this salad dressing shaker . Hence the 3 stars . The smaller size we had snapped very securely . So the issue I described with the larger size maybe a fluke .#### #### ####[([38], [35], 'NEU'), ([21], [13], 'NEU')]

The Thermos ELEMENT5 16 ounce mug is the travel mug to buy !! ! This mug is all stainless steel , including the interior , where the food or drink constantly touches . It holds the temperature for hours ( as advertised ) . This mug has the simplest , most functional design of any mugs I reviewed . The silver stainless color will always remain the same even if it gets small scratches while being used . The main advantage is that It has a one-piece lid that is very easy to clean and dry and has no parts to break or get lost ( see below ).< br />< br /> I also bought the Thermos cranberry-red 16 ounce stainless steel King travel mug ( with handle ) . While I like the colored mug , it will probably get scratched over time . Both of the Thermos mugs hold the temperature for hours , and both of these mugs performed perfectly . Both have stainless steel interiors and exteriors where the drink is in constant contact . But the lid of the cranberry mug is made with 3 separate parts that have to be dissassembled in order to be cleaned and dried . One of the parts is very small and could be rinsed down a sink , making the mug lid unusable. < br />< br /> Buy the ELEMENT5 stainless steel travel mug instead .

We do n't have air conditioning in our place , and summers tend to be humid and sticky , so whenever either of us poured ourselves a cold drink it was n't long before it sweat right through the cork coasters we had been using . Since most of our furniture pieces ( desks , coffee table , night stand , side tables ) are wooden and were in danger of getting ruined , I went on the hunt for a set of coasters that would 1 ) prevent moisture from getting through and ruining our furniture , 2 ) more or less matched our decor / were n't an eyesore , and 3 ) were within our price range. < br />< br /> These Thirstystone coasters matched all of our requirements , and when they arrived , they performed admirably . They 've seen us through this summer and will continue to serve us for many more to come .

I 've had the unit for almost a month , and have used it A LOT processing garden veggies . I have not used the slicers or graters , just the chopping blade .

Love them . Worried about them breaking with the ice balls but drop the ice balls right above the lips . Ice lasts about 2-3 drinks depending on pour size . Very light weight . The inner glass has a cone bottom so thats nice. < br />< br /> Only negative its that lip of the glass is a little to thick but i would imagine any thinner you sacrifice strength and possible for breakage increases .#### #### ####[([54], [60], 'POS'), ([37], [36], 'POS'), ([37], [32], 'POS')]

I adore my Mr.Tea loose leaf tea strainer ! I have always wanted to try loose leaf tea , as I am an avid drinker of tea that I brew with tea bags . It always seemed a little too time consuming for me though. < br />< br /> I saw this cute way of straining loose leaf tea , and it was such a great price , I decided to give it a try on a whim . I am so glad that I did ! I am able to just fill up the bottom half with loose leaf tea leaves , and then just sit the little guy on the side of my mug . He looks so cute , almost like he is enjoying a little bubble bath :)< br />< br /> I highly recommend the Mr.Tea loose tea leaf strainer and I plan on getting some for my friend 's and son 's teachers for little Christmas gifts !

After One day of use Review !< br /> Order this last week and it can in on time . So far it works good. < br />< br /> The reason for my 4Star :< br /> The only thing I have had problems with is the wireless remote unit / or 16s flash trigger . It seems to not fit all the way on my hot-shoe so my camera register that a wireless remote is on it . I found a quick work around to make it work ( I rubbed the metal center pin of the remote unit on top of the hot-shoe rail go to my settings Canon T3i wireless flash and the option becomes available to edit the settings and it registers that a remote unit is there , but if I do n't do this it will not give me that option or it wo n't be available cause there is not connection between the camera , shoe , and the remote ) but if I take it back off and reattach it properly I will have to do it again seem miner but is a problem with working with kids I shoot a lot of kids and you know its hard to get them to sit still let alone repeat a pose they accidentally did . I missed a few great shots the other day due to this but it was not a deal breaker for me . I hope that I have gotten a bad receiver ( meaning to metal base too long ) and can get a replacement that I do n't have to do the work around tactic . I will change my rating to 5 star later if that is the case. < br />< br /> Now the 2 flashes work perfectly I love to have the ability to control the flash output from the camera while moving around my subjects and not having to over and reset them. < br /> I took about 320 shots yesterday with the flashes straight out of the box &# 34 ; NO CHARGING &# 34 ; and they held their own . I probably will get a 3rd flash just so that I can have a extra if one goes down . The flashes work on top of the hot shoe without any problems . They are big and powerful ! The size is due to the Li-Ion Battery . I have a Canon Speed-lite TTL 430 it takes 4 AA batteries which looks like a little cousin beside these .#### #### ####[([111], [113], 'POS'), ([123], [119], 'POS'), ([253], [252], 'POS'), ([50], [48], 'POS')]
I wanted to like this , but similar to other reviews , I had the cork become stuck on the 2nd bottle I opened . It was very difficult to remove . I had a different model for many years and never had the cork become stuck after removing it from the bottle . I am returning this item and ordering the item I had previously . I think there is a design flaw in this model that let 's the cork become stuck for some reason . Either that or it does n't work well with the plastic corks they are putting in wine bottles now .#### #### ####[([15], [7], 'NEG'), ([52], [46], 'NEG')]

I bought these and put one in each produce drawer in my fridge . I also bought some reusable produce bags that are mesh and was hoping to reduce my usage of plastic bags from the produce department . So I thought that the ethylene absorbers would help my produce from wilting in the produce drawers of my fridge while the produce is stored in the mesh bags in there . My celery and lettuce ended up being wilted after one day even though I had the absorbers in there . So , I switched back to storing my produce in plastic to keep the air from making it wilted .#### #### ####[([8], [18], 'NEU'), ([20], [18], 'NEU')]

Note : This item was offered by the company for review . I will provide my honest opinion. < br />< br /> So to just start this out this cup is absolutely a solid item . It has so many uses than just what it says. < br />< br /> Let 's list a few of them :< br /> 1 ) Obviously it can be used to make protein shakes which is great for me because I just started working out again and can use the help. < br /> 2 ) I do n't know if people notice this but it would make a great thermos . It looks like it might be insulted a little bit , but the stainless steel might help. < br /> The bottom screws off which could easily be used as a cup or bowl . ( The described purpose of holding things which is also great ( powder , earphones , etc ).< br /> 3 ) It seems very tough and strong , and I think would definitely handle a good fall on concrete. < br />< br /> I honestly see no negatives on this product as it not only does its original purpose , it has many more uses. < br />< br /> Very recommended item .#### #### ####[([220], [210], 'POS'), ([133], [124], 'POS'), ([120], [119], 'POS'), ([183], [182], 'POS')]

A friend of mine ordered this STX International STX-1000-CE chef 's elite 15 minute vacuum marinator and could n't stop talking about how tender the meat was after using it . I finally decided that since my boys love to grill , it might be worth a try , and since I know from experience with previous dealings with the STX personnel that they are easy to work with if not satisfied , I went ahead and got one . ( I thought to myself that this marinator really could n't make THAT much difference , but I was completely unprepared for what I experienced !)< br />< br /> We first grilled chicken breasts , and I noticed that most of the sauce I used to marinate the chicken had disappeared after 20 minutes of marinating . The vacuum process had actually drawn the sauce into the holes we had poked into the chicken . Hmmm , I thought , but will it really deliver after being grilled . Absolutely ! It was the most tender chicken breast I ever remember eating ! I actually was dumbfounded , and the flavor was amazing !< br />< br /> Next , we tried T-bone steaks . I decided to experiment and marinated half in the STX-1000-CE and did n't marinate the other half at all . Needless to say , it was not at all difficult to tell the difference between the two . The boys actually seemed a little disappointed and even commented that it did n't really seem to them like steak because it was n't tough & chewy . Are you kidding me ?! ? I 'll take steak that eats and tastes like prime rib any day of the week over tough steak !< br />< br /> This product helped me to understand how meat is meant to taste . Thank you !#### #### ####[([129], [120], 'POS')]

Do Not Use with Apples < br />< br /> I used this french fry cutter to chop up about 5 bushels of Apples before grinding them to use in my cider press . While the unit does cut Apples quite well it is not made from 100 % stainless steel . Whatever metal is used in the rivets that make the pivot joints reacts badly with the malic acid in the Apples .

This review was done by a 30 something mother of 7 . Item : 12 Inch Round Premium Non-stick Silicone Baking Mat Item Description : • NON-STICK MAT FOR BETTER BAKING • Professional quality BPA Free • Safe for oven , microwave , dishwasher Product Review : I was really excited to get this item in the mail ( as were the kids because they knew that meant we had to try it out ) . We decided we would bake chocolate chip cookies on it our first go round . I put my round mat on a rectangle pan from Williams Sonoma . I added 3 cookies onto the pan with cooking spray and we baked the rest on the mat . The ones on the pan came out much crispier . The ones on the mat were lighter on the bottom , but crisped once they had cooled a bit . When they first came out there were “ gooey ” in comparison to the ones directly on the pan . I had to let them cool to prevent them falling apart . Overall , the mat was a very easy clean up . It cooked evenly . I would like purchase a larger one for my rectangle pans in the future . I am anxious to use this mat for other baking to see how those items turn out . Pictures are 1 ) before cooking 2 ) after baking 3 ) bottoms of the cookies I purchased this item at a discounted price and was asked to give my unbiased review on the product . This review is 100 % my own and the cost of the product does not reflect my review in any way .

It is microwavable and dishwasher safe , but , I 'd advise to hand wash. < br />< br /> Overall , very nice dish and will look great on your table .#### #### ####[([89], [88], 'POS'), ([57], [67], 'POS'), ([78], [70], 'POS'), ([39], [40], 'POS'), ([2], [1], 'POS')]

The Kay Signature Collection has done it again . Dicing and mincing fresh crisp herbs has never been easier ! The 3 ” 5 blade scissors are sharp , yet safe to handle and slices through herbs with quick ease . Its ergonomic design makes it easy to handle large preparations . The Classic Zester Grater slim design has made this my go-to gadget for the summer . It is great for small jobs like adding lemon zest to desserts , shredded cheese to salads and coconut shavings to smoothies . Gone are the days of pulling out the bulky shredder just to add that special touch to an everyday dish . The durable plastic handle assures its safety when not in use .#### #### ####[([39], [42], 'POS'), ([14], [18], 'POS'), ([63], [72], 'POS')]

These are the second set that we 've ordered for our daughters and by far these have been the best bottles we 've ever owned . I ca n't say much about these new set ( because they just arrived in the mail ) but I can about the other set . We 've had the other ones for nearly five months and they have survived numerous trips to amusement parks , zoos and trails with ZERO leaks . We 've owned dozens of other water bottles for our children but the majority of them tend to warp and leak ... but not these bottles . The only issue that we 've had is when we dropped one on concrete the bottle cracked . The bottles are hard plastic and not the soft type material. < br />< br /> Overall , we 're very happy with these bottles .

I got the Coffee and Wine decorated trays , they are easy to carry with the good sized comfortable handles , plus they add a stylish , decorative and functional touch to serving any food , snacks , or drinks on my patio . They also make clean up easier with fewer trips to the house . They come in two sizes a smaller and a large , making them perfect for any task < br />.< br /> They also add a little ambiance to serving snacks like popcorn and milk to my grandchildren when they are watching a movie in the living room , making the simplest snack a extra special experience at Grandma ’s house. < br />< br /> When you feel the surface of each tray , there is a slight texture that helps to keep glasses and plates in place as you carry them , it is not non slip but much better than the last set I owned which had a very smooth surface making it almost impossible to carry wine glasses to the patio. < br />< br /> 1 . Large measures : L : 17.88 in. x W : 15 in. x H : 2.31 in. < br /> Small measures : L : 16.5 in. x W : 13.38 in. x H : 2.13 in. < br />< br /> 2 . These trays are made with some type of wood ( or particle board ) that is 5 / 16th inch thick. < br />< br /> 3 . The little tray weights 1pound and 9.1 ounces and the large tray weighs 1 pound and 14.4 ounces. < br />< br /> 4 . The handles are easy to grasp and carry. < br />< br /> 5 .

Having been a user of paper filters for ages , i decided to cut down on my carbon footprint and try the reusable cloth filters . Doing a side by side comparison of cloth vs paper , i found the coffee was less acidic tasting when using the cloth . You do have to wash well after each use . I have read some people have put their cloth filters in a container with water in the fridge to keep mold from growing on it , I have been using the same filter daily for 3 months now , after use , I wash it well with warm water , let it air dry and I have not had a mold problem . Every now and then i put it into the dishwasher on the top rack and let it get a &# 34 ; deep cleaning &# 34 ; Would definitely recommend this#### #### ####[([23], [22], 'POS'), ([100], [107], 'POS'), ([17], [22], 'POS'), ([31], [22], 'POS'), ([18], [22], 'POS')]

I had never made madeleines before , and the first batch I tried in this pan came out PERFECTLY . The non-stick surface was truly non-stick -- the madeleines slid right out of the pan with absolutely no trouble ( no loosening of the edges was necessary , and a not a single crumb stuck to the pan ) , and cleaned up very easily . I also like that the metal is thicker than many of the other pans I 've seen . It 's sturdy enough to place directly onto the oven rack for baking , and that along with the dark color of the metal produced perfectly browned madeleines .

I sent back to amazon without even really using this scale because the scale part was way too sensitive . When you even brush against the buttons it would add the weight to the thing being weighed making it impossible to really zero out the weight .

This is a nice casserole dish . I was excited to get this , because my &# 34 ; go to &# 34 ; lasagna pan is a 10 &# 34 ; x 15 &# 34 ; enameled cast iron behemoth that cooks the perfect lasagna . At 20 lbs . it is difficult to carry . This casserole dish is much smaller dish . Although they claim it is a 9 &# 34 ; x 15 &# 34 ; it is really 9 &# 34 ; x 12 &# 34 ; , in a way I feel deceived because if I am looking on looking online for a 15 &# 34 ; baking dish I expect the cooking area to be 15 &# 34 ; in length ( not the total length including handles ).< br />< br /> Beyond that , this dish cooks really well . I am impressed at how evenly the dish heats up . I was expecting hot spots in the corners , but if they existed I did not see them in the food we baked . I decided to bake a batch of brownies . I did not have to adjust the cook time for the brownies the dish heated well and even the corners were moist ( and crunchy ) . If I use this for lasagna it will be for a quick throw together lasagna . For me , it is just to shallow to provide the layers I like. < br />< br /> This is a very nice quality dish and I am excited to be using this .#### #### ####[([40], [44], 'POS'), ([5], [3], 'POS'), ([232], [231], 'POS'), ([167], [163], 'POS')]

I bought these as I watched a video of Rachael Ray making a healthy version of Mac N Cheese with greens and I just had to have them . I love the pop of red color and the convenience of the single serve size these ramekins offer . They arrived on time and are as described . The price was fair at just over $ 16 . The only con is that the instructions that come with these say not to be used under a broiler -- however I threw caution to the wind and gave it a try as the recipe called for a crisping of the top of the Mac N Cheese in the recipe she provided using these exact ramekins . I did not leave them in the Broiler long ( just 2 / 3 minutes ) and It worked fine for me . Obviously I realize if they are to break or crack it would be because I did n't follow the directions but again I put it in quick and it came out fine . I mean who does n't love Mac N Cheese with a crusty topping ... unheard of ! I have only used them once but they worked out great for me . They do not stack great but you can place one inside the other in a tipsy fashion .

Great looking rack . I got it up easily enough and it feels very sturdy . Came with plenty of pot / pan hooks ( 4x fixed direction / 4x swivel large hooks that slide in the sides of the rack , and plenty of thin metal doublehooks to hang off of the lattice ) . Chains that came were long , and I was able to move them up a few links to achieve the height that I wanted to get. < br />< br /> The 5th star is lost , however , because of the manual . It 's written in edited-but-disjointed english and does not offer much instruction other than an order of installation -- I was specifically missing the size drill bit I needed for hanging the hooks ( I ended up eyeballing it and using 5 / 32 &# 34 ; ; seems to be holding fine but still gives a little cause for anxiety ) .#### #### ####[([56], [65], 'POS')]

I was very surprised by the sturdy built quality for the price I paid . I had one before for $ 60 purchased a year ago that is even close in quality to this one . Initially , the price made me think that it could be crappy grinders you could buy at a gas station , but not ! This is a real Bingo for the price !< br /> I was anxious to see how it works and I was blown away by quality – just amazing and looks like it will keep the quality for years to come. < br /> The chromium treated surface made it looks shiny and luxury . It is very well crafted crusher mechanism . The teeth are diamond shaped and perfectly spaced to give you the best even grind . The kief scraper is absolutely perfect for the job. < br /> I like the plastic ring which makes grinding smooth and silent. < br /> This is the best grinder and best tobacco grinder for that price I ever had !< br /> Delivery was as expected in normal fashion for delivery method I choose . Lavaso was pretty prompt to answer a few question I asked before placing the order – highly recommend. < br /> I am very happy with the purchase.

While this does most of these , I was misled because the photos have everyone with their box FLAT .

I initially bought this for my daughters dorm room walk in closet . I do n't know if the ' foot print ' scared her off , or that she was being kind and realized I probably need it more ... ( if she had taken it I would have gotten another because it 's neat ) . Many of my canned goods come from one of those stores where you bag your own groceries and put a a quarter deposit in the cart so you return it to the rack.Hence , I tend to buy the staples like black beans , corn , kidney beans etc , by a flat of 12 in the box . I 'd stack them on them shelf . That only works for awhile . Then I 'm shuffling boxes looking behind cans , ugh . They end up mixed up because the bottom flat should always be full . By the time I get to the bottom layer I do n't remember what I was looking for and distracted by a find of some odd unrelated can I did n't know I had . This has tamed my shelf , and made finding what I need to make 2 nights of chili for 6 less daunting ( 8 various cans ) . ' Onesies' cans I put on the top rack to easily see and grab from the row . If you have arthritis too , and should n't be lifting all those extra cans , this rack is awesome . I put it together in about 2 minutes . It arrived on time , undamaged , and I would n't hesitate to buy another Deco Bros accessory .#### #### ####[([100], [99], 'POS')]

I received this set as a wedding gift from my cousin . She etched my name and some graphics into them to personalize them before gifting them to me . I like The simplicity of the design and the smaller lids lock on fairly well , but the bigger 9x13 lid does n't fit extremely tight so is better for transporting type purposes rather than storing in the fridge or leftovers . The two smaller dishes work well for storage though !< br /> They etched really well and I 'm still able to put them through the dishwasher with no problems .

Okay first a disclaimer ... I bought this for a totally non-baking purpose ... so I will only comment on how I not only intended to use it ... but how I am using it ! I use a fasta pasta in my microwave ... and it always slops slimy water onto the turntable ! I have been unable to find a microwave container will contain its mess ... I have given up and have been putting paper towels under it but that still leaves a mess ... just a different mess ! Enter the Baker 's Goods silicone pad ... now I layer the paper towels on top of it ... place my pasta cooker on top ... when it 's done the nice cool to the touch pad lets me remove the wet nasty towels for disposal ! Weird use I know ... but it was perfect for what I needed ! I 'm sure this would be fine for baking a small batch of cookies ... but my oven does n't get turned on until Thanksgiving ! I might give it a try then ! I received this silicone pad at a deeply discounted price for my honest review ! I only review things that I find a use for and really love ... this is one of them !#### #### ####[([201], [200], 'POS'), ([95], [90], 'POS')]

Great cast-iron pan that will stand the test of time . After using this for a year , it works just as well ( if not better ) than the first day I bought it . If you keep it seasoned ( as any cast-iron pan should be ) , the flavor will only get better with age. < br />< br /> Highly recommended product . 5 starts#### #### ####[([31], [30], 'POS'), ([7], [0], 'POS'), ([2], [0], 'POS'), ([9], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS')]
Yes , this is a bit expensive , but it is definitely worth it . We had been using a cheap aluminum Whirly Popper for a long time , though cooking with aluminum is not the best since some can leech into the food . Switching to the Lindy 's Stainless Steel popper has been a great change . The unit is very sturdy , well constructed and feels solid . Gas stove tip : You do not want to cook your popcorn too fast with high heat . Instead , add 1-2 tablespoons coconut oil , turn gas on medium heat , and add 1 / 2 cup of your favorite popcorn . Swirl the popper a bit to coat the kernels with oil and then let it sit there while it heats up . There is no need to crank the handle while the oil heats up . You will know it has heated up when a few kernels start to pop which may take 3-5 minutes . When the popping starts , begin cranking the handle . Once the popping slows down , remove from the heat and continue to stir . The unit has such a large base that it retains heat very well allowing the remaining kernels to continue to pop for ~ 30 seconds while it is off the heat ! Open the lid when you hear the last few kernels pop to let out the steam . Pour in a bowl and add some Movie Theater Seasoning and enjoy the best popcorn in the world !#### #### ####[([21], [26], 'POS'), ([32], [36], 'POS')]
These spoons are awesome ! Compact , lightweight - not to mention compostable ! Great for sampling and personal use - they fit perfectly in my wallet so I can carry them with me anywhere I go !

The dish is very pretty . There were two drawbacks . I opened the box the dish was in to make sure it was n't broken , because it was a gift . The dish itself was covered with some kind of film .

Once washed , it sparkled. < br /> There was also a fairly large bubble in the glass . So it 's not perfect , but it is very nice .#### #### ####[([109], [105], 'POS'), ([109], [115], 'POS')]

I bought this dehydrator kit because it comes with a jerky gun and a ton of extra screens and 2 screens for fruit leathers . I love beef jerky and always have so I bought this a little more than a year ago . The cool thing is you get a good bit of original flavor jerky seasoning and curing packs with this . You can make jerky right outa the box ... I buy something like london broil or flank steak and slice it thin . . then I marinade in 1 cure pack + 1 seasoning pack a 1 / 2 cup of water. . I also mix in an extra 2 pinches of brown sugar and crushed red pepper. . let marinade overnight then dehydrate on highest setting till its done. .< br />< br /> The snackmaster kit is an excellent value. . In the past year I 've put mine through hell and it still works as it did the day it came in the mail ... one thing I will say is when it heats up the painted markings on top rub off ... it just tells you temperatures ... Its not a big deal because jerky is all the way up. < br />< br /> This is a steal for the price and makes fantastic beef jerky . I highly recommend nesco 's original beef jerky seasoning and a pack of cure for 1 lb. of thin sliced flank steak . its stupid good .#### #### ####[([141], [144], 'POS'), ([130], [129], 'POS'), ([121], [120], 'POS')]

I found this grater perfect for soft cheeses . It grates smoothly and easily and the handle is strong and comfortable to hold . I love that it has a safety shield as well , because it is pretty sharp . I think I 'll get a lot of use out of this grater ! I love using the microplane-style grater compared to a thicker , larger grater with bigger holes . This grater creates fine and delicate strands that look grate and taste great ! It can also be used for whole spices or citrus . It is the perfect size and easy to hold and use . Not too big or too small . It is stainless steel and dishwasher safe as well , which is a plus . Be sure to let it dry completely before putting the cover back on so it does n't rust ! This is a great kitchen tool and I would recommend it for sure !

First things first . I love that the stainless steel loop that these , or removable . I ca n't stand measuring cups to be in the cabinet below , I prefer them to be within arms reach . Especially when I 'm cooking , sometimes I need to get them quickly . So the closer than they are to me the better . So , since I can take them off of the loop they fit into my pull out drawer perfectly. < br />< br /> Since they are stainless steel they are very durable which means I 'm going to have these for a very long time . Also ca n't stand plastic measuring spoons or are they drive me crazy . And when they do start to fade and are ugly , I ca n't stand them . Stainless steel to me is just a cleaner look. < br />< br /> Since I am in my kitchen a lot , my kitchen is really clean . The last thing that I want and there is something that does n't belong would look like it does n't belong there . Hence my love for stainless steel. < br />< br /> This is a great set and I 'd recommend it to anyone who likes the clean look and wants quality made products. < br />< br /> I received this product at a discounted rate .

We 've used this now twice . Frankly there is no excellent honey extractor on the market . They are all rickety and poorly made and poorly designed . This market is RIPE for a well designed , well constructed honey extractor .... . in case anyone wants to jump in and create such an item . Now , having said that , this extractor is sufficient for the job . While it jumps around all over the place while in use , and it skips gears if you go too fast , the handle and other painted pieces came with the paint already smudged and CHIPPED ( wow , what lack of quality control ) , all the nuts and bolts need retightening before every use ... . despite all these drawbacks , it does extract honey .

I have two other foam mats that I paid around $ 60 each for , and they are better than the Bon Home comfort mat , which is very cheap in both price and quality . The bottom foam does n't have a cover , so I expect the foam to get ripped and pitted . The top almost feels like thick cardboard with grasscloth-like striations . I usually wipe my foam mats with a damp cloth , but I probably wo n't do that with this mat because I 'm not sure what it 's made of and water could ruin it. < br />< br /> The foam is not as thick or comfortable as my other mats .

They are made of silicon , they are easy to clean - just run them under warm water and dry off . They are skid resisitant - these little coasters seem to grip any surface you put them on - including glass and wood ... . They are not too thick , and they are the perfect size for all types of mugs and glasses ...

It does keep food COLD though without icepacks , so I 'm sold on the Packits , could stand to be a bit lighter though .#### #### ####[([36], [29], 'POS'), ([68], [67], 'POS'), ([25], [31], 'POS'), ([88], [96], 'POS'), ([22], [29], 'POS')]

I ordered this to grind my coarse Celtic sea salt [[ ASIN : B000SWTKV0 Celtic Sea Salt ® , Light Grey , By The Grain & Salt Society , Coarse Ground , 1 lb ]] . This grinder works as a table grinder but I bought it for kitchen use - like grinding salt for recipes . Dumb idea . To get a tsp of salt I have to grind and grind and grind for what feels like forever . My bad .#### #### ####[([8], [6], 'NEU'), ([9], [6], 'NEU'), ([53], [57], 'NEU')]

Love them , bought 4 more when I saw them in a store now we have 8 . We take a bottle of water ( or two ) to work every day . Instead of buying bottled water , we now filling up our own reusable bottles from our home filtered water . They wash well in the dishwasher , fit perfect in the door of the refrigerator and in both the cars cup holders . I have small hands , they are easy for me to handle . You can slip a finger ( or your pocket book handle ) through the loop around neck of the bottle and still carry with your hands full . It is also easy to use with a long straw if need be .#### #### ####[([37], [44], 'POS')]

I was so excited about using this to finally make my zucchini noodles , and then I actually used it . No problems there really , it worked like I expected it to . Besides the unfortunate waste at the end of the zucchini , it was otherwise okay . And then I washed it . From what I understood , it was supposed to be dishwasher safe , but the plastic shrunk and the metal fell off the first time I washed it . Now , the metal wo n't snap back onto the plastic and it 's completely useless . I ca n't use it at all , and I 'm going to have to see if there 's a way to return it . If not , I 'll just have to buy a new one . I 'm sad because I really did like it , but I would just suggest NOT putting it in the dishwasher .#### #### ####[([43], [48], 'NEG'), ([138], [142], 'NEG'), ([40], [36], 'NEG'), ([75], [67], 'NEG')]

Let me start by saying I am a kitchen gadget junkie - I had been debating whether to purchase this for a few months , but after reading a recipe for zucchini pesto I decided I needed to get this . Ordered it this morning and was happy to see I can get same day shipping . Off to the market to get the ingredients needed and then I anxiously waited for the spiralizer to arrive . When it came , I quickly opened the box to get started on dinner . Driections are useless , but hey it didnt take long to figure it out . Zucchini pasta was delicious .

I got this as a gift , and I 'm very happy with it . The touch screen settings are great ; I had everything up and running in just a few minutes , and this system is the closest thing you can get to an instant cup of coffee . No more measuring coffee grounds or messy filters to deal with -- just pop in a pod , select the size , and brew . It brews fast and clean up is much easier than other coffee makers . Pods are probably more expensive and available in less variety than traditional coffee makers , but I think the ease of use is worth it . Would recommend to anyone .

After I received it I tried plugging it in . The light lights up and the grill heats up , everything look fine .

I love my Keurig but I do have one complaint . I moved from the platinum to the K550 2.0 .

I would have given 5 stars if it cleaned itself . Great Juicer , probably the best on the market. . only drawbacks are the size and weight of the juicer . This is not a machine you are keeping in a cabinet and taking it out once or twice a day , this is a counter fixture ( why I bought this sharp looking model ) , It makes great juice . It is not too hard to clean if you clean it immediately . You have 6 parts to clean , only one takes a little elbow grease that is the mesh basket / blade which needs to be cleaned well with the provided brush , every thing else is a quick sponging rinse .

It was n't even boiling water as I did n't pour it in until a couple minutes after my electric kettle shut off !< br />< br /> Also , the strainer did n't work well for me . It was fine for full leafed green teas and some black teas , but I mostly drink rooibos and the holes were way too big for it .#### #### ####[([31], [30], 'NEG')]

I love Lorann emulsions , but this one is not my favorite . I liked how it smelled , but when I put it in the frosting and cake that I made for my daughter 's birthday party , I was disappointed . I 'm a cake hobbyist , so I make a lot of cakes , and this one was not met with enthusiasm . Most people ( adults and children ) did not finish their cake , and I ended up throwing most of it away . If people like something , they usually tell you , and if they do n't , they just do n't say anything ... and nobody said anything . Maybe having it in the frosting and cake was too overpowering , but I just did n't enjoy the flavor .#### #### ####[([136], [127], 'NEG')]

First off , if you have n't seen the actual America 's Test Kitchen video review on blenders , check out this link : https :// www.youtube.com / watch ? v = QZArusuuQrc < br />< br /> The tests do n't lie : this blender is really really awesome but at a fraction of the price of a Vitamix . The rounded bottom of the blender jar lets fruit and ice &# 34 ; float &# 34 ; and circulate through the blender jar , so that they will blend evenly . I 've never gotten an issue where only the bottom part of the blender would &# 34 ; blend &# 34 ; as everything else just sits up top and you have to mix it up with a big spoon . It just plain works. < br />< br /> The jar itself is also easy to clean . I also like the little timer on the motor that gives you a countdown until it will threaten to overheat. < br />< br /> I 'm drinking a frozen strawberry , banana , and kiwi smoothie right now . It was made with this blender and yes it will blend frozen fruit just fine . I have n't noticed any functional difference between this blender and my friend 's Vitamix .#### #### ####[([144], [148], 'POS'), ([56], [62], 'POS')]

Beautiful , solid feeling and just right for tea . I 've seen a few reviews remarking they are not that accurate , but I 've gotten them pretty close to the seconds .

I was somewhat disappointed by this shaker . There are several nice things about it . It does n't leak . The bottom cup can be used as a drink cup or for storing whatever powder you want to mix in the top later , like a protein drink that would get yucky if you mix too far ahead . The measurement markings are clear and easy to read , and are embossed so will not wear off . The cover for the hole in the lid is quite tight , and I 'd suggest opening and closing it a couple of times to loosen it just a tiny bit before you have liquid in the shaker. < br />< br /> What I do n't like so much is that the steel feels quite thin to me , and of course , transfers the hot / cold of the liquid to your hand because of that . The agitator is just a piece of plastic affixed to the lid , kind of an empty hub with 6 plastic spokes running from the center hub to the sides . I 'll attach photos as soon as I can . I do n't really see how that really works as an agitator . It does mix powders and liquid well , but I do n't see that it does a better job than shakers without that bit of plastic. < br />< br /> The thing that really sets this apart is the compartment that allows you to take an unmixed powder with you , and mix when needed . Other than that , it is pretty standard fare and not something I 'd go out of my way to replace. < br />< br /> I was given this product for review .#### #### ####[([141], [145], 'NEU'), ([113], [108], 'NEU'), ([61], [52], 'NEU')]

I mean ... this kitchen timer works , in that it keeps time , but it is kind of a nuisance . In a nutshell , prepare to have you ear drums blown not only when you set the timer , but when it goes off as well ( unless your ear drums were blown while setting the timer , then when it goes off , you would n't know cause setting the timer ruined your love of hearing ) . I am a college professor and I bought this timer to keep track of time during my lectures . I refuse to use this product in my class because setting the time is accompanied by a sonic boom of beeps that are wicked distracting . This product could be much improved if setting the timer did not create a safety hazard for myself and others .#### #### ####[([112], [117], 'NEU'), ([118], [123], 'NEU'), ([120], [117], 'NEU'), ([127], [117], 'NEU'), ([118], [117], 'NEU')]

This Loose Leaf Tea Infuser is amazing and such high quality ! I love this more than my more expensive Steeped Tea Infuser !< br /> What I love about this one and that sets it apart , is that it has the added rubberized bottom and top ( where the infuser sits ) . This allows me to set the cup down without worrying about putting it down to hard. < br /> With my other cup Infuser , there is no handle , so this is nice so I 'm not burning my hand. < br /> The glass is double walled and thick ! You will not have to worry about pouring hot water and it breaking. < br /> I love using loose leaf over tea bags , and this has become my new favorite mug / Infuser. < br /> I did receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review , however I truly do love this mug and will be purchasing additional ones as gifts !#### #### ####[([10], [9], 'POS'), ([172], [171], 'POS')]

Like &# 34 ; Death and Taxes &# 34 ; , it is inevitable that the &# 34 ; Stick &# 34 ; in your Non-Stick pan , will one day visit . I purchased this pan about two years ago , and still use it when I need the room . It 's well made , and I 've had no problem with &# 34 ; bowing &# 34 ; while using it on a gas stove . At first , I was in love with this pan , as deeply as a teenage boy could be with his first girlfriend . This pan was so slick when new , it seemed to defy the laws of physics . A fresh egg , dropped into a hot , naked pan , seemed to slide around as if the laws of gravity had been repealed . But alas , after only a few months of steady use , those magic properties faded . Food began sticking a bit more after each use , and cleanup got progressively cumbersome . Mind you , it is still a good cooking pan ( when well greased ) , but those halcyon days of &# 34 ; floating food &# 34 ; and effortless clean-up with just a whisper of a touch from a dishcloth , have faded into distant memories . Like your first girlfriend , the initial enchantment will leave you awestruck ; but with time , the sticky sorrows come . Enjoy the brief season of carefree cooking whilst you can , for soon enough you are sure to be visited by either death , taxes , or stick .#### #### ####[([231], [225], 'POS'), ([253], [255], 'POS'), ([253], [246], 'POS'), ([174], [177], 'POS')]

My only complaint is the steamer takes fooorrreverrrr to steam the milk . Wondering if maybe I have a bum unit ?#### #### ####[([25], [24], 'NEU'), ([43], [42], 'NEU'), ([46], [42], 'NEU')]
We are loving our capresso coffee maker ! I was trying to think of a reason not to leave 5 stars but really , it 's a great item . I wanted one with a removable water holder but decided to go with this one as I tried a Kitchenaid and I always had to worry about it leaking water over the counter . As far as it not having a filter , I use filtered water anyway and have never trusted those little filters that come with some makers . This coffee maker makes a nice strong cup of joe that is served at a perfect temp . Not too hot . We 've been using this maker for about 6 months and it 's been nothing short of pleasant ! I would recommend and I 'm glad I chose this one ( and believe me , I did an extensive amount of research !) also , I like the gold tone permanent coffee filter and not having to worry about using the paper filters .#### #### ####[([93], [97], 'POS'), ([127], [130], 'POS'), ([89], [97], 'POS'), ([122], [130], 'POS')]
Nice pan ! Nothing sticks to this thing , as long as you grease and flour it , the bread just pops out . In my experience you have to fill it about 3 / 4 's full of dough , cook for about 30minutes covered and 15 uncovered to get a nice loaf . Cooks such nice square loafs great for sandwiches , without all the extra preservatives in store bought bread .#### #### ####[([70], [67], 'POS'), ([53], [57], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS'), ([3], [0], 'POS')]

I bought this scale so that I could measure out my food for a diet I 'm on and it works perfectly . The numbers are clear and easy to read . Apparently , people have had issues with not knowing how to change from oz to whatever else ( via the switch on the back ) but the company is ON TOP of it - there was a giant paper in the box with clear instructions and a diagram and I also received an email from the company detailing , again , how to find the switch on the back . I felt kind of bad for Deco Brothers , since it does n't seem like it should be a hard thing to figure out , but oh well .

I love my 7-pack set of 3-Compartment Microwavable Food Containers with Lids by HomeNative Limited ! ! These containers have been so beneficial and motivating to not only myself but to my family as well !!< br />< br /> My daughter loves taking her food to school . She has often complained about the food especially on certain days and frequently asks me for money . I hate that . I have to buy food for the house and then pay for lunches at school too ! So when I saw that I could opt in again for these food containers I jumped right on it !!!< br />< br /> These Food Containers have allowed me to pocket more money to spend where it is really needed . They have also given me a better control over what my daughter takes to school . She loves the idea of meal prepping ! We can fix two or three different meals so she can alternate doing the week for her lunches , which is perfect for me !!< br />< br /> My son has jumped on the bandwagon as well . He tells me what he wants and I put it in the refrigerator . I write on some nice labels that I have and place them on the containers so each one knows which container belongs to them . My son has picked up a little weight by doing this also and I have saved a few bucks !!< br />< br /> For me , since my work schedule is so crazy , these trays have given me added sleep ; a better handle on my nutrition , allowed me to save more money , and the big plus is given me more time !< br />< br /> The main compartment is nice in size and can hold a good bit of meat ; we are meat eaters around here . The other two compartments appear to be the same in size to me and they hold a portion-sized amount of chopped fruits and vegetables. < br />< br /> These Three Compartment Containers to me are of good quality , very nice looking , the lids fit great , and our food is safely housed. < br />< br /> They are also easy to store because they are stackable , give added space in the refrigerator , and make the refrigerator look neat , free up your pots , pans , dishes , and other containers that once were used to house your left over meal.re used to house your left over meal .#### #### ####[([212], [211], 'POS'), ([55], [58], 'POS')]

These are very good lids ! They fit on any pot , and they get sucked right down onto the top of the pot / pan to keep all the juices in the pan .

The handle for this pot gets extremely hot , but this little silicone lid protected my hand and let me pick that pan up !#### #### ####[([47], [48], 'POS')]

This might be useful with a hand-held mixer , but not with a Kitchen Aid or any sort of orbital stand mixer . It ’s much too large for the Kitchen Aid , so I cut it down . So far so good . But the mixer head is n’t fixed . It goes around in a three inch circle , so I also had to cut out the red center section . What I have left is a round piece of plastic with a three inch hole in the center . It ’s useful , but I ’d have been better off making a splatter guard out of a flexible cutting board for a small fraction of the cost . .#### #### ####[([119], [115], 'NEG'), ([7], [3], 'NEG'), ([111], [115], 'NEG'), ([70], [69], 'NEG'), ([112], [110], 'NEG')]

Perfect for measuring the many drinkable vitamins and supplements we take in our house .

I have been wanting some of these since I became a Stay-at-home-mama and really started cooking more . On several blogs that I read they always use these for their baking / cooling needs . I was very excited to get these . I 've used them mostly in place of parchment paper . I 'd love to be able to cut out that cost and waste . I already have a rolling mat that someone gave me , but you ca n't heat it up and its giant and hard to clean . These are amazing . They fit nicely on my larger baking sheet . Cleaning it off was such a breeze . Besides being able to use it to roll out things and just put the whole thing on the baking sheet and throw it in the oven , the cleaning is one of my favorite things about it . I foresee these lasting me many years , they seem like they 'll hold up very well over many uses. < br />< br />* I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review .#### #### ####[([134], [129], 'POS'), ([105], [103], 'POS')]

The Good : Fits in small freezer in office ' fridge . The cube you want pushes out without a problem , the others stay put , and your fingers do n't freeze . No taste added to cubes that I could tell , though I washed my trays thoroughly when they arrived . Wo n't freeze stuck to the freezer floor. < br />< br /> The not-so-Good : Difficult to fill all cavities to a safe level , especially without being at a sink . There is no difference in height between cubes and the edge of the tray , so no inclination for the water to fill cavities rather than run over the side . In my office , I ended up using a large syringe to adjust the water level in each cavity , which sounds silly but it worked . The silicon does n't conduct cold very well which is good for your fingers but makes the time to freezing solid take longer , especially as there is no space for cold air to circulate between cubes. < br />< br /> Overall recommended if these do n't sound like major problems for you .#### #### ####[([177], [176], 'POS'), ([133], [140], 'POS'), ([133], [127], 'POS'), ([78], [68], 'POS')]

These are pretty cool . The big downside of reusable straws are that they get so ... gross . They 're just so hard to clean .

I wanted to wait a while before actually posting a review . So after using the product for a few months now , I can honestly say I love this thing . It looks so cool and I love how I can fill it , grab it and just go . I use it for my teas , coffee , juice , water , hot drinks , cold drinks , or whatever else you can think of . It can be a little hard opening the lid sometimes , but that could be because my hands are always slippery . I would definitely buy again if ever .#### #### ####[([10], [19], 'POS')]
I have recently started using my cast iron skillets ( I 've always dreaded the cleaning side of it ) and thought this would be brilliant ! I was using a kitchen towel and leaving it on the handle because I knew I would eventually &# 34 ; forget &# 34 ; and grab the handle . I was worried about the towel possibly catching fire . I was looking at cast iron pots / skillets on amazon and came across this . It 's fantastic ! I leave it on the entire time I am cooking and it does not heat up . I would recommend this to anyone who uses cast iron skillets . It fits on a smaller skillet I have as well as my large one . I am sure I will be ordering another one ( or two ) . This would also make a wonderful gift for any chef in your life !#### #### ####[([31], [25], 'POS'), ([93], [92], 'POS'), ([65], [59], 'POS')]
This is a good bottle opener that reminds me of a pocket knife and it comes with a bottle stopper . It is not super light feeling , has a good weight and seems sturdy so far . I like the bottle stopper that came with the opener too and it also works well . The product comes in a sturdy box with cut out cushioning if you were going to give it as a gift , presents well . The reason for the &# 60 ; 5 stars is due to either manufacturing or packaging . At first , it looked like there was tarnish or discoloration on the metal and it felt a little rough , I decided to try to wash it to see if it was something that would come off , it did . I believe it was glue of some kind that was on the item . I tried to wash it with dish soap and water and just my hands , but I ended up using a non-scratch pad for non - stick cookware to remove it . After I removed it , it looked fine . It functions like it should and after cleaning it up , it looked fine , but a little more attention to quality control would be good . I was given this product to review for my unbiased opinion .#### #### ####[([107], [115], 'POS'), ([175], [174], 'POS')]
Have to assume some of the other filters are finer . Might want to try inverted for this one , as your coffee will drip significantly , even with a fine-ish grind . I like the flavor with metal filter but the brewing process is a little more difficult and less consistent with the drippage .#### #### ####[([36], [30], 'NEU'), ([31], [30], 'NEU'), ([7], [9], 'NEU'), ([42], [48], 'NEU')]
Before I got these awesome sealing clips from Starixx , i would only put rubber bands on my left over chips , frozen veggies , candies , marshmallows , sugar and other stuff , and I tell you I was really having a hard time removing those rubber bands whenever I 'm gonna use them already or sometimes i would just fold the bags two or three times and leave them like that and the food becomes stale after awhile . With these sealing clips , it preserves the freshness of the left overs and seals the moisture inside really good to help keep the food still good to eat even for days . These clips also prevents food from falling out of the bag and get scattered everywhere since the clips really seals the the bags pretty tight . They are very easy to put and remove as well . It 's just like putting a clip on your hair. . ;) They are also quick to clean and dishwasher safe . These clips really makes some of my daily struggle in the kitchen easier . I really love them ! I got these complimentary product for testing and review purposes . All thoughts and opinions are of my own and were not swayed by anyone .#### #### ####[([29], [31], 'POS'), ([8], [4], 'POS'), ([23], [31], 'POS'), ([201], [195], 'POS')]

The Sowden soft brew is a beautiful coffee maker that makes wonderful coffee . It also stops you from having to buy paper filters and does n't break easily like a chemex .

So , here 's what I like about it ... The ergonomic handle is super comfortable and easy to grip . The peeler blade is sharp and peels easily . The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the angle of the peeler . If you like to peel with a downward motion then this peeler is perfect for you but I peel veggies using a horizontal motion and this peeler does n't allow me to do that .#### #### ####[([57], [53], 'NEU')]

Instant Party ! The package arrived . 2 boys , aged 7 and 9 broke it out , set up shop in 10 minutes , and took orders for 8 people . We used the crushed ice from the fridge dispenser . The next day it was set up at the &# 34 ; Tropical Storm Not Hitting Us &# 34 ; gathering for 18 . Worked great and we were thrilled with the results . There was limited &# 34 ; mess &# 34 ; because it was mostly dropped ice from the loading process . On a diet ? Try making syrup from crystal light mix . A great late night snack -- frozen water with or without flavor that makes you feel like you are eating ice cream ! Even if it stopped working tomorrow , it was a worthy purchase . I 'm sure it will be requested at all gatherings in the future .#### #### ####[([112], [111], 'POS'), ([143], [147], 'POS'), ([39], [43], 'POS'), ([143], [142], 'POS'), ([116], [110], 'POS')]
I now own two of these and ironically each has been branded by different companies . ( I paid twice as much for the first unit purchased a few years ago ! ) Both units perform as expected and include everything you need . ( Timer , probe temp and temp alarm . ) Strong magnets on the bottom of the unit allow you to attach it to a ' cool ' metal surface on the side of your grill , smoker , etc . A single AAA battery seems to last forever ! ! The only reason I wo n't rate it five stars is due to the probe . As many others have warned , you CANNOT submerse the entire probe in water . Water will enter the probe where the temperature cable is crimped . Not a big deal , a wet soapy rag does the trick but you CANNOT forget nor should you assume anyone helping you to clean up knows about this issue. < br /> I cannot confirm the following statement but I have a feeling this unit is no longer manufactured because replacement parts ( accessories / replacement probes ) are difficult to find . I purchased a second probe when I bought the first unit a few years ago so I was not deterred by this issue . Besides , for $ 20 ( vs. .+$ 50 for newer models ) how can you go wrong ! I thought about buying a ' spare ' but I have no reason to believe either unit will fail anytime soon .#### #### ####[([76], [86], 'POS')]

Worked just fine until the handle completely detached from the rest of the pitcher as I took it out of the fridge . It crashed to the floor and broke into about 7 pieces . I 'm not able to return it for a refund or a replacement since the cut off date for that was last month . So , beware . It seems sturdy at first but after a couple months it is n't as well-made as once thought . And now I 'm stuck with a $ 65 pitcher that I got to use for about 2 months , and there 's nothing I can do about it . Not cool .#### #### ####[([71], [65], 'NEG'), ([91], [86], 'NEG')]

I own 4 Instant Pot tempered glass lids now and this new design is much improved over the older ones with the plastic nob in the middle . Along with my 3 extra pot inserts , these lids really come in handy not only for keeping courses warm as you go onto the next course , but also for storing leftovers in the fridge in your insert . They are high quality and run beautifully through the dishwasher . If you use an Instant Pot ( I have 2 ) I whole heartedly suggest investing not only in an extra insert , but lids to go with both inserts .

We 've been using Corelle for years as our children have been growing up . While not high quality dinnerware , it is fairly durable , given that it is made with some structural similarities to plywood so does n't break easily ( but if it 's been in the freezer it breaks easily , of course ) .

I 'm hard on kitchen equipment and managed to wreck both my vintage flexible spatulas , one by burning and one by scrubbing it down to rusting metal . Although people like me should n't be entrusted with nice spatulas , I went looking for new ones at Target and found only thick silicone things . How do people even cook with those ? ( Rhetorical question , no , no , please do n't tell me I do n't want to know . ) This is where Amazon excels ; I could look at a good selection of flexible spatulas and read reviews from other users . This one sounded very good for general cooking as well as turning fish . I am completely pleased . It is great for eggs , turning heavier pieces of meat , flexible when that 's what you need , and strong enough for anything I 've tried so far .#### #### ####[([100], [96], 'POS'), ([46], [52], 'POS'), ([97], [96], 'POS')]

The Farberware Purexook Ceramic Nonstick Cookware pan that we received is versatile , generous in its proportions and easy to clean . It 's finishes are flawless . In browning meats , and root vegetables , butter , etc. , the pan is easy to use , and easy to clean . The only way that the pan let me down over my day to day stainless steel surfaced pans that I have used for 30 + years is in deglazing the pan for sauce bases .

That said , what I like most about the Farberware Purecook ceramic surface is that it is more durable that Silverstone and Teflon. < br /> My four star rating indicates that I like the pan , that I liked the results that the pan delivered .

This battery operated kitchen tool provides a way to add a smoked flavor to food that may be impossible to place in an actual smoker either because it is too delicate in texture or intolerant to heat . This gadget sparks the imagination . Salted caramels , mild Havarti cheese , a martini or popcorn are just a few examples of food items that may be enhanced by a touch of smoke. < br />< br /> Unfamiliar with the company , PolyScience Culinary , I did not know what level of quality to expect but was reassured that they are a division of Breville USA , Inc . This company creates mid to high-end small kitchen appliances &# 62 ; I own and regularly use a couple of their products and am pleased with both performance and durability. < br />< br /> Per the included instruction booklet , do not generate smoke for more than 30 seconds at a time . Capture that smoke with the gun alone or use the hose attachment under a domed dish or lid which covers the food or drink and let the item linger in the smoke for two or three minutes , although depending upon the item it may stay a bit longer if desired. < br />< br /> My first test was infusing a bowl of garlic mashed potatoes and then mac and cheese . It worked better to place the device on its stand and use the flexible hose attachment to accurately direct the smoke under the lid . So , thirty seconds of smoke expelled and then the food rested in the cloudy haze for three to four minutes which seemed adequate to impart a good flavor although that will undoubtedly vary based on the food involved. < br />< br /> For a small device , the gun generates a surprising amount of smoke so be sure the area is well ventilated and away from nearby smoke detectors .

I love this stein . Unlike some other stiens sold for about the same price this one has a very solid lid . Many other steins will bend at the handle portion . I have had one that becomes rusty at the pin holding the hinges together .

Received this as a wedding gift on our wedding registry . After the first time in the dishwasher I started noticing rusting but I told myself it was just dirty so I cleaned it off . After 3 weeks I finally convinced myself the product was defective and contacted amazon but it is past their 30 day return policy which sucks because we got this gift about 20 days before the wedding and opened it about 2 weeks after the wedding . We did not even start using them until almost a month after the wedding . Amazon contacted the manufacturer and the manufacturer is supposed to get back to me in 2 days and see how they can fix this issue . * I will update this review as this develops .#### #### ####[([56], [46], 'NEG'), ([38], [46], 'NEG'), ([49], [46], 'NEG'), ([14], [13], 'NEG')]

24 hour review ...< br />< br /> I usually drink one lg cup of coffee / day and I like it strong . I had a small inexpensive blade grinder , but what a pain , small hopper and no consistency . This one holds up to 1 / 2 lb of beans , enough for a week or more at my strength preference . I 've had two cups in two days . First cup a little week , so I increased the quantity of coffee for the second cup . Both times the grinder was set for a drip grind . I noticed that I seemed to be getting more volume of brewed coffee into the pot than I did prior to using this grinder . So perhaps increasing the amount of coffee is n't the solution , but rather decreasing the size of the grind , Next cup , back to original quantity and smaller grind , I 'll send an update after a few more brews. < br />< br /> Pros : Large hopper , dial a grind size and quantity , EASY to use , consistent ( mostly grind ) , quick to grind , grind exactly what you need and no more , grind enough for several days or weeks and store in zip lock. < br />< br /> Cons : a bit more bulky than I would like , but what can I expect , it holds a 1 / 2 lb in the hopper . LOUD , much louder than my blade grinder , but I can deal with it. < br />< br /> More to come .#### #### ####[([35], [37], 'POS'), ([156], [155], 'POS'), ([15], [22], 'POS')]
Got to replace my husband 's old beat up to go cup . It is hard to find them with lids that do n't require you to flip something open to consume . Others may have found that aspect a ' con ' but I feel it 's a ' pro ' . Have not had any issues w spilling , but that might be since he is used to using a cup w / o a closure on the lid hole .

This is a serious piece of cast iron ! I own a round Lodge cast iron comal and in comparison , this one is heavier , larger , with a deeper lip . It is perfect for grilling meat , vegetables , reheating or cooking tortillas , pancakes , French toast -- pretty much anything you can cook on a griddle or grill pan . I have a heavy duty commercial / home range with large burners and this pan is perfect for covering one burner . Once you heat it up , you can turn the heat down and maintain a very hot pan without needing to keep the heat cranked up . A lot of cast iron pans claim to be pre-seasoned , but this one actually acts that way . Once I rinsed the pan in hot , soapy water and dried , I simply gave it a light coating of olive oil and proceeded to make great chicken fajitas in no time at all . I rinsed the pan in hot water for a few moments and used a copper scrubbee thing on it -- voila ! -- clean as a whistle . The description says it is dishwasher safe but that is erroneous ! Do not put this pan in the dishwasher ! By not using soap , you can start to build up a great nonstick finish . Put the pan on a burner for a few moments and touch up with a towel , so there is no risk of rust . You can use metal utensils on this pan without fear ; it 's super rugged . Take it camping , stick it in the oven -- do whatever you want but drop it on your foot ( it 's heavy ) ! The price point is quite a bit higher than the Lodge comal , but as I mentioned earlier , it 's larger and much heavier . A pan like this , cared for properly , will last a lifetime and become a family heirloom . Gorham is a highly respected company and it 's easy to see why . Please note : the surface is somewhat rough , but this is a benefit because it helps create a nonstick surface ; it wo n't effect your cooking at all . I had an All-Clad grill pan but I gave it away because it had a nonstick finish that I thought leached into the meats I cooked at high heat ( smelled and tasted that way ) . I got a Le Creuset grill pan that I like , but I think I will end up reaching for this pan more often , even for grilling meats .#### #### ####[([184], [192], 'POS'), ([302], [298], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([73], [81], 'POS'), ([307], [308], 'POS')]

I have really gotten hooked on loose leaf tea and this cup is excellent . The infuser is a good mesh so that tea fragments do n't wind up in the cup . I like to lid which helps the tea steep correctly . Once steeped , the lid can then be turned upside down on the counter top and it has an indentation so that the infuser can be placed aside and saved for another steeping of the tea . I 'm really happy with this mug and would buy it again .#### #### ####[([11], [19], 'POS'), ([11], [13], 'POS')]
Fine cut-resistant gloves , but way too small . I dutifully measured , and ordered the indicated medium size , which seemed reasonable , as I am a medium-sized man . They fit my wife , who is 5'9 and 125lb ... So mediums are good for a slender woman , not a medium man . She 's keeping them and I am ordering a large , or an extra large. < br />< br />[ Edit - the seller contacted me to say they 've fixed the size chart problem , plus they sent me out a free pair of XL size . Awesome service and one extra star just for that ; I 'll upgrade to five stars when the gloves arrive and fit !]< br />< br /> Okay , the XL 's fit me perfectly , just a bit snug . These are women 's sizes , or something . A big guy with man hands might not be able to fit in the XL 's , but for most guys , that 's what to try first , I 'd think. < br />< br /> These do what they claim , protect you from accidental slices . I sharpen knives and tools , and these are just the thing to prevent nicks or worse when you 're dealing with large razor-sharp blades . Nice for the grater and mandoline . You should still be careful , of course , but these are a lot of protection for the price .#### #### ####[([227], [226], 'POS'), ([147], [155], 'POS')]

I have owned countless numbers of wire cheese slicers sometimes owning more than one at a time . As they wear they do not work as well because the wire stretches and then they break and buying these over and over again hoping for a different outcome is well ... I think you get it . Finally I learned from experience and bought something designed to do better and it does . This will last for a very long time making exactly the slice I want . I use the dial setting for thickness because not every food wants the same thickness and it works . As a final thought I am grateful to live in a country where slicing cheese properly is among the important problems I deal with and there are smart solutions readily available . So buy this one and feel as good as I do .#### #### ####[([117], [125], 'POS')]

Absorbent and durable ! I 've had this for a couple of years now and just realized how well these drying mats hold up .

I 've washed and bleached this a number of times and it still looks pretty much like the day I bought it .

The Presto heat control that comes with the Presto 06003 cooker is made up of 2 halves , held together with a magnet . This is so if someone trips over the cord , the halves will separate and the cooker wo n't be pulled off of the counter . That if fine , but is a feature I did n't need . The first time it became inadvertently separated during my cooking , I did n't notice it until the temperature of my deep frying oil got too cold to cook. < br /> This 06900 Electric Griddle Heat control fits the multi cooker and is made like the Presto heat controls used to be made .

I 've used this board daily for six years as I wished for something else . Used a coupon to buy it and thought it was a good deal then . In a sea of useless and idiotic kitchen gadgets , it is an OK board and I like the size . It 's as large as I could find that would still fit my dishwasher ( Bosch ) . I use very sharp plain edge knifes and a couple scalloped edge knives on it and it has not been a problem at all . However , if you have fine toothed serrated knives that basically saw through your stock ( Ginza style ) , Good luck finding ANY board that wo n't wear & surrender particles . You might want to think about getting a real knife . This kind of material is used in many professional kitchens because longevity , safety and kindness to a blade . Mine has had many temporary stains , but always comes clean with a brush and / or lemon juice or bleach & water solution. < br />< br /> Here 's what I do not like about it : 1 ) It will slide when wet which is not a deal breaker for me , but if that bothers you , put a towel under it . 2 ) The little feet ( nubs ) on underside raise the board just enough so that when you 're chopping the thin board makes a bit of a slapping sound on the counter which I find annoying . Cure - again the towel . 3 ) What I cannot now endure any longer is that in time the black edges have softened and sometimes mar our granite counters . They have now softened to the point that one can carve them with a fingernail and they feel gummy . I will cut them off with a circular saw , keep the board for some work , but will buy also buy a thicker , more stable board#### #### ####[([150], [147], 'NEU')]

I am very displeased with this brewer . It takes nearly 5 minutes to brew my favorite K-cup and it is weak after selecting the strong brew feature . My last brewer was much quicker and the coffee was richer , stronger . Although , my last brewer only lasted three years my present one had to be replaced after just a couple of months . The customer service department was very help and replaced the brew once I tried all their trouble shooting techniques . My present brewer is slow to brew and it sounds like it going to die at any moment . The pump labors to work . Additionally , my neighbor has a Keurig brewer she bought 10 years ago . Are the brewers being made cheaper so they break and need to be replaced ?

I 'll just say that ours has lasted almost a year so far , so no complaints there . It produces good tasting coffee depending on what pod you have . The only downside is that you have to clean it very often . This might sound weird , but I was drinking coffee from this machine and I would get really tense and lose sleep even from one cup . It took a little while to realize it , but it think it was the old water that gets left behind after a brew and then gets injected in to the next brew . It was probably moldy and toxic somehow and making me sick . Well I started aggressively rinsing it between each cup and that problem of losing sleep went away . I run 3 cups of water through before I make a cup of coffee . While might seem like more of a downside to some , but for me I still think it is convenient and I enjoy the coffee it produces .#### #### ####[([103], [110], 'POS'), ([174], [169], 'POS'), ([53], [62], 'POS'), ([27], [21], 'POS'), ([94], [102], 'POS')]

Purchased this to replace my original full size George Foreman ( GRV80B ) . My original one barely fits four 1 / 4lb turkey burgers . This grill was advertised as a 5-burger size , so we ordered the GRP4 &# 34 ; 5-burger grill &# 34 ; to make cleaning easier with the replaceable plates . We opened it up and it was literally half the size of the original George Foreman Grill . Same width , half the depth . It would only fit two standard 1 / 4lb frozen burgers . I 'm returning immediately so I ca n't comment on how it functions .

Works excellent , I have read the other reviews and do not understand why any of them are getting coffee grounds in their cup or why I am dumping water outside the filter . I have had this filter for a month and have not had one problem with it . I fill the filter just below the rim with coffee and get a very good cup of coffee . I do not get grounds in my cup and the only thing I have had to clean up is the filter and the cup the filter sits inside to put in the machine . I love this filter as much as the machine itself .

It 's not often that a $ 60 product far surpasses my expectations . This set is high quality stainless steel right down to the rivets .

I got this cutting board oil because I was originally only going to use the finish , but after watching videos on the internet and reading some advice , I decided to get the oil so I could apply both to my cutting board . It has made a big difference to my cutting board after applying this . The oil especially , has given my cutting board a renewed look . I would definitely recommend getting this and the finish , but if you are hard pressed to only get one of the two , I would probably go for the oil. < br />< br /> I definitely recommend this . Your cutting board will thank you .#### #### ####[([54], [49], 'POS'), ([50], [49], 'POS'), ([53], [49], 'POS'), ([43], [49], 'POS'), ([42], [49], 'POS')]

Simple , no-nonsense stovetop espresso maker . Why pay $$$ more for other brands ? It makes enough for two small coffees ( for me , cafe au last style ) . Bit smaller than I expected for a 6-cup but lightweight , which I like , as I keep thinking it makes the coffee faster . Really does the job .

It is true that this jar is simple and not fancy or stylish . However , it seals tight . I got grain beetles from a Brownie mix I bought . They are horrible little creatures that can eat through plastic bags and get into containers with lids that are not tight . I went to the store and tested several of the thick plastic containers with seals and I could easily get into them when they were sealed . When this jar is sealed , I do n't think anything can get into it . I had some of these that are over 25 years old . They still look nice when clean . The only thing that is a problem is ... after 25 years the seals became hard . I have had trouble finding replacement seals , in my small town .#### #### ####[([121], [130], 'POS'), ([128], [130], 'POS'), ([35], [33], 'POS'), ([41], [34], 'POS'), ([23], [33], 'POS')]

After reading mixed reviews I was a bit skeptical , but decided it was the size , price , quality that I wanted so bought it . I have only had it a couple of weeks , but have used it perhaps 6 or 7 times . I did not have any trouble cleaning the manufacture 's coating off , and creating a nice cooked on coating . I was worried about the coating coming off , and rust appearing so after each use I water soak and use a brush to clean off food bits , and then dry on the stove and add oil after dry and wok is still hot . So far I have had no issues with the handle , or with rust . I did have an issue with my coating coming off when I made sweet / sour stir fry . I assumed it was the acid in the pineapple but I am not positive . After this problem I heated the wok very hot and cooked on an oil glaze again . Seemed to work , still no rust or issues with wok. < br />< br /> Updated after using for a couple of years :< br /> I use it probably 5-6 times a month . This product has never rusted , or come apart in anyway . I still give it 5 stars . It works great . I still heat dry on stove after washing , and cook on an oil coat after each use which maintains a nice patina . Picture below is after two years of use .#### #### ####[([136], [142], 'POS'), ([261], [260], 'POS'), ([145], [144], 'POS'), ([256], [260], 'POS'), ([105], [112], 'POS')]

I am so happy with this pitcher and I love everything about . I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first because of the negative reviews but decided to give it a try since I really needed a pitcher with a filter capable of filtering all the junk in the drinking water and the toxic fluoride , and I am so glad I decided to go ahead and order it anyway . I realize that the filtering of the water is a bit slow but so what ? If it is going to save our lives and prevent us to get bone cancer from the fluoride that has been added to our drinking water without our consent at all and without any kind of warning to us as to what fluoride can cause to everyone after long term drinking of it , why added to our drinking water ? With what kind of a purpose ? I feel that we all have sense enough to take care of our own teeth without adding something to our drinking water that could kill us . I am so extremely upset about that . Unfortunately if you file a complaint it goes on deaf ears so all we can do is warn our family , friends , neighbors , co-workers and everyone we know to get a filter to get rid of that darn fluoride . But anyway , back to the filter , I really like it and the water tastes amazing ! I 've had several pitchers and also the faucet filter kind and the water has n't tasted this good ever ! I have found myself drinking much more water now and giving more to my dog and he also likes it very much since he is drinking more of it , and I am also cooking with it . Some reviewers stated that it is extremely slow and it takes 14 hours to filter a gallon , that is not true , at least not on mine . It takes approximately 3 to 4 hours to filter a gallon . At the beginning when I started filtering it took about 6 hours but now it has been getting faster and it really serves all my water needs . I have plenty of clean , safe drinking water now and am storing it in the fridge on a different pitcher while continuing to filter water on this pitcher which I keep on my counter . I really recommend this pitcher to anyone that wants to be safe and save their lives by drinking pure , safe water . Peace to all !#### #### ####[([165], [172], 'POS'), ([264], [257], 'POS'), ([282], [281], 'POS')]
Really , who does n't love wine ? Then add in that these are unbreakable and I was sold ! ! My kids love to &# 34 ; help &# 34 ; momma . If they are helping with the dishes I do not have to worry about the safety of these glasses . Plus they are SO versatile ! ! I can give the cups to my kids for their juice or milk . I also used them to make pudding cups . We also really like jello parfaits here , so when I told my kids I had see through glasses for them , they got super excited. < br />< br /> A few of the really nice features about this product is that they are dishwasher safe . Who really has time to do all their dishes by hand if they have a dishwasher ? ? Besides being unbreakable silicone , these glasses also do not turn colors from the product used inside of them . Personally I hate when I use something and then it is stained on inside . They also come with an amazing carrying case making travel from one party to the next a breeze !< br />< br /> While I did receive this product at a deep discount , the review above is completely my own .

This are a great little shaker set. < br />< br /> We bought them to match our stainless / black kitchen . We especially like the pouring spouts that aid with cooking / preparing . One word of caution though , if you use the pouring spout with standard pepper it can come rushing out if it clumps a bit inside the shaker .

Ball jars are used for everything from preserving fruits & vegetables to home decor these days . I have a few of the flat , round pint sized ones that I was using to preserve brandied cherries , but now use to store my homemade bath powders . They are versatile and reusable . I purchased two sets sold on this page . The purple pint-sized ones and the green quart sized . To be honest , I liked all of the colors but choose the ones that cost the least amount of money . They arrived quickly and thankfully none were broken or chipped . I mainly use the pint-sized ones for homemade salad dressings and storing golden tumeric paste for my dogs . These seal nice and tight , so that dressings can be given a shake without leaking . The purple color is very pretty and is also a protective color for some types of foods that do not do well exposed to light . The green quart sized ones I am using for chopped , layered salads . These can also be used to store dried foods like chilies or pasta . If you have a hive , these are great to store raw honey in . I think they would look really cool as a pickling jar . These are also a lovely color and wash easily . I am not sure if these quart sized jars are considered wide mouth . The opening is fairly wide and the lids fit my wide mouth pint jars . I have included a picture of the quart sized green jars and a pint-sized purple jar side by side so you can make a comparison and decide which one fits your needs . Many people use the half pint for salad dressings , but I find the pint-size works for me . These jars are also a very pretty way to offer a food gift to a friend .#### #### ####[([220], [217], 'POS')]

Has worked flawlessly for about 8 months now . I use it primarily for slicing tomatoes , onions and meat for sandwhiches . Lunchmeat at the grocery store runs between $ 8 and $ 10 , but with this slicer , I can buy very good turkey breast and ham for less than 1 / 2 of that price and simply cut it up into slices and freeze or use it as needed .

Perfect for rooibos . The mesh is so fine that you do n't get any silt even . The plastic was a concern to me but I have confidence in this product being Made in Germany . The bigger question is to get the medium or large . I own both and the large is the safer option . It does n't happen often , but the medium will fall into a large cup . Again , this really depends on the size of your cups . Even though the large wo n't fit small cups , it will be just fine in a shorter cup , the basket will just rest inside the cup . So really , if you have big cups , get the large . If you have nice small cups , get the medium . I also got them in green , it 's a nice forest kind of green that they do n't make winter jackets out of these days .#### #### ####[([123], [132], 'POS')]
The coffee maker makes excellent coffee and the design that lets you swing out the works to fill with water and coffee grounds without pulling it from under the counter is a great feature but the poor functioning glass carafe ruins the joy . I just ca n't pour water into the unit without a deluge on the counter no mater what position or speed I try and I now take my cup to the sink to pour my coffee to catch the excessive dribble. < br /> I have contacted De Longhi CUSTOMER SERVICE to see if they have a solution and I am waiting for their reply . The problem ( as I see it ) is the carafe has a plastic lip completely around the top and it disrupts the flow from the spout. < br /> In the meantime I have been using the glass carafe from my De Longhi DC76T 12 cup coffee maker which is all glass ( except for the lid and it works well . I purchased the DCF6214T to replace the damaged DC76T and thankfully I had n't discarded the old unit yet. < br /> I would hope De Longhi will see the problem and have a &# 34 ; Recall / Replacement &# 34 ; program for the current Glass Carafe 's .#### #### ####[([79], [83], 'NEG'), ([29], [36], 'NEG')]

If you have a big family , or go to many dinners where you need to bring a dish ( church , pot luck , etc. ) , or if you just like to cook a whole lot at one time , then this is a wonderful option for you.The first thing you 'll say when you see it is &# 34 ; Wow ! This thing is HUGE !&# 34 ; And it is. < br />< br /> But Black and Decker did n't sacrifice a good pot just to make something huge . It does a splendid job of both slow cooking and then keeping the food at the correct temperature for a long time . I kept chili at eating temperature for hours without burning it , letting it get cold or having it evaporate all the sauce so it would be like concrete at the end of dinner . Then I made pot roast , which was perfectly ready at dinner and tasted wonderful . I had a problem with some chicken in sauce that was still rather raw after ten hours , but I equate with Stupid User Error more than anything else. < br />< br /> All in all , it 's very very good . I did n't give it five stars because although I like it a lot , it has n't cured cancer or provided world peace . It 's just a great big pot that maintains it 's temperature for a very , very long time . Hooray !#### #### ####[([109], [99], 'POS'), ([236], [243], 'POS'), ([47], [46], 'POS'), ([40], [46], 'POS')]

My daughter ordered these for her wedding toast . Out of 150 , 6 were stuck together so tightly we could n't pull them apart without breaking them . Of the remaining 144 glasses , 10 % were easy to connect the stems to the bases , while the other 90 % were so loose the bases fell off the stems . Pretty hard to have a drink when you ca n't set it down and looks pretty ridiculous without the base . As a result , we ended up hot gluing every single base to every single stem . Certainly hope the glue holds ! Some of the bases were cracked , so we were forced to tape them to keep them from falling apart . What should have taken 10 minutes to assemble ended up taking an hour .#### #### ####[([51], [49], 'NEG'), ([94], [97], 'NEG')]

There are people that take their coffee making seriously , and others their tea making . This electric kettle is for both . It has several options for water temperatures to give you the perfect boil . You can set up the temperature for delicate white teas all the way 212 deg for hot chocolate . I love tea and the best teas do require a little bit of care , specially Matcha green tea or Shin-Cha green tea . If the water temperature is not right the end result will be a bitter , not so pleasant cup of tea . I brewed my first cup at the suggested temperature for green tea , and let the tea steep for about 3 min , lo and behold it was the best tea I 've had at home that turned out so perfect right off the bat . I no longer have to wait and guess for the water to cool down to achieve the delicate flavor of my delicate teas . The kettle itself looks sleek and elegant , and it is so quiet that you will not believe it 's boiling water ! A soft chime will let you know when your water is ready and it was so cool , because it sounds like the little bell they ring at tea ceremonies . This unit is easy to operate , has a cord that stores under in case you do n't need it too long , has an automatic shut-off feature and a Keep Warm setting . Once you turn it on the On / Off button will flash until the kettle is done so do n't think you need to wait for it to stop flashing for it to do its job . I 'm very very pleased with this electric kettle , I also think it will last a long time because it seems well made and Kenwood is a good brand .

Recently , I attended a cooking class with a local chef who just returned from 13 years of cooking in Italy . She taught us how to make pasta during the class and the pasta turned out to be the best pasta I 've ever tasted ( I love pasta , too !) . In light of this , I decided that it was time to start making my very own pasta. < br />< br /> The very next day I purchased this machine off Amazon since it looks just like the one the chef was using . ( Upon inspection of the machine , I 'm fairly certain it is the same model she was using ).< br />< br /> As soon as this machine came , I had to try it out with the recipe I was taught. < br />< br /> The result : amazing pasta ! I could n't be happier . I do n't have cons for this machine yet . It is perfect . I could n't be happier and am very glad that I did n't go the cheaper route. < br />< br /> If you 're serious about making pasta , buy a serious machine .

I bought because she said &# 34 ; just add water , put the pasta in and cook for the length of time it says on the package. &# 34 ; LIE . You have to cook for the length of time it takes to boil the water + the length of time it takes to cook the pasta . It 's just as easy to bring water to a boil on the stove and cook it there -- takes almost exactly the same amount of time . So beware America 's Test Kitchen , Cook 's Country , etc . reviews -- they are misleading like in this case and the company takes absolutely no responsibility for broadcasting misinformation to public . If you want to pay $ 15 for a plastic box , then this is a great deal .#### #### ####[([99], [96], 'NEG'), ([172], [171], 'NEG')]

A BIG disappointment after two fantastic Bunn 's in twenty years . This High-Altitude brewer ( new design ) does not have insulation around the stainless tank is it is too hot to touch . Being hot all the time heats my cupboards above the brewer. . The water evaporates if not used daily . It is impossible to pour out of the carafe , unless you pour very slow - it drips all over . It is noisy as it heats . Definitely cheapened all around . Due to being on vacation , I cannot return it , or it would be gone .#### #### ####[([42], [36], 'NEG'), ([39], [36], 'NEG')]

I 've only used this once but I love it . This size accommodated about 40 people for tea . It was a hit with the adults at my daughter 's birthday party in a park . I boiled water and let it sit in the dispenser for over an hour , and then filled it with brewed tea . It kept the water hot for 6 hours - which was the duration of the event . It was easy to transport . Some reviewers had concerns about top being tough to push to get the liquid out . I thought it was fine , but I did have to help one of the older folks at the birthday get the water out . Looking forward to getting more use out of it .#### #### ####[([63], [64], 'POS'), ([118], [114], 'POS'), ([121], [114], 'POS')]

I guess during my home economic days , we never learned about a Zester Grater ! I remember using a small hand held grater to grate lemon , lime or orange zest . It was very awkward to use . Now that I 'm taking some time to use the Kitchen Kings Premium < br /> Zester Grater , what a difference it makes ! I really like how this gadget works . I have used it to make lemon zest and to grate cheese to add to a pasta dish. < br />< br /> The zester grater has a protective plastic cover for safe storage . I really like the soft-rubber grip handle . The length of the stainless steel blade is 8 &# 34 ; long , which gives you plenty of space to grate. < br />< br /> I obtained this project in exchange for my honest review . I 'm very satisfied with the zester grater and would think anyone who makes zest , grates cheese or wants to make chocolate shavings would be very happy with this gadget .#### #### ####[([4], [5], 'POS'), ([176], [181], 'POS'), ([26], [20], 'POS'), ([30], [20], 'POS'), ([106], [101], 'POS')]
Was hoping it would fit the larger round , Asian style , ramen packs perfectly . It was bigger than it needed to be and the round packs fit very small in it ( so it takes more water to cook the ramen ).< br /> The quality was very good and could be used for other things , beside ramen . The large square Asian style ramen packs fit in this , with a push down to fit , to make them fit in a round bowl. < br /> Since this is specifically for ramen , I was hoping the larger round ramen packs would fit perfectly ( like the Rapid Ramen Cooker does for small square ramen ) , since it does n't , have to put more water to get the height need to cook the ramen . If the bowl was maybe an inch or so , smaller in diameter , that it would be perfect .#### #### ####[([131], [130], 'NEU'), ([38], [37], 'NEU'), ([26], [30], 'NEU')]

PROS < br />- cute < br />- good variety . The rings I purchased arrived with a perfect assortment of rings displayed , Sven , Olaf , Anna , Elsa , Kristoff and Frozen < br />- stickers on the ring where placed with care . I used these rings on plastic baggies , not on cupcakes , so , if the sticker were not placed exactly perpendicular to the ring , the ring would look crooked . Not the case , every single ring was perfectly aligned. < br />- arrived on time < br />< br /> CONS < br />- Price . These are way overpriced on Amazon . I found them for more than 50 % less at Target . I really wish I looked there before purchasing from Amazon . I usually only take a star off for price when it is grossly overpriced and easily found elsewhere. < br />< br /> TO BE NOTED :< br />- size was a bit large for my 2 yr old daugther , and slightly large for my 4 yr old son who has chubby fingers and is in the 85 % for height and weight < br />- some of the other reviewers called these &# 34 ; cheap. &# 34 ; I found the quality of the plastic perfect for what they are ... cupcake rings . These are cupcake rings that are intended for small children to play with for a short period of time after the cupcake is served . They were designed to adorn cupcakes , not children . I found the quality to be just fine. < br />- my daughter LOVED seeing all the different characters on the rings. < br />< br /> I would buy this product again .#### #### ####[([185], [184], 'POS')]

UPDATE : This stone ware cooker has been redesigned to have sharp edge interior bottom which is less efficient than my original Stone Ware Cooker with rounded interior bottom . The new has more volume however has added 10 to 20 seconds for cook time . I use the Stone ware cooker with my Mini food processor ; Recipe : In Food Processor ( Proctor Silex 72507 Food Chopper ) add 2 eggs , 1 Tbl Milk ( reg or Condensed ) , 2 finger length pre-cooked frozen sausage ( Banquet Brown-N-serve ) and a pinch of pepper . ( No Salt it stiffens the eggs ) . Process for 5 to 10 seconds . ( Note in Mini Food processors the initial startup may force some liquid to seep out from under the lid . ( Cheap Construction but it works ) In Stoneware a quick shot of Pam then with a paper towel gently spread out the Pam . Pour in egg concoction , replace Lid and Microwave for 2 min . in 1000w MW . Watch as after about 1 min the beginnings of a Souffle lift the lid of the Stoneware . Alas as soon as the time is up the Souffle falls in on itself . :( However the result is close to a Sausage / Egg souffle ) . Add Salt sparingly if that 's your taste . Eggs slip smoothly out of Ceramic pot onto plate then flip over to view your sausage topped fluffy egg breakfast .#### #### ####[([149], [146], 'NEU'), ([14], [11], 'NEU'), ([5], [11], 'NEU'), ([34], [33], 'NEU'), ([43], [33], 'NEU')]

This is a great addition to your kitchen . Use to make salsa or other chapped foods that you do n't want to chop as fine as in a blender / food processer .

After weeks of use this press seems to be as perfect as it gets and for about $ 20 it would n't have to last very long anyway but it looks like it may last a long time. . I was scared off a stainless press because of the reported toxic &# 34 ; dust &# 34 ; created from wear on the plunger screen so I wanted a glass model . Since I am a little clumsey in the morning , I am concerned about handling this glass full of near boiling water and potential glass shards all over the kitchen so I try to be deliberate and careful and hope for the best .

Great grinder . I was a little hesitant to buy a blade grinder after the coffee connoisseurs always mention buying a burr grinder , but I have no qualms at all with this . After maybe 8 months of daily use , it still functions like new . I can grind at any coarseness by just grinding longer for finer. . I use it usually with my french press though. < br />< br /> The only negative I can see with it is it is a little weird to put the cup of coffee beans into the grinder . Maybe it is me , but it seems it does n't fit right until I find the precise orientation . This is so minor though . You really should buy this grinder if you just want to start grinding your own beans. .#### #### ####[([68], [77], 'POS'), ([12], [6], 'POS'), ([92], [88], 'POS')]

Updated : I ’ve had this grinder for a year now . All in all a good grinder , but big and clunky . The top grinding piece seals magnetically to the grinder , and on a rare occasion will fall off .

I was very happy with this product . The coffee was amazing , it was easy to use . It seems to be built very well . One thing I noticed is that the seal around the filter was perfect .

I also think it ’s attractive enough to sit on the counter and it ’s dishwasher safe , which is always a plus .

Great product ! Keeps my coffee much hotter , longer , than the Starbucks travel mugs I have used in the past . I have always been annoyed by flip lids so the push button is a big improvement . The ability to pull out the mechanism for cleaning ( levers out on a spring does not totally separate from the lid ) makes me feel like it cleans better . I alternate hand washing and top rack dishwasher with these .#### #### ####[([73], [76], 'POS'), ([29], [37], 'POS')]
I 'm not an athlete , but I am an avid water drinker ! I carry a water bottle with me everywhere I go and I love my water bottles . I also always want more . When I first took this bottle out of the box , I immediately loved it . It was so light and soft to the touch and I knew we would be besties ! There 's also a cute little strap that I can carry it from that lets it swing easily and is a nice alternative to the hard plastic handles and loops on some of my other bottles . It 's just so convenient to carry that way . I received it today and immediately took it out on a family outing to test it out . I love that it has a latch to make sure that it does n't pop open if you have to throw it in a bag , which we did multiple times with no leaks ! My almost three-year-old son also loved it and insisted on carrying it in his backpack , which made its weight nice . He also loved drinking from it and was able to open and close it himself . Like some of my other bottles , I prefer to drink from it when held sideways . The only problem that this posed was when I got to the last little bit of water and some came out the air vent . I 'll just have to remember to drink it straight on when I 'm down that low . As for size , I really prefer a larger capacity bottle . Since I drink filtered water , I prefer to take a day 's worth of water with me to work and have a glass bottle and an insulated stainless steel bottle that I use for that purpose . This wo n't replace one of those , but it will be nice for quick trips out or when I need to travel light , but still want my water . Overall , I love it and look forward to the adventures we 'll share together !#### #### ####[([68], [74], 'POS'), ([68], [58], 'POS'), ([310], [308], 'POS'), ([17], [10], 'POS'), ([4], [10], 'POS')]

These seemed to work fine for a couple years , until I baked something in them that stuck . I soaked them in hot water with a little dish detergent , then washed and rinsed as usual by hand .

I buy dozens of can openers a year and it is amazing to me at how brand-name brand-new CanOpener 's will break on the initial use . The handles will strip or something goes wrong . However these are an exception . It cuts the side not the top like tradditional CanOpener so there 's no sharp edges and it 's very easy and seamless . The top comes off almost like it 's invisible . In other words you do n't even know you 've cut it do you go to pull the top off .

Decent toaster . I do n't think any company makes a &# 34 ; good &# 34 ; toaster these days . I use it for English muffins , and if they are on the small side , I ca n't get them out of the toaster .

My husband loves this product and now uses it for EVERYTHING . I like it , but I wish it did n't rotate so much ... So I docked a star . It needs some kind of lock button on there or something .

I hate seeing a dish rack on the kitchen counter and have been looking everywhere for the over the sink kind like this one , even at Bed , Bath & Beyond they did n't have it . So I was so happy to find it here on Amazon . It fits my sink perfectly , and I really love that you can extend the one side to fit your sink better . About the only thing I do n't like is that after a few months , the plastic silverware holder broke off . Luckily I had another one on hand from my other dish rack holder I keep under the sink for when I have a party and need an extra dish rack . It snapped on to this one perfectly .#### #### ####[([90], [85], 'POS'), ([48], [42], 'POS'), ([86], [85], 'POS'), ([76], [85], 'POS'), ([106], [104], 'POS')]

When I first opened the package I was a bit disappointed by the small size of this grinder , furthermore after a few uses the knob attached to the top seemed a bit rickety. < br />< br /> The above being said , I thoroughly enjoy this little grinder and use it almost every day . It looks great and is very sturdy , you can precisely choose what size of grind you want and can have home ground coffee at your fingertips for a very low and reasonable price . If your brewing coffee for 1-4 people this is an ideal size . Great customer service from the company as well .#### #### ####[([14], [10], 'POS'), ([17], [10], 'POS')]

I love this digital thermometer .

purchased in 2010 and thing is great . I used about once per month or so and we love it . It does a great job even with some hard cheeses .

I bought this because it said the capacity wound brew 12 cups . If you like yellow coffee , it might . But the metal bowl holds only 3 tablespoons of coffee beans . My CBC approved coffee measuring spoon holds 4 teaspoons . I use one measuring spoon for two 5 ounce cups of coffee . That is half of what the coffee experts recommend . What I get is restaurant strength coffee . Now the math . A restaurant style cup holds 8 liquid ounces . Today 's automatic coffe makers use 5 ounces as a cup . They used to use 6 ounces when they told us the pot capacity . But , I suppose one manufacturer advertised greater capacity in cups using the smaller definition so they all followed the leader to remain falsely competitive. < br /> To make a full pot ( 50 ) oz . ( 10-5 oz cups ) It would take a little more than 2 grinds unless the cup is overfilled . Like other blade grinders when over filled , you could get powder on the bottom and large chunks at the top. < br /> I grind enough beans for about a week of full auto pots . The ground coffee goes into a sealed container . I can detect a taste difference between the first pot I make and the last . If I did , I wound store the sealed container in the fridge , which is where coffee should be kept ground or whole. < br /> So this little chopper , is restricted to grinding spices and I will buy some other grinder for coffee . So far it ground cumin seeds and mustard seeds and did a good job at that . But do n't call it a coffee grinder unless you do n't like coffee which I have been drinking black for 48 years .#### #### ####[([134], [127], 'NEU'), ([183], [188], 'NEU'), ([146], [145], 'NEU')]

love this . i go through periods where i just crave salads . i bring it for lunch at work , but hate when things get soggy by the time lunch rolls around. or equally hate packing salad fixins in numerous containers or small ziploc bags . this collapsible container fixes that ! i really like that the top portion layers into the main , that it expands when it 's time to put everything together & collapses when done . the salad dressing container is adorably handy. < br />< br /> wo n't have an immediate need to use the freeze tray feature , as my commute is not long & goes directly in the fridge when i get to work . but i can tell that it 'd be a great feature for when needed ... no fridge access , long commutes , etc. < br />< br /> extremely mutli purpose . definitely not just for salads .#### #### ####[([24], [26], 'POS'), ([134], [133], 'POS'), ([134], [143], 'POS')]

It 's a good basic toaster which comes with a crumb tray at the bottom part which is a nice bonus beside the unit being cool to the touch on the sides but I was kinda hoping it be cool on top too because whenever I 'm using the toaster I sometimes forget that top art is not cool when I make toast with regular sliced bread and for it burns my fingers which is a pain especially if you 're like me being forgetful sometimes but not that often that I would forget though regardless this is still a good operating toaster.It still works great even today and for that I am happy since I bought it for the house and for my aunt as well I particularly got the red one since she really favors kitchen supplies in red and maybe in black too.I still have yet to use this toaster for bagels like one of my favorites the everything bagel which I look forward to buying again from the Stewart 's Shop close to where I am but when I do use this toaster for these bagels I will really enjoy them even more and this is a great red toaster for the Kitchen plus my aunt likes it a lot not only that It made her happy too .#### #### ####[([62], [58], 'POS'), ([15], [25], 'POS')]

Calling all cooks and grill masters ! ! This instant read thermometer is amazing . I am what people call a very paranoid cook . I am constantly worried that food will not be fully cooked , or cooked to the liking of guests . This thermometer is absolutely great !

I am always worried that one was not accurate. < br /> I find that this instant read thermometer is great and I used it the very first day that we got it .

I got mine at another seller , but used the info here to make my decision . No one scored perfect , but this is close . Been doing daily breakfast on it , scrambled eggs , hash browns , in addition to waffles Gotta really try to get anything to burn , but cooks reasonably fast , eggs are done fast . only an extra large egg at a time , but turn over is pronto if you desire 2 or 3 . I use the Egg Beaters product , and fill the griddle till full , then just flip them out as they get done . Hash takes longer , but easy , no muss , no fuss , make them first , eggs second , and breakfast is served in under 6 minutes . If you substitute tater tots , they need to be thawed first , but can be done .#### #### ####[([15], [20], 'POS'), ([67], [65], 'POS'), ([70], [66], 'POS'), ([18], [20], 'POS')]

The dehydrator works great ! The digital timer is really helpful so I do n't have to keep checking on the food that I have drying .

PRO : It is the best manual juicer . Long handle makes juicing easier . Does n't rust . Quality parts . Metal clamp so it does n't move . CONS : Made for greens . Must cut veggies in small pieces and for best results , feed a hard veggie after a soft one [ like a carrot or celery after spinach or wheat-grass ] I bought it to make green juice and fruit sorbet . It was n't made to do fast heavy juicing . I like the new black color . Matches better with the kitchen . It 's important to remember to keep the juice cup under the handle and after cleaning and reassembly , that all parts are tight .

I was looking for a means of straining the guava pulp when making jelly , which we send to friends and family at Christmas . Our one guava tree will produce 140-160 jars of jelly , so efficiency is important to me . I saw this bag and thought it would do the trick better than plain cheesecloth and have been delighted with it . It lets all the juice through , but none of the pulp or seeds . It is also strong enough to be able to squeeze the pulp to get all the juice out . Our straining per batch has gone down from 4 strains to 2 and the second strain is actually unnecessary . It gets it all the first time . I love this bag and will probably order another one to have on hand . It does the job perfectly , is easy to clean and makes the entire process easier . One thing I would like to see is a larger width , maybe 14-15 inches to fit around the top of the pan . Overall , a magnificent straining bag .#### #### ####[([160], [157], 'POS'), ([125], [117], 'POS'), ([78], [83], 'POS'), ([156], [149], 'POS'), ([114], [113], 'POS')]
Arrived in new condition & original packaging . Holds max 1.7 liters at fill line . Filled with cold water , boils in 6 minutes . The light only stays on while the heating element is on - once the water starts boiling , the element & the light both turn off . I only gave 4 stars because it is not double wall insulated therefore , the outside of the metal karaff is extremely hot & cannot be touched & must be kept at a distance from everything . However , the handle stays cool allowing use immediately . In short , I love it & I 've completely done away with my old stove-top kettle because this is more efficient & safer for my elderly parent who cannot accidentally leave this on ( unlike the stove ) .#### #### ####[([57], [62], 'POS'), ([11], [18], 'POS'), ([14], [18], 'POS'), ([116], [123], 'POS'), ([93], [101], 'POS')]

One little bit of advice .... remove the paper ! When I first got this I was super disappointed that it was n't black , it was kinda brownish and it looked unfinished .

I purchased Go Green Lunch Boxes for my children thinking we would help the environment and save money not having to use ziplock bags . Within one week the water bottles leaked . Within a month the clips that hold the lid to the main unit all broke . Shortly after that the compartments leaked each time underneath the plastic covering of the outer case and the lunchboxes looked and smelled terrible with food stains . I had to ditch the Go Green water bottles and use small plastic water bottles to fit in the drink compartments and put food in ziplock bags before putting them into the food compartments ! In less than 2 months , the zippers broke off of the outer cases . When I called Go Green they said they were aware of the issues . They asked me to ship back the defective products ( at my cost ) and said I could re-purchase 3 new ones ( at full cost ) but with free shipping ! This product was a complete waste of money .

Filter design does n't work . I have a Kuerig K-cup brewer . This filter does n't brew a full cup of coffee . The reason is because of the size and position of the screen inside the filter .

This is a really great sized grill for large groups . It can be used both indoors or out , but given that it is electric , I do n't think it would be safe to leave outside while not in use . Things to be aware of : the grill surface does tilt down to a drip pan , but this does not have a top plate like traditional Foreman grills , so you will have to flip your items over . ( And the grill time will be longer . ) The plates do not detach , so they cannot go through the dishwasher . This can be used on the base for outdoors , or without it for countertop use . All in all , versatile and great for large group grilling . A bit much for small apartments .#### #### ####[([67], [66], 'POS'), ([134], [138], 'POS'), ([50], [46], 'POS')]

If I had read the description before clicking I would not have bought it. < br />< br /> Having mistakenly bought the plastic press we are now unimpressed with it . The press looks and feels cheap and the flimsy rubber seal allows grounds to slide by getting into the coffee . I do n't expect it to break as others have mentioned , breakage is probably caused by a heavy hand on the press. < br />< br /> But , a coffee cup full of grounds is n't very pleasant in the morning .#### #### ####[([19], [18], 'NEG'), ([139], [141], 'NEG'), ([130], [126], 'NEG')]

This is the second 4 stage RO I purchased on internet . The first one purchased two years ago from a different seller . That one takes about half an hour to get one gallon filtered water . That is about 50 GPD . This one takes a little over 1 hour to fill one gallon , less than 24 GPD , far from the described 50 GPD . updated 11 / 15 / 2015 After taking it apart , the RO film inside is a 50 GPD one with a reputable brand name . Culprit for slow output is in the first GAC filter .

This Aroma stainless steel rice cooker has replaced the crock pot as my favorite appliance in the kitchen ! The stainless steel bowl has a heavy-duty feel to it . It actually pays to go with the stainless steel because besides the health benefits of NOT cooking with aluminum or Teflon , the stainless steel bowl lasts a lot longer also . Our Aroma rice cooker is not limited to just rice . We cook all types of grains as well , such as millet and quinoa . Get the steamer accessory as well to turn this appliance into a one meal wonder . I use it to steam frozen chicken breasts and frozen vegetables from the freezer above my rice or grain in the bottom pot. < br /> The steel bowl may develop a cloudy white film over time . I use just enough white vinegar during cleaning to cover the bottom of the bowl . in five minutes or less the bowl wipes clean . You wo n't have to do this often . Our rice cooker gets used with almost every meal , and we 've owned it for over 5 years now . It 's beginning to show wear . We 're very satisfied with this product .#### #### ####[([211], [208], 'POS'), ([54], [53], 'POS')]

Ca n't find much wrong with this purchase at all . Delivered with Prime on time as promised . Pricing was very good and was MFI certified and much cheaper than Apple lightning cable prices .

I LOVE THIS ! ! I was n't sure if this would work for our goldfish tank , but since we got our fancies at the beginning of spring , I 've had a heck of a time keeping an eye on their temperature since they like it cold . This has been awesome . Yes , there were times early in the summer when I got up in the middle of the night because I heard the alarm beeping , but it was worth it to make sure our fishy friends stayed happy and cold enough. < br />< br /> The only things I wish for this are :< br /> 1 .

This works very well with our new Keurig 2.0 machine .

This bag is the best for a smooth and creamy almond milk . I have found that the almond pulp actually yields more milk than if strained with any other bag , which usually produces less milk with heavier residues that fall to the bottom . This is a drag because you have to shake well the milk before pouring , and drink it rather fast ; plus , the feeling of swallowing the eventual mini fibers is not pleasant . My only complaint is that I find it a tad small , which calls for a more careful pouring and straining , but I can deal with that . If it comes in a larger size , I 'll buy a dozen !#### #### ####[([90], [98], 'POS'), ([10], [9], 'POS'), ([36], [38], 'POS'), ([90], [91], 'POS'), ([1], [4], 'POS')]

These are my first bamboo cutting boards I have ever owned . I worked as a professional cook for many years and the cutting boards is the second most common tool used by professionals ( the first of course , being the knife ) . If you have fine knives you need an exceptional cutting board to maintain the sharpness and quality of the blade . These cutting boards exceed the standards . I especially like that you get 3 matching cutting boards so that you can keep your produce and meat cutting on completely separate surfaces. < br />< br /> Bamboo is a renewable resource . I like that this product is n't a huge chunk of plastic or that a forest had to be mowed down to make this . Some bamboo species grow up to a foot per DAY and it makes one of the most environmentally responsible materials to build things out of . I found a coupon code for this product on the internet that got me a small discount on the price and they requested ( but not required ) that I would leave a review whether it was good or bad . I would buy this product again even without the discount because I was searching for this new cutting boards anyways .#### #### ####[([123], [116], 'POS')]

In only 15 seconds it makes luke warm coffee . I heated the cream and the cup but that only results in slightly warmer luke warm coffee .

Fits all the accessories that came with my food processor perfectly . Has one additional disc slot , but wish it could hold maybe 1 more extra disc and maybe another blade .

This GL210 CP glass replacement carafe does exactly what it claims . It does replace our discontinued Krups Coffee Maker model 865 and operates as it should ! The stop and serve feature of our old Krups unit works exactly as it should with the Medelco replacement carafe - The replacement Medelco carafe fits perfectly under the drip unit and can be removed during brewing and replaced back under the the filter for continued brewing . We took the advice of one reviewer to be sure to order the GL210CP NOT GL210 , as the CP addendum was the one that works for our discontinued Krups # 865 . It does work-accurate advice . The new Medelco Carafe pours better than the old Krups model . The Krups model spilled often while pouring without very careful regulation of pouring tilt and speed . The Medelco is n't perfect but is significantly better . Happy to have found this replacement for our Krups 30 year + unit that still works well !#### #### ####[([139], [135], 'POS'), ([45], [35], 'POS'), ([117], [122], 'POS'), ([144], [135], 'POS')]

More than half of them have fallen apart in the first week of use . They are very thin plastic and the lids crack easily with typical use . I ca n't imagine how they would hold up to microwaving or freezing as some of them melted on the top rack of the dishwasher .

Our filter got totally clogged and I found a way to clean it . Get Dishwasher detergent powder not liquid and add to boiling water . Submerse the filter in it and continue to boil , the water will turn brown . I boiled for about 5 minutes but it has taken 4 times to clean it . At first the filter was opaque when held to the sun but then clear spots appear and finally it is all clear . It really works again . I really like the taste of coffee from this filter so it is nice to have it back again . I will try and clean monthly .#### #### ####[([72], [71], 'POS'), ([90], [99], 'POS')]
Firstly , let me just say that I have no idea how this functions as a baking mold . I bought it to create a roach-proof feeding bowl for a cat who likes to nap in the garage .

This is a very good thermometer and the built in temp chart is very handy . It is certainly accurate enough for the intended purpose and built well for the price .

Perfect for when you only want one cup . The double walled glass cup stays cool in your hand so no fears of burning or dropping from too much heat being transferred . The set comes with the cup , an infuser and a lid . I will note , it 's packaged beautifully for gift giving and very well protected . I feel it 's the perfect size to fit in my hands and it 's cute . I actually used it for my morning cappuccino , the glass makes the layers look nice and would make a nice presentation .

So , I bought this because I just recently invested in an extremely (+$ 2,000 ) set of really good knives . Why not ? I deserve it ! lol So , There is one knife that I have had since I was young and poor – not a very &# 34 ; good &# 34 ; knife by any means – but I just LOVE the weight of the knife . I thought that I would buy this and see if I would be able to make this 20-year-old , crappy knife as sharp ( notice I did n't say &# 34 ; as good &# 34 ;) as my expensive knife set . Well , I have to tell you , It took about 30 minutes , but this knife is now sharper than the super expensive knives I just bought . I ca n't say enough good things about this product . I had / have used rotary knife sharpeners before , my dad had a fascination with sharpening knives , so the technique to use this tool was exactly what I was expecting . If you have never used an automatic rotary knife sharpener before , then you are probably going to want to try this out on a bunch of knives you care less about , if you are planning on using this tool on a very good set of knives. < br />< br /> I ca n't recommend this unit highly enough . Now , my all-time favorite knife is just as sharp as the super expensive set I just bought . I feel good about using this knife , now , for cleaving meats etc . I do n't think you can go wrong for the price of this unit . I am hoping that this tool will last me for at least 5 or 6 years .#### #### ####[([127], [134], 'POS')]

Very disappointed ... I 've used a Krups 963 for years , made coffee and frothed milk with no problems . It finally wore out and had to be replaced . This unit produced extremely hot coffee , and only a small amount of frothed milk . The control knob from coffee to off to frothing was hard to operate . The steaming nozzle is poorly designed , too close to the body of the coffee maker to allow for proper frothing . I did n't have the problem some had with the lid leaking steam . Used it four times , no improvement in the coffee produced . It is being returned. < br /> An additional comment - over the years of buying from Amazon I 've returned a few items , and Amazon has always provided a paid return label . This time the return label is costing me $ 9 ... .#### #### ####[([132], [131], 'NEG'), ([32], [41], 'NEG'), ([72], [80], 'NEG')]
I liked this . I really liked it . I bought my peppercorns in bulk and put them into this grinder and it was amazing . Ground my pepper to my liking ! I like bigger chunks , which you can control via a little knob on the bottom . There 's also a light ! So cool ! You can actually see where you are putting your pepper . What a great feature !< br />< br /> Now , here 's my gripe . I 've been using it for like two months , and suddenly it stopped working . So I 'm like , batteries ! It needs new ones ! So I take the top off , where the batteries are stored and bam ! Hit the button and it starts grinding ! Wow ! It does n't need new batteries ! So I put it back together and nothing . What ? Take the top off again , it works . Put it on , does n't work. < br />< br /> Now , I do n't know what it is . I 'm hoping just a glitch with mine . It really is a cool grinder with good features and easy to use . But I guess it did n't like grinding pepper for me . I 'm back to my hand grinder , and I miss this electronic one working properly . I get really sad when I look at the electric one , sitting there . I know it 's capable of grinding to perfection , but mine glitched , and now I need to strip it down if I want to use it . First world problems over here .#### #### ####[([107], [111], 'NEU'), ([36], [44], 'NEU'), ([73], [72], 'NEU'), ([48], [44], 'NEU')]

BakeitFun Silicone Baking Mat with Measurements , Heat Resistant , Reusable , Non-Stick , Half Sheet 16-1 / 2 x 11-Inch , Raspberry Red + Digital Cookbook < br />< br /> I currently line my half-sheet with a Silpat mat . I was interested in trying this BakeitFun mat to compare it . The first thing I noticed is the cookie grid versus no real markings other than the name Silpat and that it ’s made in France . So , BakeitFun , I do not know and I cannot find where this product is made . I will assume China until officially told otherwise . I looked at the website and of course the packaging . This is the first cooking product that keeps its manufacturing location a secret . Why ? This disturbs me enough to dock one star . I followed the directions and washed and oiled the mat before using it. < br />< br /> This would be a five star product if I did n’t have to wonder where it was made . It performed extremely well in my Nestle cookie test . I ’m not a great baker but I know how to bake frozen cookie dough into cookies . I set my dough clumps in the designated circles and placed them in my preheated oven . I ’m uploading some pictures of my session . I have to bake them a few minutes longer then the instructions as my oven is showing its age . It still works and mostly I adjust to it . They came out golden perfection and slipped right off the mat and onto my cooling rack . After a good rest I ate a couple and they were as good as I could expect . Slightly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside . Excellent result using this mat . I am very happy with the mat and will raise to five stars if a company rep replies to this post with the country of manufacture and answers why it ’s nowhere to be found. < br />< br /> UPDATE : 8 / 31 / 15 < br /> Thanks to the BakeitFun Team we now know that the mat is manufactured in China in an FDA approved plant . The packaging is also being updated to show the country of origin. < br />< br /> This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review .#### #### ####[([36], [44], 'POS'), ([195], [194], 'POS'), ([203], [194], 'POS'), ([188], [194], 'POS')]

This is typical Cooks Standard . Probably made in China , but quality stainless steel , riveted handles and a tight fitting lid. < br /> This fits my 3 quart pan well .

The footprint is quite small considering how many pots and pans fit on the stand . This is a very sturdy and heavy stand which should last for years . I recommend spending the extra money and getting the factory assembled and welded stand . It 's worth the extra cost .#### #### ####[([77], [83], 'POS'), ([16], [15], 'POS')]

I bought this for my daughter back in May , 2015 . She says it works very well . However there is one problem , the cup sprung a pinhole leak and she had to buy another cup to use with it .

We drink a lot of wine in my home , and at one time had over 1000 bottles in our cellar . As you can imagine , we 've used almost every variety of bottle opener there is , from a simple corkscrew to the most innovative CO2 pressure models . Now I readily admit that I have almost zero skills with a classic waiter 's corkscrew . My favorite opener for years was the 2-prong Butler 's Friend . It was almost foolproof , but it took some strength and skill to use well . Since the introduction of the first &# 34 ; rabbit &# 34 ; style openers , I 've never gone back to the Butler 's Friend . A few years ago we bought our first lever-pull opener , very similar to the Peak Reserve . I loved it and have n't used anything else since . It 's simply the easiest style of opener to use , bar none. < br />< br /> Loving my all-stainless lever-pull as I do , I was a little uncertain that I 'd like the Peak Reserve opener more . After all , my original is all stainless and bullet-proof . After quickly and easily opening a bottle last night , I fell hard for the Peak Reserve and banished my old stainless love to the back of the drawer . This opener has an easy-to-hold sueded grip . In addition , both the squeeze lever and the pull lever are beautiful brushed stainless , giving a softer , more elegant look and better grip than my bright stainless opener . The squeeze lever is substantial and wider than my old model , with a flare that provides a nice surface for squeezing the lever . The pull lever , used to lift the cork cleanly from the bottle , is also wider and flatter than on my old model . The cork on last night 's bottle came out quickly and cleanly , as expected with a good quality lever-pull opener. < br />< br /> To complete the picture of a quality item , the Peak Reserve opener comes in a very handsome black case , nestled deep in black felted foam shaped to fit the opener and the included 4-wheel foil cutter . This is tailor-made for elegant gifting to your wine-loving friends and family . Note to Peak Reserve - please consider softer foam , the opener is held so tightly it 's almost too hard to remove it from it 's case. < br />< br /> If you 're one of those fortunate folks who can open a bottle with a waiter 's corkscrew in 5 seconds flat , good for you , but you should still consider the Peak Reserve because it 's easier to use and faster , too . For the other 90 % of wine lovers , this was made with you in mind . It 's faster and easier than any butterfly or rabbit opener you 've ever used and it 's more comfortable to hold than the extra-heavy all-stainless lever pulls . I highly recommend it. < br />< br />** Peak Reserve provided a sample opener to me with no obligation. ** r is held so tightly it 's almost too hard to remove it from it 's case .

Works well . French fries are cripy . I enjoy them more than deep fried FF . After eating food from the air dryer I do n't feel sick due to the lack of oil . I Wish it was n't as expensive as it is though . I know ... It 's cheaper than the brand name devices but it still seems a little extensive for what it is - a small convection oven . That 's why I have it at 4 stars vs 5 .#### #### ####[([57], [65], 'POS')]

After a few months of maybe once-a-day usage , the timer broke ; it could only go on ( by turning the timer to a time ) or off ( by moving it back to 0 ) . A couple months later , the ability to turn the oven off broke , so it had to be turned off by unplugging it . A couple months later , it broke entirely , and could not be turned on at all. < br />< br /> Also , the numbers wore out almost immediately ; on the first day , they had already started to smudge . It appears that the ink on the knobs for this oven is not made to be touched , heated , or both -- which is unfortunate given that those are their basic tasks . It probably saved the company like $ 0.10 to use the cheaper ink though ... so ... good for them. < br />< br /> It 's not a bad piece of equipment : for $ 120 , I got a year 's worth of baking . But between the terrible ink , the broken timer , and other reviewers' reports of fires or exploding glass. . maybe give this one a pass , get a $ 250 one , have it last you like 5 + years instead of a few months .#### #### ####[([7], [2], 'NEG'), ([3], [2], 'NEG'), ([138], [137], 'NEG')]

I 've had this citrus juicer for 2 years , and have used it to make lemonade nearly every week . It has held up marvelously ! I am so impressed with it that I sent one to my parents . It is very easy to clean , as the collection tray and juicer part that are in contact with the juice can be lifted off to wash . After juicing about 4-5 lemons , you may need to clear out the pulp to efficiently juice more , but that 's pretty normal . Just keep an empty plastic bag by you , shake off the pulp , and that 's not an inconvenience .#### #### ####[([39], [44], 'POS'), ([99], [97], 'POS'), ([51], [44], 'POS'), ([99], [92], 'POS'), ([82], [92], 'POS')]

The next thing I knew the whole system stopped working . I 'm not sure what happened but the motor just stopped .

[[ VIDEOID : edfb3e7050a61e652ea2b978debc88b1 ]] This is the best water , or whatever liquid you want to put in it , EVER. < br />< br /> I have never seen anything like this , so I was a little , I would n't say overwhelmed , but kind of . Just because it was so different that I was like , OK . So this is kind of a gimmick . But it 's not . This is 100 % the real freaking deal. < br />< br /> I do n't like using plastic bottles to drink out of , but finding the glass ones can sometimes be somewhat difficult . I had a Saratoga water bottle that I kept washing out and reusing for about two months , and then it broke because it slipped out of my hand in the sink . I ca n't find Saratoga water in this town that I live in , so I actually have to order it . And THATS a pain ...< br /> I mean , I did it . But it was still a pain . And not necessarily the easiest to have with you whenever you are working out. < br />< br /> So this handy dandy nifty glass and plastic water bottle is freaking amazing . Not only do I not have to worry about it slipping out of my fingers and being annihilated , but I do n't have to worry about cleaning it because they sent a sponge . Which was really nice , and hello . Who has hands small enough to fit into this water bottle , or any water bottle to clean it ? I mean , I have a pretty small hands , but not small enough for that . So the sponge is really handy. < br />< br /> The design is really cool , the glass is inside of the protective plastic cover , and the plastic Will never touch your liquids . Which is really great considering I do n't like drinking anything out of plastic bottles . I do n't like the chemicals that are used to make it , I just feel like it 's very unsafe and I really do n't like putting poisons into my body , especially considering the fact that I try really hard to stay healthy. < br />< br /> I love this water bottle , I am never going to be without it , and even though the company sent me the gray , I appreciate it , never going to use it . Pink is 100 % my color ! And it 's a pretty pink , there 's no way to go wrong with this . It 's different , it 's stylish , it 's amazing , it 's leakproof !< br />< br /> I love it , and the owner is insanely nice , and had no problem talking to me , and I got a really sweet handwritten note telling me that if there was any problems to feel free to contact him . It totally reminded me of the super cute candy store that was around the corner when I was growing up and the owners had no employees . It was just them and they knew everyone 's name . That was a really great time , and I wish that we had more of that in this world . I honestly think it would make it a better place. < br />< br /> I received this product at a discounted rate . I chose to do the review on my own.erent , it 's stylish , it 's amazing , it 's leakproof !

Bought these almost 2 years ago now . I really wanted to give it time before posting a review to see how these held up. < br />< br /> The Verdict : They 're great ! Like anything steel , you ca n't leave it in water or they WILL rust . Even stainless steel . Wash and dry immediately after use , and they 'll last you a long , long time . IF you do end up with little rusty spots , a little Bar Keepers Friend should take it right off .

I have a chronic ( hehe ) health condition which requires occasional pain relief assistance . A personal preference of mine is to stay as holistic as possible with my pain management tactics , as with most areas of my life , so I go green from time to time . However , I 'm a functioning adult with a respectable career and lifestyle and I prefer to be discreet about how I behave in my private life. < br />< br /> I was pleased to find this well made , classy product online and even more pleased when it shipped on time , and when finally put to use , I was notably impressed . It had been a while since I used any products like this ( since the college days ) , so I needed something that was easy to use , and did the job well. < br />< br /> Now , I buy the greens , grind them up , and have everything ready so I can go to my little drawer and have a smooth and painless experience . When I 'm in pain and I do n't feel like making the effort to preparing the stuff , the last thing I want is a sloppy grinder . This is the best one I 've seen in all my years. < br />< br /> My brother actually referred me to the product and he seems to be an expert in these things so I trust him. < br />< br /> Anyway , If you want your greens ground to perfection with no messes or hassles , and you do n't want to lose and keef ( excellent keef storage ) then buy this grinder !#### #### ####[([47], [45], 'POS')]
