I was very disappointed with this . The description said it was compatible with Windows XP , but reading the box when I received it , it was not . I had to pay a little more for Trend Micro which was compatiable with Windows XP . I notice on two PC 's on which I installed Trend Micro , that the computers boot up faster than they did with McAfee 2014. < br />< br /> Since I would have had to pay postage to return this McAfee 2015 , I decided to keep it as the price had been good . I will use this on a Windows 7 laptop which I have upgraded to the free version of Windows 10 . Windows 10 includes Microsoft 's antivirus program Defender which the reviews say is as good as the pay software . So , after the McAfee 2015 expires in a year , I will stick with Defender and Trend Micro . McAffehas lost a long time customer cause they refused to support folks with Windows XP computers .#### #### ####[([45], [138], 'NEG'), ([45], [3], 'NEG'), ([45], [12], 'NEG'), ([14, 15], [138], 'NEG'), ([14, 15], [12], 'NEG'), ([63, 64], [138], 'NEG'), ([63, 64], [65], 'NEG'), ([98], [101], 'NEG')]

Good lord . Acrobat DC is so slow , it 's unholy. < br />< br /> I 've been happily using Acrobat 9 ( yeah , it 's been a while ...) for a long time now , but was happy to bring my version in to this decade. < br />< br /> Out of the box , I was irritated that Adobe made me create an account . I was hopeful that the presence of physical media would mean that I could just install this and be left alone . Not so . Adobe wants you to make an account , but then they want separate activation . Acrobat also seems to phone home a lot , for no obvious reason . Call me paranoid , but Adobe 's track record is not awesome when it comes to security , so I err to paranoia. < br />< br /> Once installed , Acrobat really helped me to get my butt in gear and figure out where the &# 34 ; Turn off notifications for this app &# 34 ; function was in Windows 10 , as it caused the system to chime with a message in the bottom right corner every time the update it was downloading was an extra percent complete. < br />< br /> By the time it was installed and updated , I was really shocked by how painfully slow it is , relative to so many other PDF apps out there now . I 'd understand if I was using something low-end from years ago , but my reference machine is a ThinkPad W541 with a Core i7 4910MQ , 32 gigs physical RAM , and a 1 TB SSD . Yet , it plods along. < br />< br /> Really , the only thing Acrobat DC seems to be good at , is editing native PDF files . It does that really , really well -- albeit , really , really slowly . If you 're spending most of your time editing someone else 's PDF 's ( go ahead , I wo n't judge you ) , Acrobat DC is surprisingly good . Otherwise , I ca n't think of any reason to buy this .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [7], 'NEG'), ([3, 4], [135, 136], 'NEG'), ([3, 4], [237], 'NEG'), ([3, 4], [363], 'NEG')]

I like it . I used to have Windows 7 PRO , and that was a solid OS . I upgraded to Windows 8 PRO for only $ 14.99 . Windows 8 was always a hassle , and since I got it before the major updates , it was even worse . Until around early 2014 , I had problems with windows 8 . But since then , it seems the updates really made it stable and less of a pain to use . Up to the point where I upgraded my PC to windows 10 from 8 , I 've not once ever thought of going back to windows 7 . Windows 8 was much faster , and the new features were very nice . I love how I can sync my desktop , documents , and photos between my laptop and desktop without any work needed . Now when I upgraded to Windows 10 , where did all of that syncing go ?? ? It 's now forcing me to go to the online version of OneDrive because apparently Windows 10 removes the &# 34 ; ghost file &# 34 ; ability , and you must download all of your onedrive files in order to view them . That ruined the whole OneDrive experience for me . Now to Cortana . Nothing to say here , it 's more of what existed before Siri . That voice control that can only do a couple commands , except this one will look up almost everything you say to it , to bing , returning useless results . I do not recommend Cortana at all . Lastly , I 've never had ANY crashing or ANY bluescreens or ANY freezing on Windows 7 , or 8 . Now that I have Windows 10 , my computer freezes often , sometimes every day ! I 've gotten around 3 or 4 bluescreens since I installed it , and it always crashes and locks me out of my account . I do not have a virus , and never have . I even downloaded malware byte , did n't detect anything , nor did Avast or Windows Defender. < br />< br /> I do not recommend Windows 10 to anyone until they fix the problems , and make the new additions useful .#### #### ####[([121], [124], 'NEU'), ([30, 31], [35], 'NEU'), ([30, 31], [211], 'NEU'), ([30, 31], [265], 'NEU'), ([112, 113], [16], 'NEU'), ([112, 113], [116], 'NEU'), ([214], [35], 'NEU'), ([214], [116], 'NEU'), ([214], [211], 'NEU'), ([238, 239], [124], 'NEU'), ([238, 239], [211], 'NEU'), ([238, 239], [265], 'NEU')]

I 've had this software for more then a two years . I purchased it primarily to annotate PDFs documents , as well as for the ability to OCR files . I also though to use it to merge pdf files . First of all , OCR ( advertised as one the predominant advantage over similar software packages ) will only work for a single page , and y must have fast internet . I could n't OCR a single multi page document - it takes forever and then it crashes . Annotation tools really suck - the worst thing is for some reasons it can not recognize text and highlights between the lines . A different pdf annotatator works just fine on the same document , so the documents itself is fine .

Was a great OS about to be ruined by Windows 10 data mining. < br />< br /> Aug 31 , 2015 < br />< br /> Aug 31 , 2015 Update : • KB3068708 Update for customer experience and diagnostic telemetry – This update introduces the Diagnostics and Telemetry tracking service to existing devices . This means the &# 34 ; awesome &# 34 ; windows 10 data mining will be comming to windows 8.1 / 7 . I guess they had so many people that tried windows freemium ( 10 ) downgrade back to 8 / 7 that now they will put their disgusting business practices in these versions aswell . Furthermore gHacks notes that ” these updates ignore existing user preferences stored in Windows 7 and Windows 8 ( including any edits made to the Hosts file ) and immediately starts exchanging user data with vortex-win.data.microsoft.com and settings-win.data.microsoft.com. < br />< br /> Look it up , wake up . Do n't let Microsoft rape it 's customers like this , maybe windows 10 / 8 can be saved if enough people reject this disgusting garbage , if not let Microsoft 's Google style data rape attempt die with their terrible products . Windows is not facebook or google + do n't sit there and let them make it into one . They ruined Windows 10 and now they wont be satisfied until they ruin Windows 7 / 8.1 too with the same anti privcy , anti consumer data mining garbage spyware . Reject this crap or abandon windows for a more respectable / professional OS that actually recpects users rights / privacy .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'NEG')]

I bought this software directly from the company but had so much success with it I wanted to leave a review here. < br />< br /> My boyfriend somehow managed to delete his entire catalog of music he created off of iTunes without having a back-up ( he has one now !) . My tech guy apparently was unavailable and I was at a complete loss . I was a little reluctant messing around with his MBP so I tried DiskWarrior on my laptop with a bootable ( which I installed ) external drive we purchased for this purpose. < br />< br /> It did n't work or maybe I just did n't get HOW to get it to work . I did some googling and saw good reviews for Data Rescue 4 and though it 's not cheap , it DOES let you scan for what 's missing before you purchase and you can preview too , which is a great marketing strategy beause if the missing files are n't there then no money loss nor do you need to ask for a refund . It seemed like they were pretty sure of their product to take this approach. < br />< br /> SO I installed the trial version on the bootable drive , scanned his MBP ( which took 4 hours ) and TA DA ! It was all there ! I was a bit confused when trying to purchase the product ; initially , it seemed that they were going to mail it to me rather than let me purchase the serial number to unlock the trial version I had , but I misunderstood . We paid , got the serial number and everything worked great and it 's even user friendly . There 's video 's to take you through the steps too. < br />< br /> In the end , I 'm glad my tech guy was n't around otherwise we probably would have spent the same amount , if not more , and not have this software on hand which is important when you live with someone who has &# 34 ; Deleting Disease &# 34 ; . PLUS , I got taken out to my favourite restaurant as a thank you so it 's a BIG win , win all around .#### #### ####[([77], [296, 297], 'POS')]

My wife bought me Adobe Photoshop Elements 13 for my birthday . What a disaster that was . I 'm trying to see whether or not I can return it ( which may or may not work out since it is software ) . The program wo n't load on my computer and there is no human customer service available to people who purchase the disc . When you click on &# 34 ; Support &# 34 ; it just opens up a window that is filled with loads and loads of completely useless text . I went online to read about this problem and just found countless posts from pissed off customers who were in the same boat . Adobe has completely failed an entire segment of their customer base .

I had to uninstall it . I 've had freezes , shuts programs off and is generally not an easy replacement for Windows 7 ( which stinks in it 's own right ) . Unfortunate that Microsoft reached their pinnacle with Windows XP . Ignore the techies on the web that say it 's great . Talk to people that have tried to use it and you 'll get the real story. < br />< br /> Windows 10 is free for a reason : Microsoft wants the data from your computer ... and they will get it one way or another . There are all kinds of warnings on the Internet about this scam . You can try to turn off the many , many , privacy invasions by Microsoft , but just because it says it 's turned off does n't mean it actually is . Microsoft lulls you into a false sense of security by making you think you 've disabled their weapons . They even warn you , in the agreement that you have to agree to before installing it , that they will access the data on your hard drive if they decide they want it. < br />< br /> With enough pressure , Microsoft may relent and abandon this effort to spy on you . They may even get the program so it works fluidly . After all , Microsofts' stadard operating procedure is to release crap and then try to fix it after they get all of us suckers to buy / install it . Stick with what you have and watch the web for consistant reports that Windows 10 will 1 ) protect your data instead of stealing it and 2 ) function easily .#### #### ####[([22, 23], [26], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], [231], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], [292], 'NEG')]

The Serial Number that came with this software was initially invalid . No , the 6 is not a G , and the 0 is not an O . Yes , I can read . Yes , I tried all the serial number-letter confusion possibilities , just in case . Yes , it was incredibly frustrating . This software is available for direct download from their site , but I bought a physical copy off of Amazon instead , because I was n't going to give my credit card information to a website that looks like my 12-year-old cousin 's HTTP class designed it . Now , I had to go through their awful site anyway , because - surprise ! - there 's no support phone number . Seriously , this website looks like it narrowly escaped the 90 's , and it wants you to enter all of your personal data - email , address , name , everything - to get any support . I 'm sure it 's very secure ( that was sarcasm ) . Upon delving into their FAQ , I discovered that Windows 7 users could n't use the CD install . They HAD to download the software . This was n't made clear at all , and honestly , Windows 7 has been out for years . At least stick a note into the case or something . Considering the fact that the &# 34 ; invalid &# 34 ; serial number errors I was getting did n't allude to my Windows version at all , I might not have figured that out without having to actually sit on my thumbs waiting for an email response . The software is great and all but the install experience was awful .

The story starts in 2014. < br />< br /> I bought the NovaStor backup system for my laptop , a high end Toshiba widescreen . My order was placed at a particularly busy time in my business cycle and so I did not rush to install the software . I activated it , decided that the instructions were not clearly written and that I did not have time to work on it just then. < br />< br /> When I did try to work through the backup process , I found that the buttons on the main work screen popup are all below the bottom of my laptop display . There is no scroll bar on the right side and the software is unusable . So I wrote to NovaStor 's support people. < br />< br /> The first email I received from NovaStor support had no relationship at all to the problem at hand – nothing at all . Even better , though , I received a &# 34 ; case closed how did we do ?&# 34 ; email survey before I received the whacky support letter. < br />< br /> I replied to NovaStor support and also to the survey saying that my problem was not solved . When the reply came , the technician said that there is no way to use the software without resizing the laptop display . That 's it . Think about rebooting 4 times a day to do 2 backups. < br />< br /> I applied for a refund for this unusable software but my request was denied because it had been over 30 days since my purchase . The Customer Service Dude was rude because I dared to ask for a refund outside of the warranty period. < br />< br /> Why waste your time with an arrogant company that ca n't produce a usable interface ?< br />< br /> 2015 Update. < br />< br /> My computer crashed and when I tried to reinstall Novastor , I found that the serial number was &# 34 ; disabled &# 34 ; . I contacted Novastor to get a new serial number password or other workaround . The customer service department is rude and uninformed , wasting weeks of my time before sending me to another department that told me I had to buy a completely new installation .#### #### ####[([115, 116], [59, 60], 'NEG'), ([115, 116], [114], 'NEG'), ([115, 116], [226], 'NEG'), ([115, 116], [355], 'NEG'), ([123], [59, 60], 'NEG'), ([123], [125], 'NEG'), ([231], [59, 60], 'NEG'), ([231], [125], 'NEG'), ([231], [226], 'NEG'), ([231], [355], 'NEG'), ([266], [265], 'NEG'), ([266], [320], 'NEG'), ([266], [379], 'NEG'), ([284, 285], [288], 'NEG'), ([284, 285], [379], 'NEG')]

S *** . I bought my copy of FL fruity edition at Fry 's Electronics , but I thought it was so deserving of a ... review that I took the extra time to try and save someone else from getting robbed of a 100 $. I was excited when I bought the software , but that QUICKLY faded about 20min . in to using it . Its pretty much a facade of a studio program only to try and get you to spend more $ . Everything is there but all the plugins are \\" locked \\" until you upgrade your edition , cant record vocals , cant make complete songs , cant use most of the plug-in 's until you fork over more loot.The advertisements , packaging box , and videos online are misleading . in this case the BASIC studio edition would be the next step up @ 199.00 $ followed by the SIGNATURE studio edition for 299.00 $ , And finally a 749.00 $ job \\" complete bundle \\" . Other than highly limited , the tutorials are more like commercials , just people showing off their \\" skillz \\" showing what you can have if you pay the premium . FL studio \\" fruity edition \\" is the hook on the line to real you in . If this software were free I would delete . I also checked in to returning to Fry 's but since its open software I 'm stuck with it . And FL wont take it back because pretty much the same reason , ( I could copy the program , and returned the original , blah blah . I do n't believe I would waste a perfectly good flash drive on this garbage ) . And they also claim you should know better because they offer a \\" full \\" functioning demo . News to me . I 'm not normally one to \\" play \\" with demos , because they are just that , demonstrations . I was actually wanting to put the software to use for video score production , and cannot do it with a demo version . And also you mean to tell me that the demo you offer is way more advanced than the actual product a paying customer receives. . And furthermore that 's like saying \\" we 'll you should have known our product sucks from the demo , loser ... refund ?! hahahaha ... NO \\" They do offer \\" upgrade \\" options to the next lever for slightly morethan what you would pay for that version originally . And the little I did mess around in the program , the format seemed over complicated , Not much selections for sounds , and the ones that were per-loaded sounded fake . Cut my losses , got robbed , at-least I still got the old Amazon \\" soapbox \\" to speak from , please do not buy , at-least this version , of this software . But keep in mind most of the versions have some limitations unless you pay damn near 800.00 $ for the \\" bundle \\" FL Studio .#### #### ####[([93], [135], 'NEG'), ([290], [104], 'NEG'), ([290], [135], 'NEG'), ([290], [377], 'NEG'), ([290], [453], 'NEG'), ([290], [468], 'NEG')]

I bought this product several years ago when I was working in South America , but then did n't use it until we started planning for a vacation to Ecuador and Peru . Although I did n't complete all of Spanish 1 and 2 before the trip , I was still able to make good use of the lessons on the trip , in the airport , restaurants , hotels , stores and more. < br />< br /> Each lesson begins with a short conversation in a real life situation in a restaurant or someplace you will encounter traveling . In each , either a few new words or a new structure is introduced . The short conversation is followed by an explanation from the tutor and then exercises where you use the words and structures introduced in the conversation , as well as practice a sprinkling of words and structures for prior lessons . So you learn something new in each lesson , and practice what you 've learned previously . It 's a great system for me and gave me the information to let me build my own sentences with words I already knew . Best of all , it gave me the confidence to speak in complete sentences on our trip .#### #### ####[([177], [176], 'POS')]

Cyberlink PowerDirector 13 is one of the best video editing softwares for the PC . It is easy to learn and easy to use ! PowerDirector 13 offers tons of features at a low price . Features include hundreds of templates , effects , and intros that are relevant to many types of videos . You can even make your own templates,effects and intros that can be saved and used again ! Before this I used IMovie and I even got to work with a Final Cut Pro X Trial . This absolutely outdid both softwares because of ease of use and better features . Extra features include customized hotkeys and picture in picture . I cannot recommend this program enough and it also does n't require too much computer power . Videos also publish in minutes ! At this price there is nothing else on the market to compare it to !#### #### ####[([100], [21], 'POS'), ([100], [98], 'POS'), ([23], [21], 'POS'), ([23], [98], 'POS')]

I 've loved the other 1000 Door games and was eager to try this one , but it is n't as appealing to me . It 's still really well done like the others , but ... It depends on what you like in a game as to whether this will be a favorite for you . The theme of this game is still the mystical house , but the ' doors' go to lands of robots and darkness and the game is more repetitive than the others . The graphics and soundtrack are well done , but the coloring of the scenes was n't a favorite with me -- way too much of that pink like on the cover . There are several ' tools' you earn and use for various things , to heal or fix something that 's broken , etc. , but I got a bit tired of that . I did really like the hidden object scenes that are a new take on that , clever and interesting . The bonus game is rather short . Still , I appreciate the useful ' hint ' button and everything works well .#### #### ####[([92], [94], 'POS'), ([92], [94, 95], 'POS'), ([99], [103, 104], 'POS'), ([90], [94], 'POS')]

This game was written in a rather odd fashion even for the time it was released . It was written 100 % purely in assembly language . For those of you who do n't know about programming , assembly language means a literal representation of a CPU instruction . The way most applications are written is with a high level language that allows some logical structure such as &# 34 ; if this , do that , otherwise that. &# 34 ; With assembly , you have to write down the raw sequence of events exactly like how the machine would think . At the time of MS-DOS era , game makers used a combination of high level language to get AI logic , and used assembly language to write low level functions such as displaying graphics or playing sounds . It 's fairly rare for a entire game to be written in just one language or the other . Of course , none of that means anything at the time since if you had the bare MS-DOS OS and correct DOS version , this game functions flawlessly . However , if you are attempting to run this on a modern OS using a emulator like DosBox you 're going to find the game does n't function at all because of how the game was written . With that said , I was able to get the game running on DosBox v0.74 after doing some research on it . The game does work but you will need to do some things which ca n't exactly be explained in detail here . I could get some sound running and the game does run a tad bit faster than what I remembered . Also , the game has multiple disks and you have to swap them out . What I did was copied the floppy to a folder on my local machine , then mounted a new folder and moved the contents of disk 1 to that new folder . When the installer asked for disk two , I simply moved the contents of disk 2 folder to that mounted folder . Otherwise I 'm not sure how to switch disks . Overall very good for nostalgic folks . As other mentioned before this game acts as a GTA game where you can drive around a very large city . The city is with static data where it comes with a map and you can visit many parts . It 's not a randomly generated city but an actual city of LA . The overall game is similar to the original Terminator movie where a robot has to kill Sarah Connor . You can play as the good guy or bad guy in this game . Just do some research and have a little patience and you can get this game working again on DosBox .#### #### ####[([39], [7], 'POS'), ([39], [214, 215], 'POS'), ([39], [285], 'POS'), ([138, 139], [130], 'POS')]

If I could give this software a 0 , I would . I specifically went to this version because it has inventory tracking , but when they convert from the desktop version it is almost as though they are converting from a different company 's software .

Cook'n is the best cooking software and customer support . I ca n't imagine keeping software compatible with PC and Apple operating systems as new versions are released , but Cook'n is right on it . They clearly care about the product and the customer . Not only do they keep up with changes in operating systems , but they also continue to improve the Cook'n software . While I usually use the software at home , my many , many cookbooks sync through the Cook'n cloud with my iPad and iPhone if I want to browse my recipes when I 'm away from my computer .

I researched family tree software options before making this purchase and was really undecided when I made the purchase . Family Tree Maker allows you to print reports ONLY FROM YOUR HOME DESKTOP COMPUTER . If you use a mobile device and travel , you are out of luck . The syncing with Ancestry is close to worthless because Ancestry does not allow you to print things such as a family group sheet which is so basic . Now , for me , the problem is I spent weeks inputting data and in order to change it would be time intensive . In addition the customer service phone option is horrible . I have called 4 times , each time was on hold for over 30 minutes and when I finally talked with someone it consumed another 30-60 minutes of time only to be given inaccurate information .

My wife and I bought our first ever Apple computers -- MacBook Pro laptops -- and since we already had Windows laptops and an investment in Windows applications , I wanted to experiment with running Windows on our new MacBooks with the future goal of weaning ourselves off our older Windows laptops. < br />< br /> I did not want to spend big bucks on Windows 7 licenses since this was just a fun project and I would not be using Windows in a production environment . I bought two copies of this Windows 7 Home Premium OEM product and two copies of Parallels 7 for the Mac after confirming that our MacBooks run 64-bit. < br />< br /> Once I had Parallels 7 installed on the MacBook , all I had to do was stick this Windows 7 OEM DVD in the DVD drive and tell Parallels to look there . The whole process was a breeze and Windows 7 installed just fine with only one caveat : Microsoft provides the Windows 7 product key in such microscopic type ! It was very hard to distinguish the letter ' O ' from the letter ' Q ' and the number zero . The Windows install process got really far before it bombed for an incorrectly entered product key . It took a few tries of repeating the process from the beginning before Windows completed the install. < br />< br /> Additional Notes :< br /> o I later found that the Windows 7 Home Premium installation has an &# 34 ; anytime upgrade &# 34 ; icon that I presume when double-clicked would allow me to upgrade to the professional and ultimate editions if I so desired . If I had known that I could have saved the time I spent trying to research the differences before settling on the Home Premium edition. < br />< br /> o Windows 7 runs fantastically within the Parallels environment on the Mac . [ UPDATE 2 / 15 / 12 : My wife installed Adobe CreateSuite 5 and Microsoft Office 2010 within the Parallels 7 / Win 7 environment and has used the software without just as if she were working on a pure Windows machine with no performance issues . ] Since Parallels supports more than one virtual session , I am also thinking about running Linux on my Mac . Of course , that is a project for another day.also thinking about running Linux on my Mac .

I am in my first week of use . I am having problems having enough disc space on my computer for processing and burning . Corel 's customer service has been very prompt in replying to me as we work on the problem . It copies beautifully and with good resolution , but after 3-4 tapes I ran into this problem . I have more than 100 tapes to copy and have gotten bogged down . I think I need to get a programmer to get inside the software and redirect the cache , storage and increase the size of these areas . I have m &# 34 ; C &# 34 ; drive ( 125G SS ) down to bare bones and still do not seem to have enough space to work with . Will write another review if we get it resolved .#### #### ####[([15, 16], [12], 'POS'), ([27, 28], [12], 'POS'), ([27, 28], [49], 'POS')]

After installing this program I have now run it several times , at first not restarting the computer and then with restarting the computer between installs . Each time I have run the Quick Scan I have had the same registry problems reported . Since I have been sure to launch the &# 34 ; Fix Problems &# 34 ; each time I would think that after the first run all the problems would have been cleaned up but each subsequent run has found the same issues . I am a real person and this is an honest review . Unless in the past there were versions of this program that actually worked or if I have just gotten a lemon ( which I doubt ) I do n't know how anyone has given this program more than one star . It does not seem to work !#### #### ####[([40], [41], 'NEG')]

I am also a long time Elements user - version 2 , 5 for Win , 8 , 10 , 13 for mac . Wonderful to v8 . Serious problems since then . I 've upgraded only because I 've bought new cameras with file formats unreadable by the camera raw reader . Since there were so many complaints about the Amazon download version not installing , I bought a disk based copy from a brick and mortar retailer . It installs , and unlike mac v10 , the organizer is at usable ( that 's another sad story ) , though the interface has been dumbed down and made inflexible . ( See the review &# 34 ; 10 things I hate ...&# 34 ; above. I pretty much agree ) Update : Unlike v10 , I had extreme difficulty with the editor that made it almost unusable . As installed , it 's slooow . Even with 12GB of memory ( 3x the default ) , almost every mouse click brought up the mac &# 34 ; wait a bit &# 34 ; windmill for up to 10 seconds . The panorama tool failed to match edges significantly more than in version 10 . Using the mouse or pen to switch from a drawing brush to the eraser tool , left a line from the last place on the image to the toolbar . That then had to be undone . It was unable to print borderless . I tried to roll back to version 10 and then to version 8 . Even though I have genuine disk with serial numbers , v10 thought it was an upgrade and wanted a previous version , so I tried v8 . That churned in the drive and was ejected . Unable to get this to work at all on a brand new drive . I then tried a reinstall of v13 . In the setup , it showed the preferences dialog for the EDITOR - there is a &# 34 ; performance &# 34 ; tab that allows the amount of memory used to be adjusted . ( Do n't think this showed on the first install . The &# 34 ; ideal &# 34 ; range for mine ( with 11.45 GB ) was 6-8GB . When I pushed it to above 9GB , the speed and mouse problems described above disappeared . The print problem is because of an issue between the Mac operating system and printer driver . I 'm still rating this a 3 because I think Adobe should make the install read the available memory and adjust itself properly , and because of their &# 34 ; fixing &# 34 ; things in the organizer that were n't broken .#### #### ####[([143], [92], 'NEU'), ([143], [110], 'NEU'), ([143], [148], 'NEU'), ([143], [399], 'NEU'), ([143], [406], 'NEU'), ([89], [92], 'NEU'), ([89], [110], 'NEU'), ([89], [148], 'NEU'), ([89], [406], 'NEU'), ([103], [46], 'NEU'), ([103], [110], 'NEU'), ([103], [399], 'NEU'), ([103], [406], 'NEU'), ([193, 194], [46], 'NEU'), ([193, 194], [195], 'NEU'), ([193, 194], [399], 'NEU'), ([193, 194], [406], 'NEU'), ([396], [46], 'NEU'), ([396], [110], 'NEU'), ([396], [195], 'NEU'), ([396], [399], 'NEU'), ([396], [406], 'NEU')]
Previous versions of Acronis tried to include many whistles and bells and was very confusing to use . This version has finally been made easy to use but it works very poorly. < br /> I can get it to work about 10 % of the time . It just has a mind of it 's own . If you ask it to do a full back up with incremental back ups after that , sometimes it works and sometimes it just does full back ups until your external drive fills up. < br /> If you set it to erase the old incremental back ups after a certain number , it forgets and , again , fills up the external HD very fast . No customer support . Maybe the 2016 version will work ?

AUDIENCE :< br /> If you are a long-time fan of Corel VideoStudio ( VS ) and are trying to decide whether you should upgrade your VS to this latest version of Ultimate X8.5 or not , this review is for you. < br />-< br /> BACKGROUND :< br /> I have used VS since its version 12 ( X2 ) . I loved it in many ways ( especially its special effects ) , and I kept buying every upgrade of its &# 34 ; Ultimate &# 34 ; versions which came with extra contents , templates , and special effect plugins . Concerning for my existing installed plugins that I have accumulated over the years in my PC , I communicated with Corel representatives via the chat popups on Corel website , and I was told that Ultimate X7 and Ultimate X8 could coexist on the PC . So , I purchased Corel VS Ultimate X8 on August 11 , 2015 , and installed it while leaving my existing installation of VS Ultimate X7 intact. < br />-< br /> PROBLEMS :< br /> The installation froze up ( crashed ) near the end , during its plugin installations . The content library ( the listing of shortcuts to your media files inside VS ) was messed up ... After I reset the library , things seemed to work normally , but when I applied some proDAD Vitascene FX filters and attempted to make some customized settings , VS complained about the &# 34 ; Vitascene license &# 34 ; and prevented me from using the effects . I contacted Corel Tech Support via email and received an automatic canned reply on August 15 , and the message reminded me that I could PAY to get a quicker response . On August 20 , I received an email saying ,< br />-< br />&# 34 ; This is a known issue for VideoStudio X8.5 - ProDAD Mercalli . Our Development team is working with ProDad at the moment to solve the issue . Once we have a fix , it will be added to a patch or update so that your software will be able to automatically detect it and install. &# 34 ;< br />-< br /> Today is August 28 , 2015 , and I have not heard anything from Corel. < br />-< br /> CONCLUSION :< br /> This version of Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X8.5 is not ready as a release yet ! Believe other similar negative reviews : both the installation and the VS program crash left and right . Corel technical support is extremely poor now ( although it was very good and responsive in the past ) . Do not let the discounts and their short due dates tempt you to purchase it as I did . Keep your VS Ultimate X7 for now .#### #### ####[([73], [72], 'NEG'), ([73], [219, 220], 'NEG'), ([73], [323], 'NEG'), ([73], [433], 'NEG'), ([73], [443], 'NEG'), ([188], [189], 'NEG'), ([188], [192], 'NEG'), ([204, 205], [219, 220], 'NEG'), ([204, 205], [323], 'NEG'), ([204, 205], [433], 'NEG'), ([204, 205], [443], 'NEG'), ([428], [72], 'NEG'), ([428], [192], 'NEG'), ([428], [323], 'NEG'), ([428], [433], 'NEG'), ([428], [443], 'NEG'), ([431, 432], [219, 220], 'NEG'), ([431, 432], [433], 'NEG'), ([431, 432], [443], 'NEG')]

First of all , this will NOT work with Windows 10 ( or , I suspect , Windows 8.1 ) - the program crashes upon start . But there IS a solution if you follow these steps :< br />< br /> 1 . Go to contentparadise.com & download the &# 34 ; Download Manager &# 34 ; ( you will need your Poser Debut serial number and Smith Micro user name and password ; register if you have n't already );< br />< br /> 2 . Run &# 34 ; Download Manager &# 34 ; and download &# 34 ; Poser Debut &# 34 ; ( application installer ) ; version 10.05 worked for me ( version on disk is version 8 ) . You can also DL content from the Download Manager if you wish ;< br />< br /> 3 . Install &# 34 ; Poser Debut &# 34 ; application installer when DL is finished ;< br />< br /> 4 . You will need to put your name and serial number in again. < br />< br /> This got it to work for me on Windows 10 ( so it should work on Windows 8.1 also ).< br />< br /> I like the Poser line of products , but I subtracted one star for the bother it is to install a working copy on Windows 10 .#### #### ####[([22], [23], 'POS')]

Microsoft did a great job on this most recent update of the windows OS series . To all of the people worried about &# 34 ; privacy &# 34 ; the cold hard truth is that this is the 21st century and you have to walk the line between new features and privacy , less privacy inherently will allow more features and functionality .

There really is nothing better than Office - sure there is OpenOffice - and some others like Hancom Office , but when it comes to a complete package , the industry standard Microsoft Office 2013 ( 365 ) is the best. < br />< br /> I knocked off a star because of the stupid installation I had to go through :< br />< br /> Enough on that - here is where you will have problems installing this product :< br /> If you were a student at a University / College that gave you a free copy of Office 365 ( or Office 2013 ) Pro edition :< br /> The Pro Edition is a limited use product .

AVG Ultimate 2015 is a decent computer protection product for the price . I had AVG years ago and liked it , and while I have tried several other products in the interim I decided to go back to AVG this year . This is a good value , but it requires tinkering to get the settings just right as it is loaded with a lot of nuisance alerts that generally appear in the bottom right corner of the computer screen and features I do not find useful with an interface that is needlessly complicated ( I do not find &# 34 ; AVG Zen &# 34 ; necessary ) . A plus is I have n't seemingly had any real security problems from viruses or other malware since installing this ( it 's hard to determine that with absolute accuracy or course ) ; but while updates are fast , scans seem slow . By far the biggest disadvantage I have experienced is that the startup time of my PC has dramatically slowed since I installed AVG ; it 's noticeable enough that I decided not to install it on my laptop ( which has Norton 360 on it ) . The irony is that a popup from AVG just informed me that my computer is starting up 15 % faster since I installed AVG , which is what finally prompted me to write the review . I do n't know how it would possibly know how fast my PC started before I installed AVG , but when I sit down in front of my computer I am not convinced. < br />< br /> AVG Ultimate 2015 is a decent program at a good price , but I will likely switch when my license expires .#### #### ####[([11], [5], 'NEU'), ([11], [281], 'NEU'), ([11], [285], 'NEU')]

Serial number not easily found.Annoyed , I ripped the front flap off the box , had to tear open the interior and tear off yet another flap ... and lo and behold , there was the serial number. < br />< br /> This is not &# 34 ; located inside the box. &# 34 ; This is located on the back of a flap that is inside two glossy , cardboard covers , and in order to find it , requires carefully dissecting a box and hoping you do n't accidentally tear it , because if you do , forget anyone at Adobe knowing what the hell your serial number is without some kind of photographic slide show of evidence , accompanied by the relevant documents from Amazon.com .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [2, 3], 'NEG')]

Norton Security with Backup is the new name for the Norton 360 with backup software line . I 've been subscribing to Norton products for years and have always been satisfied with the ease of use and security provided . It is too early to tell if this will be the case with this new version , but so far so good. < br />< br /> As other reviewers have said , this product was a download using a product key mailed to me . I had no problems downloading it . I must have received it after the official launch . It appears that the direct download is now available in Amazon at time of purchase. < br />< br /> All the current features of Norton 360 with back up are still there : firewall , antivirus , malware , and phishing protection , password vault , safe web surfing , safe search engine , Facebook page scan , parental controls , start-up tweeking , and cleanup ( disc defragmentation , temporary files removal , registry scan ) . Back-up has increased from 5G to 25G of storage . That 's better than One Drive or iCloud offer for free . Music and ...

This review is for the process , not the program . I never was able to get the program discs to load on my HP Envy laptop with Windows 8.1 . I 'm not computer savvy but really , you should be able to pop the disc in and have the installation process start . I have loaded other program discs on my computer , so I know the issue is not with my drive , but it could be with Windows 8.1 or with my Kaspersky security software settings . After reading the other bad reviews about the lack of Adobe customer service and trying for two hours searching online for fixes to my problem , I returned the product to Amazon and decided to just use the Windows photo app preloaded on my machine for now .

I have been a Quicken user since 1994 . The most recent version I had been using until now was Quicken Deluxe 2000 . It had all the features I wanted . And aside from a few minor annoyances , it worked great. < br />< br /> When I upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 this year , I started having some problems with Quicken 2000 . So , I bought this upgrade to Quicken 2012 Premier to address those problems. < br />< br /> The user interface for Quicken 2012 is not as user-friendly as Quicken 2000 was . There are a few features that had keyboard shortcuts in Quicken 2000 , where I have to click to achieve the same function in Quicken 2012 . I do not like it that Quicken 2012 does n't allow me to specify the share price of mutual fund or ETF when I enter a dividend. < br />< br /> But , I have not had any compatibility issues with Windows 7 so far . And I suppose I 'll get used to the interface eventually . So , I 'll stick with this 2012 version for now .#### #### ####[([28], [132, 133], 'NEU'), ([89, 90], [95], 'NEU'), ([89, 90], [132, 133], 'NEU')]

I am a college student . I taught myself to type when I was eight or nine , but I do n't &# 34 ; touch type. &# 34 ; I only use a couple of fingers and my speed stalled around 45 wpm . I decided to buckle down this summer and learn to type more efficiently . My ultimate goal is 100 wpm. < br />< br /> That said , this is fantastic software . It is really difficult to start over from 0 wpm when you can already type , but this program is a lot of fun - I actually look forward to my practice each night . The lessons progress very slowly , which is actually a bonus because the software is very thorough . With lessons , tests , dictation , and games with multiple skill levels and options , this software never gets old .

If you 're converting from Quicken Windows to Quicken Mac 2015 , be aware that the user interface is not similar to what you 're used to in Windows . You could pretty much customize the side bar and toolbar in the Windows version but there is no equivalent in the Mac version other than hiding / suppressing some accounts . There were errors in the conversion where information in accounts were merged . I 'll have to spend time editing to correct these errors . I also had issues trying to convert Quicken . QDF data to the . QXF version that Mac 2015 can import . The Quicken Mac 2015 conversion tool downloaded from the Intuit website crashed my PC twice so that it would n't start . I thought my computer was irreparably damaged by the conversion tool . Twice I had to restore my PC to an earlier date in order to override the crash . This may not be an issue if you always upgrade to the latest version every year -- I was using Quicken Win 2012 before switching to Mac . Update : After working with the Mac version for a couple of days , I 've decided I hate it . Market value is calculated incorrectly . I should not have to go into the register to track down the problem transaction if there is one . The share balance and market value were fine before converting the file to Mac . I do n't want to go through this every time I upgrade to a new version of Quicken . I 'm thinking of going back to using good old Excel spreadsheets as soon as I figure out a way to export the data intact .#### #### ####[([16, 17], [19, 20], 'NEG'), ([16, 17], [206], 'NEG'), ([36, 37], [19, 20], 'NEG'), ([36, 37], [213], 'NEG')]

I 've been a Quicken user since the product came into existence and this is the first time I 've been disappointed in Intuit 's product . Quicken is still a great computerized checkbook service . But with the launch of 2015 they have damaged the brand by making the interface with your banking institutions and updates unreliable . For security reasons the software had to become more complicated and I was prepared for that . What I ca n't accept is that every 3-4 months the update feature with my banking institution has to be rebuilt or the software wo n't update . Twice now the updates have magically changed the balance in my account within the software making me out of balance with the bank tally . Each time that required a 4 hour commitment to locate where the error was inside the register because it magically just changes or doubles an entry . Updates to the software frequently fail . On the last update the interface with the banks had to be rebuilt and then all of my new imported items started to register as the same vendor . Luckily I was looking for a problem and caught this problem .#### #### ####[([50], [57], 'NEU'), ([50], [161], 'NEU'), ([87, 88], [57], 'NEU'), ([87, 88], [96], 'NEU'), ([87, 88], [175], 'NEU')]

Windows 8 boots up faster than any previous versions I 've used before . I have the OS installed on a 7200 rpm desktop hard drive in my very first gaming pc build and it only takes about 30 seconds to turn on from a cold start ! Compared to my old Windows XP desktop I used to have before this one , which took about 4 minutes to boot up , this is a big improvement . I find this especially useful since I can start up all my games sooner . I also like how they improved the integration between the desktop and start screen apps with Windows 8.1 ; it lets you minimize touch screen apps into the taskbar similarly to a desktop window . Honestly Windows 8 is n't as bad as some people say it is because the start screen is really just a list of all your programs but with the addition of live tiles . It even starts up in the desktop automatically when you have a mouse and keyboard instead of a touch screen .#### #### ####[([53], [4], 'POS'), ([53], [98], 'POS'), ([0, 1], [4], 'POS'), ([100], [98], 'POS')]

I was a little reluctant to move to QB Pro2015 because I had received conflicting info as to whether it would be able to convert my QB Pro2003 data without intervention from tech support at QuickBooks . I had to upgrade my computer from a Windows XP to a Wndows 7 Professional and my QB Pro2003 would n't run on Windows 7 , so I had to do SOMETHING. < br /> I am happy to say that the Pro2015 shipped promptly , installed easily and converted all my QB Pro2003 data without a single issue. < br /> I 'm still getting used to the new interface and some of the changes ( like having to save an invoice before printing it and losing the &# 34 ; Remarks &# 34 ; option when posting payments ) , but all in all , I am relieved that I was able to make this upgrade without a major upheaval . It has all the features I am accustomed to , though the not-so-familiar ( yet ) interface IS taking some getting used to . I find that I am getting used to the QB Pro2015 quicker than I am getting used to Windows 7. < br /> I am also VERY glad I did n't take the leap to the online QB .#### #### ####[([60, 61], [56, 57], 'POS'), ([107], [84], 'POS'), ([107], [106], 'POS'), ([164], [84], 'POS'), ([176], [56, 57], 'POS'), ([176], [172], 'POS')]

I have purchased several product keys on Amazon , and this was by far the best experience to date . Even though you are just purchasing a key , most still have to ship the key physically , so you are sstuck paying for shipping and waiting multiple weeks for the product key . This seller got me the key within about an hour and was quite friendly . I was a bit nervous at first because the price seemed too good to be true , but everything worked exactly as expected .

There seems to be a few reviews here stating difficulties in activation / access to the Creative Cloud software purchase . I have had this membership since yesterday and can report only extreme ease of use . Here is what you get when you order : a small giftcard with a scratch off serial number to activate not only your Creative Cloud membership but also each software you choose to install. < br />< br /> I will update my review as time moves along but so far this is a tremendous deal for the price . Please note that there are sometimes suspect reviews in the Amazon ecosystem attempting you to steer you one way or another . I mean no disrespect to anyone but it is curious that some on this review page seek to lead you to Adobe directly and pay their $ 199.99 plus tax fee over the Amazon rate .#### #### ####[([16, 17], [103], 'POS'), ([35], [33], 'POS')]

Windows 10 is definitely worth the upgrade . It is better than Windows 7 in everyway . I will tell you why :< br />< br /> Fast booting time :< br /> My computer has never booted this fast . Windows 10 loads up almost instantly , apps load up in milliseconds . Even win 8 was n't this fast , sometimes I wonder if my pc is overclocking. < br />< br /> Start menu :< br /> The start menu is new and improved . You can now search for apps alphabetically . The search bar returns , you can search for files and apps and even search the web ( which can be turned off by the way ) . The tiles are completely customizable meaning that you can put whatever app or program on it and take off the ones you do n't want . Those who complain about it are simply too intransigent and just want windows too stay the same. < br />< br /> Multiple Desktops :< br /> This is n't anything new to operating systems but I 'm certainly glad windows decided to make it easy and useful . All you have to do is hit the windows + tab key then you have the option to create a new virtual desktop. < br />< br /> I am bare ...

I recently bought the Verbarrator on a once a year 50 %- off sale the company was having on-line for $ 28 . It 's probably worth $ 28 . The software was simple but worked as advertised . There are videos on you-tube that accurately show it 's uses . I own Learning Spanish Like Crazy audio disks both 1 and 2 . I would rate those 2 products as 5 stars and find them very helpful. < br />< br /> I downloaded the product on-line . It worked successfully and I was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the reviews here . My version wants the 16 digit product code that came with the purchase every time I use it . I contacted customer support and they were aware of this problem . Their fix was for me to disable my virus protection so that this product can access the internet and identify itself or something . That is okay , but that means that this product wo n't work if you do n't have internet connection every time you use it . That is n't handy for everyone. < br />< br /> This is a good product but the programming is average at best and I am just use to better quality with Patrick Jackson and his company .#### #### ####[([31], [33], 'NEU'), ([144, 145], [142], 'NEU')]

Clean Win 10 Pro install on a blazing fast PC , runs smoothly , quickly , I 'm coming to like it more and more . It was time to completely rebuild one of my PCs that had very old hardware and Win 7 . I had choices . Did not want to cling to Win 7 . I wanted the known performance improvements to the network stack , WDDM , etc that came along with Win 8.X without it 's known UI aggravations . I made a conscious decision to purchase Win 10 Pro . At first I hated the tiles until I learned how to customize them and also create my own . Runs very smooth and fast on Intel i7-4790K 16Gig RAM , Samsung 850 Pro SSD setup . No real complaints here . I have yet to get a blue screen , no OS crashes . I did choose &# 34 ; Custom &# 34 ; install option and opted out of all the nosy nelly information sharing settings with Microsoft . I have no doubt that some remain . C'est L'vie . I have read that people doing an upgrade install instead of a &# 34 ; clean &# 34 ; ( fresh ) install can supposedly have slow boot issues . I guess I 'll find out when I take the free upgrade offered on my other two older PCs . One review I just read said it about right : &# 34 ; Look at it as Windows 7.5 and you wont be disappointed. &# 34 ; P.S . Note : Some perpective : I avoided Windows 8.X like the plague as I hated the interface . The interface for Win 10 I can work with . Trouble in Paradise ? I noticed tonight that while Windows Media Player 12 that comes with Windows 10 allows for ripping files to FLAC,etc. , I cannot seem to RIP the songs of my legally purchased Doors &# 34 ; Strange Days &# 34 ; album to my hard drive for my music server .

This is one long boring game . It tool me awhile to even get interested , then when I finally did the game acted up .

I do n't know how this got on our machine , a Windows Vista system upgraded to Windows 7 , but it bogged our machine down and made Microsoft Security Essentials think there was a trojan , Peals.F ! plock , on my system which it was unable to get rid of after several tries and restarts . I finally got suspicious of a program called Webroot which had mysteriously appeared at the same time , probably as a result of careless browsing . I finally disabled it after several tries ( it kept coming back ) and now my system seems to be OK , as in no more spurious messages from Microsoft Security Essentials . To disable webroot open a command prompt window and type msconfig . In the window that opens uncheck all instances of Webroot ( WRSA ) under the Startup tab AND the Services tab and then restart .#### #### ####[([82], [104], 'NEG')]
This was a good game , but there were a few minor problems. < br />< br /> The Game Map is a little confusing , in as much as it is broken up inm layers . For Example in the Map they Show East Wing and West Wing but not where you are . You need to click on one of the Main Map areas and then it will show you a more detailed view . You are the &# 34 ; X &# 34 ; if you do not see it , try another location. < br />< br /> They also do not always indicate the areas that have things to do . They do use an &# 34 ;!&# 34 ; to show there is an action to perform but we found that the HINT Button would take us to activity places that did not show up on the Map as actionable areas. < br />< br /> You can save travel time by Teleporting to locations you have already visited , instead of walking there . If you do not want to use the Hint button , which recharges fairly quickly in the casual mode , when you walk around keep you eyes pealed for sparkles . Do n't confuse the Sparkles with the DUST MOTES that float around. < br />< br /> Otherwise it is a good game , some of the puzzles are tedious which we skipped . There are also some puzzles within the Hidden Object game but the clue to solving it is there as well . Those puzzles can not be skipped so look for the clue , they are fairly obvious . I was looking to see if there was a sequel as the ending indicated that there might be one forthcoming. < br />< br /> We had no trouble playing this game on a WIN XP laptop , with the anti-virus enabled . Some games require that you turn the AV off to install and play .#### #### ####[([20], [24], 'POS'), ([20], [241], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [24], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [241], 'POS')]

The game itself in great , lots of fun and love the way you can select your party from pre generated characters , or create your own from scratch by purchasing them as mercenaries at an inn .

As the main cook in the household ( yes , some of us guys DO actually try to keep our wives out of the kitchen lol ) , I have used this program over many years through the different versions . I have over 200 hardcover / softcover cookbooks as well , and you can probably understand that it 's not easy searching for recipes through my physical cookbooks ( although thankfully there 's a website helping with that now ) . Cook'n makes searching for recipes quick & easy , whether you are searching by ingredient , cuisine or course . You can search through the recipes you already have in the cookbooks on the program ( which you can add to via purchases in the DVO store , or easily make your own ) , or you can search the web for recipes via the program itself . My favourite part of this method is that once you 've found what you are looking for you can capture the recipe into the program , it even captures the photo . I actually have a cookbook I 've made in Cook'n simply titled &# 34 ; Web Recipes &# 34 ; into which I capture recipes that I want to try later . If I like the recipe I move it to a chapter in &# 34 ; Web Recipes &# 34 ; and if I do n't like it I just delete it . Nice and simple. < br /> Cook'n has had some problems over the years and like any software problems and glitches raise their head at times . The wonderful thing I 've found though is when they do happen , the people at DVO really stand behind their product . Customer support is quick , courteous and they really show they not only care about their program , but their customers as well . Updates are continually done to improve each incarnation and the ability to save your recipe collection to your personal Cook'n cloud account is a real gem . If any of you have ever lost work / files when your system crashes you 'll know what I mean . At this stage you might be thinking I seem biased and I wholeheartedly agree :) . When I find a product that works , is great value and is supported by the company that makes it like Cook'n is , I will ALWAYS be biased lol . Great product , great people working for them , great company . Could n't recommend it fast enough to anyone who loves to cook . And if you live outside the USA take heart - I know it states here that it 's only available in the USA but if you live outside you can purchase direct from DVO !#### #### ####[([297], [89], 'POS'), ([297], [299], 'POS'), ([297], [87], 'POS'), ([297], [301], 'POS')]
Acronis True Image is a very good back-up utility . The user interface is straight-forward , and automated scheduling makes doing routine back-ups a snap . Having said that , I have not had occasion to have to recover data from the back-ups , so I am assuming that all is ready and the recovery functions will work should I ever need to do so . I had an issue when a new version of the software was loaded on-line . The system could not find back-up data files it was looking for , so it would not do automated back-ups . I ended up deleting all of the previous back-up files , reloading the original version of Acronis 2015 , updating to the new version , and then running a complete system back-up from scratch . I found that getting technical support for something as simple as a software version update ( which Acronis prompted me to do via e-mail ) is very difficult if your &# 34 ; free &# 34 ; service agreement has expired . Bottom line : I like the product ... product support not as much .#### #### ####[([11, 12], [14], 'POS'), ([54, 55], [24], 'POS'), ([54, 55], [83, 84], 'POS')]

It has a feature that if you have a recipe saved in a type written format - you do n't have to type the whole thing in - Amazing . This software has so many features it is unbelievable . Also they genuinely care about customer service . I actually had e-mailed them a couple of times with questions and it amazes me how quickly they respond . Same day or next . There are video 's as well you can watch on using the software . Out of all the software I own and have used their customer service support is the BEST I have ever had . I have a folder full of printed recipes that I am going to scan and import into cook'n . This is so worth it . Also , as they keep adding features your software is automatically updated . Phenomenal !! !#### #### ####[([51], [76], 'POS'), ([51], [195], 'POS'), ([79], [76], 'POS'), ([79], [86], 'POS'), ([83], [76], 'POS'), ([83], [86], 'POS'), ([93, 94], [151], 'POS')]
I upgraded from FTM 2009 . I love this new one which is similar but it uploaded my family tree of almost 149,000 individuals by itself without any trouble . It had to convert them first because my last program was so outdated and I was nervous but it went smoothly . I have used this program for at least 15 years , upgrading occasionally . I love it. < br /> I did n't order it from Nova because they were at about $ 10 more for a download . I wanted the CD in case I have problems in the future . I found it at Amazon through a company called Wolfreeze . They shipped it out within a few hours of ordering and I got it in 2 days . 2 days ahead of estimated delivery . Very happy with the whole experience .#### #### ####[([39], [42], 'POS'), ([39], [50], 'POS')]

Upgraded from Quicken 2013 to try to get the mobile sync to work . Quicken 2015 would not load the old . qdf files . It keeps asking for the password but will not accept it . I followed their instructions to remove the file password but that did not work . I contacted chat and he tried a few things including applying the latest patches . No luck , so he said he would escalate it and I would get an email with instructions in 7-10 days ! I use Quicken nearly every day so that was a no go . Thank God for Amazon 's liberal return policy , and that I was able to re-download Quicken 2013 from the Intuit web site . Quicken 2013 has been rock solid , but this version stinks .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [136], 'NEG')]

A waste of time , money and energy . Sure , they offer you online help , but it costs you from $ 100 to $ 150 ! So , since I was lost in all the mumbo jumbo , I paid for it . It took the tech two hours and then another 10 hours to transfer the data . And then some of the apps did n't transfer correctly. < br /> The settings were off .... and on and on and on . It would have been easier and smarter ( and way cheaper ) to back the data to an external hard drive , then transfer it to the new PC , and the reload the programs . About the same amount of time , no corrections to make , and the $ 200 stay in your pocket .#### #### ####[([104, 105], [67, 68], 'NEG')]
This is the third recipe program that I have used over the past 10 years , and by far the best . What I appreciate the most is that they keep working to update and improve the software , and their customer service is fabulous .

Microsoft has got to be hands down the WORST tech support experience I have ever encountered in my life . I mean , the absolute worst . Dealing with support on Windows 10 has got to be the most miserable experience of my life . Worse than divorce , even . No joke . Let me further explain that in the multiple , multiple ( more than a dozen ) experiences I had in dealing with tech support on Windows 10 , it was a degrading and insulting experience . I honestly ca n't explain a situation I have had where the tech were more insulting or disrespectful . It has been miserable,and my issues have still not yet been resolved and and I have given them several weeks to take care of my issues . The queue for support is awful ... each time I wait over an hour only to get disconnected after explaining my problem . I hate Microsoft . I never did before , but I do now . This is a masochistic experience to say the least .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [8], 'NEG')]
Based on toptenreviews.com , I purchased Cyberlink Director Suite live because they said it was the best . The program crashed 4 timed in my first 20 minutes of use . The 5th time it refused to start . Frustrated , I asked for a refund and got my money back . Armed with my cash , I went for toptenreviews second best software Magix Movie Edit Pro . I got the Plus version . The program was also buggy and crashed often . Was n't happy . Got my refund . So I tried the third best according to toptenreviews . Maybe I was crazy to do that , but I did . I purchased Corel Videostudio Ultimate X8 . Corel does what it is supposed to do and it does it very well . I had a few questions for Corel Customer Service and they responded to all within 24 hours . So far I am very happy with the product and service . Oh , I film weddings for a living .

I am a 73 year old grandmother who has been using the first Cook'n software since the year 2000 when a copy was given as a gift . I found it to be very people friendly and is formatted in a way that a person such as me , that is not very computer literate can navigate . I have continued to purchase the new upgrades and have found that Dan Oaks and his company are constantly keeping up with modern technology . I have been able to save and print a Family Cookbook using my favorite recipes that I have collected over the years . I do not have a smart phone but with Cook'n `` , I have the program on my Kindle and comes with me wherever I go . I also own Master Cook , and Big Oven but Cook'n beats them all , not only in what the program can do , but the excellent CUSTOMER SERVICE . Of course , my first CD 's customer service was made by phone and spoke to a live person , but I can understand with the volume of software sold , that is now impossible .

I feel that I got a good price for this , as it was $ 5 cheaper than going through MicroSoft , however , when I went to download it , it was not a recognized code .

After getting fed up with Corel 's completely mangling and ruining of PaintShop Pro and the sheer klunkiness of gimp , I decided to load up PhotoPlus X4 . I was happy to find that this application has most of the commonly used editing tools : crop , resize , fill , layering , layer masks , adjustment layers , etc. . I 'm going to give it some more time but my assessment right now is that it is a legitimate alternative to the overbloated PaintShop Pro with an interface that is much more usable than gimp's. < br />< br /> One critique I do have is that if you lose your media there is no reasonable way to acquire a download for the version you own . I would even be open to paying a few dollars to get the media back but they do not provide this . My advise is to make multiple backups and store them in different places including the cloud so that you can restore in the even that you lose your media ... .#### #### ####[([12, 13], [95], 'POS'), ([90], [95], 'POS')]

Expensive , not nearly as good as the windows version ( Hey , they have two products bundled for almost the same price as each OSx version ) and Yosemite has as at least as good cross application voice to text built in .

I 've tried the program extensively and all I 've found is abject failure and suck compared to the free built in alternative . But hey , if I pay another 50 $ , I guess I can maybe try a compatible version of the new gimped software !< br />< br /> What the hell , Nuance ? The freaking Mac OS upgrade was free and you want me to pay half again for your new crappy Mac port or else lose compatibility ? When the OSx internal voice-to-text actually beats your crappy half-assed Mac port in functionality ?

Great data recovery product . Simple and easy to install and use . Every recovery is unique and specific so download the demo for this software first to see if your files are recoverable and also set your expectations accordingly . One thing to be aware of which I encountered is that the default setting for the recovered file size is 2GB , so Data Rescue PC splits big files larger than 2GB into to 2GB chunks / volumes . This is n't a limitation but a default setting that is in place to properly support recovery onto FAT32 Formatted hard drives . Something that was n't clear at first but came up when larger files were being parsed . The good thing is that this can be adjusted in the setting preferences , by setting the file size value to zero to have an unlimited file sizes recovered . The bad , is that this larger file recovery is only supported onto NTFS formatted hard drives . I suspect that if you need to recover larger data files to a FAT32 HDD you would need to first recovery them to a NTFS formatted HDD and then transfer those files to your final destination FAT32 HDD .#### #### ####[([2], [7], 'POS'), ([11], [7], 'POS'), ([9], [7], 'POS')]
It has at least a year of development left , but probably 2 years . It certainly is nowhere near ready for a full retail release , yet , here it is available on amazon . Only 2 routes seem to have the elaborate detail promised ... on the locomotives at least . And still , you go to the forums and the developer seems to be trying to schmooze or beg for feedback . I doubt it truly is a new game engine , given I see the very same flaws I saw in Trainz 12 and then some . Stay away , especially if you 're new to the scene and looking for a new train simulator . TS 2016 has a lot more to offer .#### #### ####[([82, 83], [91], 'NEG')]
I upgraded from Windows 7 Professional and had no problems whatsoever . I feel the interface is elegant and a pleasure to use . I love it . Every program that I had on Windows 7 works fine on Windows 10 . These are the program I ’m currently running on Windows 2010 : Quicken 2010-just upgraded to Quicken Deluxe 2015 and it ’s working as it should , MS Office 2007 , MS Web Expression 4 , Adobe Suite CS4 , Adobe Elements 13 , Adobe Lightroom 4 , PaperPort 12 , ACT ! 2011 , RoboForm , Ashampoo 12 , Norton , and others , but these are the main ones. < br />< br /> Microsoft got it right with Windows 10 . You can tell this is just the start for them and that they will be adding more features and capabilities over time . One thing I wasted a lot of time on , not that there was a problem , but you can customize the startup menu process , features and tiles to work and look as you want . Never having that in Windows 7 , it was just a blast to play around with .#### #### ####[([102], [37], 'POS'), ([15], [17], 'POS'), ([15], [20], 'POS'), ([29], [37], 'POS'), ([73, 74], [169], 'POS'), ([78, 79], [37], 'POS'), ([78, 79], [169], 'POS'), ([82, 83], [37], 'POS'), ([82, 83], [169], 'POS'), ([97], [37], 'POS'), ([99, 100], [37], 'POS')]

Fifteen years ago , when this company had solid engineering people involved , this software was very clean , intuitive , fast , and versatile . I found it a joy to use . Then , somewhere around version 6 or 7 , it began going downhill fast , losing functionality and becoming bloated with ditzy &# 34 ; design &# 34 ; portfolios and superficial options , whereas the basic software capability became much more glitchy , as well as annoying due to reverting to contrived , default conditions that assume a particular application like flow charts . Only clowns who have never had to make anything physically work would have ever made such changes . Also , they made it so you ca n't use your old versions with the files if they are even opened with the newer versions . It 's as though Smartdraw was taken over by a band of cheesy marketers who think &# 34 ; design &# 34 ; only means making graphics for power-point slide presentations , and , so , now it 's just pathetic .

I was nervous trying this product based on other reviews , but am fairly pleased . Software is a little glitchy ( Had one random error on install but kept going and it installed fine ; had a &# 34 ; not connected to internet &# 34 ; error when registering product but tried again and worked fine ; and the program froze once when ending video in advanced mode , but it did save my video - I just had to restart the program ).< br />< br /> I first ran the program in &# 34 ; Easy Wizard Mode &# 34 ; - I did notice that the video and sound did not appear synchronized in the preview window and was alarmed ( seems that is a common complaint ) , however the video and sound are synchronized in the video that was produced . Do n't let that scare you - I think some people see that in the preview window and assume it will be the same in the final version but it is not . Other than that I had no problems and completed copying three videos with no problems. < br />< br /> Next I decided to try &# 34 ; Advanced Mode &# 34 ; - I liked the options here better , especially being able to change the aspect ratio to 16:9 . It looks better in the final product when being viewed on my widescreen computer monitor and I assume on a flat panel television . Also , it lets you select output to fit on a regular DVD . It also lets you adjust the volume with an equalizer ( I added bass - some of the videos sounded a little hollow but that is probably my lousy laptop speakers ).< br />< br /> I have not tried to copy anything to DVD yet , but all my videos play just fine with Windows Media Player and look great ( considering they were old VHS ) . The videos are saved as . mpg files . I am so excited to have copies of my favorite Muppets Sing Along VHS tapes - they are not available for purchase on DVD and my VHS tapes are about worn out and take up too much space . Next up is my 25 year old wedding video ! I will update if there are any problems later -- keeping my fingers crossed . ( I purchased this at Best Buy because I had a gift card , butotherwise would have purchased on Amazon ).< br />< br /> A little tip - some VHS tapes were labeled 30 minutes but went a little over . I had one that cut off before the ending when set for 30 minutes so now I have set the recording time for 35 minutes just in case . You can stop it whenever you want before the timer ends too .#### #### ####[([16], [20], 'POS'), ([16], [299], 'POS'), ([61], [62], 'POS'), ([113], [62], 'POS'), ([113], [299], 'POS'), ([228, 229], [62], 'POS'), ([228, 229], [115], 'POS'), ([228, 229], [299], 'POS'), ([326, 327], [299], 'POS')]

I bought this product ten days ago because I 'm dyslexic and I wanted to &# 34 ; write &# 34 ; faster and with greater accuracy . The same day I purchased a new laptop that runs on Windows 10 . I realized that because Windows 10 is rolling out slowly , Dragon NaturallySpeaking Home 13 software might not be compatible with the new OS . I checked the Nuance Communications website and it confirmed that Dragon 13 is Windows 10 compatible . The thing is , it is n't . After installing the program and performing a microphone check , I found that the software was not only completely unresponsive to voice commands , it also crashed at random intervals . I uninstalled and reinstalled the program , purchased a different headset and deactivated the Cortana application in an attempt to get Dragon to work . None of my attempts were successful. < br />< br /> I sent a message explaining the situation to Nuance 's tech support staff . After repeatedly explaining that I had already employed the above troubleshooting methods online and over the phone and proving that my microphone works , I was e-mailed a download link for what I assumed was an updated version of Dragon 13 . In actuality , it was just an exact copy of the program I had already purchased . The version of Dragon I was sent was also completely unresponsive and buggy . When I relayed this information and my frustration at being sent a copy of a program I had already proved did not work on my machine to Nuance 's tech support , they stopped responding to my inquiries. < br />< br /> Subsequently , I used Google to see if anyone else had encountered the same problem I was dealing with . I discovered that Nuance 's tech support forums were filled with complaints from other people who had run into the same issue and had also been blown off by the company 's tech support staff . It was then that I gave up trying to make Dragon 13 work and returned the software . As near as I can tell , the program worked optimally with older versions of Windows , but despite the lies on Nuance 's website , Dragon 13 is completely nonfunctional on Windows 10 , so buyer beware .#### #### ####[([54], [111], 'NEG'), ([54], [59, 60], 'NEG'), ([54], [118], 'NEG'), ([54], [242], 'NEG'), ([54], [244], 'NEG'), ([54], [393], 'NEG'), ([53, 54], [59, 60], 'NEG'), ([53, 54], [393], 'NEG'), ([106], [111], 'NEG'), ([106], [118], 'NEG'), ([106], [242], 'NEG'), ([106], [244], 'NEG'), ([235], [111], 'NEG'), ([235], [59, 60], 'NEG'), ([235], [118], 'NEG'), ([235], [242], 'NEG'), ([235], [244], 'NEG'), ([235], [393], 'NEG')]

I believe that Norton Security is one of the best software security packages on the market ! Initially , I agreed with other customers about being disappointed that Norton no longer provides the disc . But then I learned that they provide 2-powerful tools ( Free of charge to anyone that wants to use them ) NBRT ( Norton Bootable Recovery Tool ) and NPE ( Norton Power Eraser ) on their website . NBRT allows one to do the same things you used to need the DVD to do , but it 's even more powerful . NBRT is versatile . You can install it on a DVD , or make an ISO , or make a bootable jump drive . When you run it , it updates the file to use the latest signatures for the scan if your PC is connected to the I-net ( I do n't remember the DVD doingt that ) . If you create the bootable jump drive and install NPE on it , you have the option to run either . If you want to know just how engaged Symantec is with cyber security , read &# 34 ; Countdown to Zero Day &# 34 ; by Kim Zetter . They have people working for them all over the world , and it 's good that they do !

I first got this software from my Toshiba external HDD that bundled v3 , which worked smoothly . Then I upgraded to this latest v4 , and I ’m happy to see the new GUI and it works flawlessly still . This software has all you need : Cloud Backup , File & Folder Backup , and PC Backup . PC Backup lets you back up your PC ’s entire HDD , including the Windows OS , all software programs , and documents and photos , everything . You can even make a bootable pen drive . So this feature is a disaster recovery function useful when your PC or HDD crashes and you need to recover the entire system . File & Folder Backup is the regular kind of backup , and Cloud Backup stores backup to your OneDrive cloud account or NTI Cloud account if you sign up . In sum , its ease of use , and its powerful functions such as PC Backup make this software a great value at such good price !#### #### ####[([34], [33], 'POS'), ([34], [38], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [38], 'POS'), ([78, 79], [38], 'POS')]

Windows 10 < br />< br />&# 34 ; Way near the bottom of the Windows 10 EULA , the agreement ties the installation of Windows 10 to the separate Microsoft 's SERVICES agreement which grants Microsoft 100 % access to your computer , including the files you create and your private folders , entirely at their &# 34 ; good faith &# 34 ; discretion ; they also say they will turn said items over to law enforcement , no need for warrant is mentioned .

As stated , it was very accurate right out of the box . The tutorial was only semi-functional on my laptop , and extremely brief. < br />< br /> The headset is of surprisingly decent quality , with respect to the microphone , but lacks adjustability , cord length , and becomes uncomfortable after a few hours . I have a smaller head , for an adult , and it squeezes my ears and head , causing a pressure headache. < br />< br /> It would be helpful to add a better quick-guide in the box , as the one provided is only a card stock fold out , and does not have many useful commands listed. < br />< br /> The new features greatly improve functionality , and only took a few hours to get used to the dictation style .

Cook'n is very easy to use because of their simple , clean design . This is what sold me on their software over 5 years ago . The software contains some of the best features you can find in any recipe program , particularly the ability to capture recipes from almost any source . This feature has saved me countless hours of re-typing the recipes that I find on the internet . Also , some recipes that I find on the internet are uniquely formatted and do not import properly into any of the programs , however the use of the snip-it tool , makes &# 34 ; cutting and pasting &# 34 ; almost automatic . Additionally , the customer service is very responsive , only through e-mail however . They have responded within 2 days with answers and step by step guidance to resolve any issues ( many of which were my own ) . The ability to save all my recipes to the cloud gives me the freedom to plan meals on the fly with either my iPad or android device . I find this useful when I am not planning my meals , but am shopping and seeing what is on sale . Retrieving recipes on the fly assures me that I leave the store with all the ingredients necessary . I have recommend this program to all my friends and I recommend this program to anyone reading this review .#### #### ####[([12], [11], 'POS'), ([28], [11], 'POS'), ([28], [3], 'POS'), ([34], [33], 'POS'), ([120, 121], [115], 'POS'), ([120, 121], [124], 'POS')]

I wish I read all the reviews from Amazon for this product before I paid for the full version. < br /> I use True Image 2015 to back my Mac Book Pro and Windows 8 ( now windows 10 ).< br /> It was behaving fine in the beginning . The headache started after I tried their Cloud service. < br /> I did not need their cloud backup solution since I have my home Synology NAS to backup everything. < br /> I found it is not possible to remove that Cloud backup configuration , and it automatically starts when Acronis starts up. < br /> What 's worse is when I tried to click on Acronis Cloud option , the whole application is frozen , and I have to open up my task manager to kill that process ( same behaviour on Mac ) . Apparently , from my coding experience , they use main UI thread to handle a lot of things. ( lol )< br /> I decided to uninstall it and delete the folder completely on disk and reinstalled it . Again , it seemed to be fine , but today the annoying this happened again . Even though the trial already expired , it says my cloud trial started again . It seems they will keep doing this until I upgrade my cloud service and pay for it. < br /> It almost behaves like a malware now. < br /> I send feedback on their website , no reply yet. < br /> I am looking into some other solutions now .#### #### ####[([119], [110], 'NEG'), ([119], [126], 'NEG')]

Have to say I was skeptical at first after reading the reviews , but what I received in the mail was as genuine as the copy of Win 7 HP I had recently bought at Microcenter . By that I mean the hologram on the inside of the CD and the little cardboard package it comes in . Genuine key as well . Had to activate over the phone ... or you can use the new smartphone activation feature , which seems much quicker . Did NOT run into any refurbisher issues that I have seen in the reviews . Seems its a bit of a crapshoot if you dont want to pay full price , but I was rather fortunate this time . Update ... Should have waited to write this review . After getting all the updates from Microsoft downloaded and starting to put my games and stuff on , I started getting BSODs like crazy . At this point , I thought could be hardware ... could be software , so i started searching for answers . Did n't find any , so I decided a reinstall would be the fix .

Although I did n't buy this version from Amazon , I bought Roxio Creator NXT Pro 3 from Roxio itself . Roxio Easy Creator for Windows XP was the best Roxio ever ! Now , do n't get this software ; it crashes every time . Yes , it has many , many cool programs , but the main Roxio does n't even work ! If they put new cool features , they must make sure before releasing it to the public , that the software does n't have any bugs . What I think the problem is , the many cool features . Put it this way . Real , &# 34 ; cheap &# 34 ; ( under $ 200 ) , Blu Ray media burning software is unstable . If it does n't crash while designing the project , it crashes at saving , closing , opening , and the very worst , the classic &# 34 ; I go out and leave it burning just to save me 3 hours to come back home and find that it hung up at encoding stage just after 30 minutes &# 34 ; . Now I 'm having problems even UNINSTALLING it ! It just takes forever to uninstall the Roxio Secure Burn . Roxio guys , how can you suck so much ? ! And besides , there is an update option which seems to NEVER have one ! At least I had one to three updates with Easy CD Creator back with Windows XP ! I have tried other programs like Leawo Ultimate 7.03.3 ( I think it is ) , but it is so basic that it seems like freeware at editing menus and doing editing in general for their Blu Ray creator . I think Roxio tried hard to push it to the limits , but their version is a buggy one . I 'm so sad with those guys , they had it before !

I have used Paperport for YEARS and YEARS . But since version 12 its been nothing but crash , crash , crash , and no support . Upgrades only come with a limited number of days of support . You get it working for a few months - then it starts crashing again . The biggest problem seems to be its PDF editor which has always been its best feature . I miss is page enhancer , straightener , eraser , moving page order ,... . :( It was once the best you could find . Now it is nothing but a buggy , memory hogging , constantly crashing piece of garbage . Worst problem is that every time it crashes it LOSES your original document . It must delete the old copy before saving the new one - so you end up with nothing and could have to scan your document over again - hope it was n't something emailed to you .#### #### ####[([62], [56], 'NEG'), ([62], [68], 'NEG'), ([62], [105], 'NEG'), ([25], [56], 'NEG'), ([61, 62], [56], 'NEG'), ([69], [68], 'NEG')]

Well , I bought this originally 11 years ago when my boys were entering 1st and 2nd grades ( thought it would be a good way to entertain them in the summer prior to school , maybe get a head start on some math skills and give me a lil time to do my household chores , lol ) . Little did I know that not only would they LOVE the game but it put them a head of their class , making math a breeze . Seriously , I 'm a math freak - but my kids were n't . They got so enthralled with this game that when they returned to school they were WAY ahead . It gave them skills and the confidence they needed to realize math is n't very hard at all ..... 11 years of straight A 's in excelled math courses later they STILL remember the game fondly ..... in fact I 'm on here looking for another one for my 4 and 5 year old boys - I 'm homschooling the second set and I 'm starting them even earlier . BUY THIS , it 's awesome .#### #### ####[([83], [85], 'POS')]

This has got to be one of HER 's most frustrating games to date . I am a long time ND player and have loved most of them , but this one has got to be one of the worse games ever written . I love a good puzzle , but when I need to find a missing piece , that is who knows where , to get a puzzle to work I find that more time consuming than it needs to be . If HER wanted to make a game that was longer , then give me a better story , more interesting characters and more places to explore . Do n't make me go back and forth in the limited 3 locations of the game looking for stuff . Plus trying to get information or help out of any of the characters . I got more out of the Hardy Boys , but even their information was questionable at best . Not to mention they were just too juvenile at times to talk to. < br />< br /> There was also a lot of tedious reading to do , not that I do n't enjoy reading something that is informative or where I actually learn something , but I was disappointed on how many facts of Greek Mythology were inaccurate , which made some of the puzzles impossible to finish without a walk-through or cheat sheet . And I really hate playing a game that requires a walk-through to figure things out . Not only that , the few walk-throughs and cheat sheets that were out on the net varied widely from one persons game play to another . Which made things even more confusing . By the time I weeded through them I was n't sure what puzzles I needed to do and which ones I did n't . Which brings me to another gripe about this game . Why so many puzzles that did n't have anything to do with the game or those that you did n't even need to do to finish the game ? I agree if you love puzzles , this game might be just the one for you . It seems that this has been the direction HER has gone with the past several games. < br />< br /> I really hated to give this game such a bad review and I 'm sure there are those ND fans that will disagree with me , but I have to go along with a few other reviewers , and say that this is one of two games that I will probably never finish , the other one being The Curse of Darkmoore Manor , another sleeper , that got shelved . This does n't mention that I never even bothered with Shattered Medallion because it got such bad reviews and the idea of a reality show was just too stupid to start with. < br />< br /> I sure hope that Sea of Darkness is better , because fullishly I purchased it from Amazon shortly after I ordered Labyrinth . I 'll let you know if my money was well spent. < br />< br /> If HER does n't start to improve their games in the future I will have to start buying more games by Mystery Masters , if you want an interesting story and beautiful graphics that ca n't be beat , even it they are just an H.O.G . Play ENIGMATIS The Mist of Ravenwood and you 'll see what I mean . The puzzle were fun and the on-board help , made it possible for even a 10 year old to get through the game . Something I question about HER 's latest games. < br />< br /> That being said , buy this game for it 's puzzles and not much more . It was unfortunately , a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT for me. .#### #### ####[([229], [287], 'NEG')]

Terrible product - what a step back for Acronis since their early versions . They have added complex features which can mess up the system - in my case the MBR ( mater boot record ) must have got corrupted and system would not boot up smoothly . Also the external boot drive ( USB or CD / DVD ) simply does not work . This is a key feature needed if the HDD crashes or becomes corrupted .

No. It was a universal motorcycle guide the was saved to a Walmart cheapo CDRW . It was n't for my year / make / model of my motorcycle and what really topped it of it had four first generation Atari video games on the disk .

The kicker each one ended with , &# 34 ; See Owners Manual for further information. &# 34 ; That 's the whole reason why I purchased it . If I had the original I would n't have wasted my money .

I am sure a lot of people will be disappointed to find out their new computer shipped with a version that 's already outdated. < br />< br /> Everything works much better than in Windows 10 . I use Excel 2003 and Word 6 a lot and you can expect * huge * performance improvements - those things fly ! I guess my hardware , with a Intel i7 4770k and 16Gb of RAM was not up to the task with Windows 10 . Windows 95 is much more optimized and expect things to run * a lot * faster. < br />< br /> The only complaint I have is it does not ship with Chrome , and you are forced to run some new browser called Netscape Navigator . It looks kind of ascetic but on the up side - it is * so * much faster than anything in Windows 10 and it does not run those annoying flash ads or autoplay videos. < br />< br /> Overall a very decent upgrade over the previous version ( 10 ) .

I 'd give it zero stars if that was an option . As others have written , its an OK service right up until you actually need to do a restore . That 's the whole point of a backup service - reliable CONVENIENT restores . I managed to do a restore last winter after a major hard drive failure but it was way more complicated than it needed to be , customer service was no help and it got worse . I did a partial restore onto my new machine , got my old machine sort of working and wanted to manage my Mozy storage space because I had something like 400 gig backed up . That meant that as I moved data onto my new machine and wanted to back it up I was approaching my storage limits . Since I had that data on two separate machines plus in cloud storage at Mozy it seemed logical that I could manage what I was storing at Mozy but no , its all or none . Their &# 34 ; customer service &# 34 ; droids were completely dismissive of my concerns and were only interested in selling me more space. < br />< br /> Just this week I got a notice saying that my credit card had &# 34 ; failed &# 34 ; when they tried to renew my subscription . I had kind of forgotten how mad I was last winter but it all came back and when I started reviewing what they provided and what they charge for it I quickly decided that I would n't bother giving them my new credit card information . I can get everything that Mozy provided for half the cost with much greater flexibility from Dropbox . The cost per gig is actually more like 1 / 4 but the way it works out for me its less than 1 / 2 the cost I was paying Mozy .#### #### ####[([20], [19], 'NEG'), ([57, 58], [189], 'NEG'), ([72, 73], [75, 76], 'NEG')]

Purchased this as an update to my 2014 edition primarily for the credit score .... that was a waste . It 's only available on a quarterly basis and it 's only from a single credit bureau . Despite the fact that alternatives like Credit Karma do n't provide FICO scores ( and I 'm not convinced this Quicken product is either ) I still find their free services to be better than the functionality this edition provides . As far as the normal Quicken functions go this one is a quite a bit more buggy than 2014 , causing me to lose online services for one or more accounts for weeks and in one case months at a time despite there being no issue on the financial institution 's end . I have also had more freezes during the quick updates than I ever experienced with 2014 . I put 2014 back on for now , I do n't miss the credit score function and I have better luck with my online transaction downloads but I am still seeing transactions from certain retailers fail to populate when downloaded directly or via imported file . I hope they can resolve some of these problems in the future or I will start moving to an alternative like EveryDollar.com or AceMoney or something similar .#### #### ####[([12, 13], [18], 'NEU'), ([12, 13], [95], 'NEU'), ([85], [18], 'NEU'), ([85], [95], 'NEU'), ([162, 163], [71], 'NEU')]

I initially purchased this software in December 2014 . And while I immediately loved it , there was a learning curve and a few minor issues . However , all issues were handled quickly with detailed directions and explanations . It really is easy to pull in recipes from Pinterest and other websites . Yes , there are a few websites that do n't pull in perfectly , but then I 'm not sure there will ever be a software program capable of that . The newsletters are informative and have links to Youtube videos that are very helpful and details on updates and issues . Then there are the weekly meal planner emails and finally the Cook'n club that I recently joined and provides an opportunity to connect with other Cook'n users . I 've worked with software engineers and I know that you can load software on three identical machines and have it behave differently on each one .

StartWrite 6.0 is a pretty wonderful program that lets you completely customize your child 's learning experience .

I can add clipart , either through the library that comes with the program or with my own bitmap images on my computer . Overall , it 's fairly easy to use and navigate . The text boxes can be a touch frustrating to work with when you have several of them , but it 's a minor inconvenience when you consider what you get in return .

I 'm a high school student , and the past two years I took graphic arts classes . We mainly used Photoshop CS4 . I thought it would be a good idea to purchase Photoshop for my laptop so I could work on my own art from home or school . Since CS4 has a very large price tag , I decided to go with Elements 13 , as it was on sale at the time and it was a very affordable price . It does n't have all the features CS4 has , obviously , but it works nearly as well . It 's perfect for someone who is n't a serious or professional artist . I use it to work on my drawings and other designs . It 's a great product that is very easy to navigate and use . The only complaint I have is that Elements only seems to work on an Internet connection . Other than that , I definitely give this five stars !#### #### ####[([82], [137], 'POS'), ([65, 66], [101], 'POS')]

So I can only give you my impression based on upgrading three PC 's to Windows 10 . One had Windows 7 SP1 , the other two Windows 8.1 . All three have been downgraded back to their respective original OS systems . My only description I can think of for Windows 10 at this stage is half baked. < br /> It needed to be tested further and unfortunately the PC makers also dropped the ball on getting support out there . Maybe the new PC 's coming out with Windows 10 are more stable ? I ca n't say myself . But I will say free or not , I am done trying to get Windows 10 to run correctly . Its just not worth it and I did clean installs with my own USB install tool created using the Microsoft USB creator . Its probably very similar to this product only this product you get a key to activate . I hope others have better luck but 0 out of 3 success is not very good. < br /> As far as what I gained from using Windows 10 when it did not crash or stop working . Was that the UI is rather bland , the whole Cortana search feature is over hyped and the privacy issues are a real concern as well as the forced updates which never seemed to always install correctly. < br /> I really was not so negative at first with Windows 10 . I had high hopes for the OS and hoped it fixed a lot that was wrong with Win 8 . But personally I would wait to see if things get better or worse with fixing the many nagging issues that are happening .#### #### ####[([20, 21], [125, 126], 'NEG')]
I bought this operating system to run on a Mac via Boot Camp . It took quite a while to install , but once installed , it proved to be very interesting and also very easy to use . Internet access and setup were very easy . The interface is different from Windows XT , but was easier to learn . Loading programs was a snap . Once I got photos into the Windows side , then I found that customizing the desktop was very easy . I have to run Windows when I run certain programs , such as iLevel 's Forte , since there is no Mac version . But this latest , and best version of Microsoft 's OS makes it far less painful . Once nicety is that this version of Windows comes with Windows Defender built-in , to help the age-old problem of Windows being vulnerable to malware . If there is anything I have against Windows , it 's the large amounts of updates I encounter when I sign into Windows . It 's rather annoying and the updates take a long time to load .#### #### ####[([39, 40], [45], 'POS'), ([39, 40], [85], 'POS'), ([48], [35], 'POS'), ([48], [45], 'POS'), ([48], [57], 'POS'), ([37], [35], 'POS'), ([37], [45], 'POS'), ([37], [57], 'POS')]

Note : this review is based off of a user who used it in Windows 8.1 64 bit. < br /> It really has n't done me much good at all ... . And certainly was n't worth the headaches. < br /> I got it because I had a problem with doing the same functions via Command Prompt and Simple Shell . As well as whatever the &# 34 ; recovery &# 34 ; tool is Lenovo sends with their systems . But ultimately I could n't get hardly any functions of this software to work at all . At least not to any extent that made me satisfied . Cloning disk never worked . Took a lot of repeated tries to construct a single ISO file , I had to make an ISO on every storage space possible to try to burn onto a new hard disk , ultimately booting into Acronis to do other functions yield fruitless ... To the point where cloning disks asked me to buy the full version (.... seriously ) , and a lot of storage devices and hard disks I wanted to select to burn an ISO to / from would not be visible or unselectable from whatever list ( s ) . All I wanted to do was transfer the OS to a new SSD . Ultimately I purchased Windows 10 Pro via USB for $ 200 for a couple of reasons , but partly out of fear if I did an upgrade and could n't recover from any ISO files at all , I 'd be screwed and have to buy an OS anyways . Partly because Lenovo and other manufacturers insist on &# 34 ; cutting costs &# 34 ; by not shipping a 0.58oz CD with their 128oz desktop . Some of this I suspect might have to do with having a faulty motherboard , which I have no way to test , but the BIOS seems to operate fine. < br />< br /> After installing windows 10 I gave the cloning option a second try ( since I have two SSDs ) and for whatever unexplainable reason , Win 8.1 was successfully cloned to the SSD without being prompted to purchase a full version of the software. < br />< br /> All in all I dislike this software through and through . The boot up with Acronis function gets in the way of so much . It has an annoying cursor in the middle of the screen that does n't function with the mouse at all , and it is difficult to navigate via arrows and TAB . And it causes the restarting and shutdown actions to take a couple minutes to perform . So I just hold the power button on my desktop to turn it off instead . I 'll be uninstalling this the next time I open 8.1 . I hope I never feel the need to use it again. < br />< br /> Oh , and I 'm pretty sure their &# 34 ; customer support &# 34 ; is limited to forum discussions . Good luck - with that. < br />< br /> Worthless piece of trash.t is difficult to navigate via arrows and TAB . And it causes the restarting and shutdown actions to take a couple minutes to perform .

I purchased the upgrade for Windows 10 directly from Broderbund site ($ 27.14 DVD , a bit pricey for this update ) . It was n't a smooth install and does work fine with Windows 10 , but that seems to be the extent of the revision . Printing has n't been a problem . Biggest caution : only a handful of annually repeating events carried over . All the recent events I 'd entered and my previous calendar history was GONE !

I did not get a FREE version . I bought a Premier software directly from the Avast web site on 8 / 2 / 2015 $ 59.99 for a year . I bought this software instead of using FREE version so I can get support if I have any problems . It seems like a good anti-virus software . This company keeps sending me notification to get other products . Finally on 8 / 19 / 2015 , I bought Avast Clean for $ 35.99 . I ran this software thru my PC . After that , I got &# 34 ; Invalid Value for Registry &# 34 ; . This means that ( 2 of many problems , just to give you examples ) I could not listen to music such as . MP3 and could not viewed picture such as . JPG . My PC would not recognize pictures / music on my C drive or USB drive . I am using window 10 with my new computer ( got this LENOVO PC as X-mas present to myself last year ) . My computer is less than a year old . I call 24 / 7 tech support twice . Bother times , these reps gave me &# 34 ; not my problem attitude &# 34 ; . They told me to pay another $ 179.99 for them to help fix the problem . My PC was running fine until this clean . It might be co-incident with my PC after running their products . They are NO help at all . I was very upset and regret that I bought their software . I spent all day ( skipped work ) fixing this problem by following instruction from three difference window forum web sites . However , nothing worked ! Finally , I called my good friend who is a DBA of a big company in my town . He came over and used Wise Registry Cleaner ( FREE software ) on my PC . Everything is working great ( back to normal ) . As soon as my one year end , I will buy different anti-virus software due to Horrible customer service . btw , I send this company my review directly to their web site .

installation was smooth and it works well . We had this product already on our laptop , as it came from Dell loaded , but the renewal cost was too high . ( as a reminder - turn off automatic renewal since you will get hit with the highest price possible ... that is true for all of them , not just Mcafee ) . Anyway , since the product seemed to work well , we went the amazon route , and it worked out fine . This seems like a cost efficient way of extending security coverage . If I knew that the providers would renew their product coverage at a competitive price , I would use auto renewal , but thats not the case . So this is a good alternative .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'POS'), ([0], [92], 'POS'), ([0], [6], 'POS'), ([5], [6], 'POS')]

This game was a disappointment . Having played the other two House of 1000 Doors , I had expected better . The story line is not strong and the main character Emily from the other two games is sidelined by a new character . The graphics are the worse ever and the characters physically unrecognizable .

I purchased Crack DAT a few years ago to help me prepare for Dental Admission Test . My Thinkpad laptop could not maintain a stable internet connection , so I had to reinstall my Windows operating system . While I gained my internet connection back , Crack DAT ( specifically Neil ) does not want to reissue me a new licence key , eventhough I am asking to reinstall Crack DAT on the same laptop it was originally purchased for . Neil wants me to register for the DAT first before reissuing a new licence key . The DAT test registration is nearly $ 400 and I am not sure , when I will be ready . He has no right to ask me to register for the DAT before reissuing a new licence key . I sent him an e-mail today with screenshots from my phone showing that 5 days ago I purchased DAT Achiever and paid $ 139.99 to prove that I am planning to take DAT , but not trying to scam the Crack to get a new licence key for someone else and give away my laptop .

Worked well for what I wanted to do , but was missing key elements that I did n't noticed until I was completed editing my video and thus did n't want to re-do the entire thing using another software package . One of these things included the ability to reverse ( play backward ) a video on the timeline.I had to use a third-party ( mercifully free ) application to do it . Also , it do not have the ability to normalize audio to take out the extreme changes in volume between clips and between the music and dialog . There was an option to raise and lower the volume on the audio , but I did n't notice any changes when applied . There are other video editing software at the same price that do these things . If I would have done more research , I would have bought one of those instead . Also , it was n't the most intuitive software either . It took me a while to figure out how to shift items on the timeline without having to move everything over manually. < br />< br /> All and all , it did what I wanted it to do and it had good transitions and video effects .#### #### ####[([165], [164], 'NEU'), ([165], [11], 'NEU'), ([165], [210], 'NEU')]

While obviously computers have advanced quite a bit since then , this is a great introduction to the concept of typing .

This game does seem to have what it takes to help kids learn there grammar , spelling , punctuation and more ; however I cannot get my 8 year old interested in this one . I am not sure why because it does to seem to be interesting to me . This game is a battleship-style game and my son has never played that game so that may just be the setup that he does n't seem to care for . I do think this game would help children that enjoy playing games that are like a battleship-style . My son does not struggle to much when it comes to spelling or reading so maybe this is just not a game for him but would be very useful to another child . This game does offer parent tools that help parents monitor kids' progress and performance and adjust their levels and even create custom content collections . This game is recommended for ages 5 and up and it is up to 4 players .

Update over the original review . The problem I had was with the dual core processor -- I7-5500U -- which just could n't handle the processing requirements of this software . In fact that configuration was giving me problems with other software so I returned the laptop and purchase one with more horsepower -- i7-5700HQ -- installed VideoStudio with its extra content and everything has been working fine . I should have updated this sooner . Btw , updating to Windows 10 from 7 or 8.1 can be problematic , especially if one 's rig has a lot of OEM components . Recommend backing up all data before proceeding with that . I am reacting to a comment on this review . As to Ultimate X8 itself , it works fine now for my walk thru videos . I have even been able to insert audio files ( music ) for some of my montages . It definitely delivers the bang for the buck . At the current price ( something new must be coming out ) this product is a steal . Read my original review below to understand the issues of using this with an under-powered PC . Original : My system is above the minimum requirements . I-7 5500U processor at 2.4ghz turbo to 3.0ghz , Intel 5500HD integrated graphics and Nvidia Geforce 940M , 16gb RAM . FIrst time I opened after install , not all of the extras loaded . When I ran the program doing a simple voice over , preview screen would freeze after about 30 seconds and the program would crash . ( stopped working message ) . I rest compatibility to Windows 8 and the same thing happened . I let the compatibility troubleshooter run and it reset some of the settings . Test resulted in longer voice over processing but preview screen had much garbage on screen making it almost impossible to view . Note that the troubleshooter diagnosed the problem as &# 34 ; incompatible program. &# 34 ; Windows 10 problem ? Corel problem ? Who knows , but Corel advertises 8.5 as working with Windows 10 and to me it clearly does n't . Update : Uninstalled and reinstalled just the basic software -- no extras . Iwas able to do a simple voice over with no audio from the input media , but as soon as I turned on audio , the software &# 34 ; stopped working &# 34 ; again . Very frustrating . My advice stands . Do not buy . Update : Just went in and tried again and program crashed after I reset settings to allow audio during voice over . Very depressing . I am going uninstall . reinstall and try again without the extras , but regardless , my advice remains . Recommendation is to not buy this product or upgrade to Windows 10 until these issues are fixed .#### #### ####[([80, 81], [88], 'POS'), ([229], [67], 'POS'), ([229], [88], 'POS'), ([229], [130], 'POS'), ([229], [268], 'POS'), ([229], [418], 'POS'), ([229], [438], 'POS'), ([256, 257], [67], 'POS'), ([256, 257], [130], 'POS'), ([256, 257], [418], 'POS'), ([266], [268], 'POS'), ([310, 311], [67], 'POS'), ([310, 311], [88], 'POS'), ([310, 311], [418], 'POS'), ([340, 341], [88], 'POS'), ([406], [268], 'POS'), ([406], [410, 411], 'POS'), ([437], [67], 'POS'), ([437], [130], 'POS'), ([437], [418], 'POS'), ([437], [438], 'POS')]

I like the software . I do n't like the fact that if you divided your money among several heirs , you would use only fractions .

I had my doubts at first , but since I urgently needed an original OS to install on a second-had computer I just had bought I took my risk with this one .

I have really been enjoying using this . I had dabbled in learning German before , but it never seem to stick . The PC program makes it fun and easy going over basic words and offering a few word learning games to play that I enjoyed playing . There is slightly harder card turn over game as well as a flash card type game where you pick a visible card that is the word that is said . I ended up playing for about an hour and time just flew by. < br />< br /> The box also comes with 16 discs worth of MP3 audio on a disc and a DVD video learning program . I was not a fan of the DVD Video learning program mostly because trying to control it felt clunky , but as mentioned I did enjoy the PC program , and you get a lot of Audio learning . Over all I am happy with it so far and starting to learn some basic words . it really makes it feel like it is going to stick , and it does not hurt that it was way cheaper then RS .#### #### ####[([146], [28], 'POS'), ([146], [30], 'POS'), ([146], [143], 'POS'), ([24, 25], [28], 'POS'), ([24, 25], [30], 'POS'), ([24, 25], [143], 'POS'), ([61, 62], [136], 'POS'), ([125, 126], [136], 'POS')]

I 've used Cook'n for about 6 years and have gone through several revisions . Recently my laptop crashed and after several attempts was unable to reload Cook'n . The Cook'n technician was very helpful and patient while assisting me vial emails , with the download on my new computer. < br /> I have become dependent on this program for the organization , easy access , and ability to email recipes . Now with the easy &# 34 ; capture &# 34 ; feature I can transfer a recipe from most websites to my Cook'n cookbook with ease and minimal typing . The only reason I did n't give this a 5 star was because it seems to take a while for the program to boot up when I open it . I 'm assuming it is because of the web search interface features that it now has . Of course that could be just my internet service. < br /> Give this a try . This company is easy to communicate with through their email and respond quickly if there happen to be any issues .#### #### ####[([31], [34], 'POS'), ([31], [64], 'POS')]
Let me tell you why you should not buy this product -- you are limited to a certain number of installs of this software ( another review said it was 5 , but I believe I only got 2 ) . After the limit , you are at the mercy of having to call or email ABBYY to have them give you another code for activating the software . They have an online activation feature , BUT DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE DEACTIVATION FEATURE . Meaning that if you install this software , like I did , on your work computer and personal laptop , if you then get a new computer at work or a new personal laptap you cannot re-install the software ( as you used your two installs ) without explaining yourself to ABBYY and getting a new code . This is ridiculous . While , for example , you also are limited to a certain number of installs with Adobe Acrobat Pro , there is a deactivation feature which allows you to seamlessly deactivate the software on one computer , and then reinstall on another . Trying to get a new code from ABBYY is easier said then done . They actually prompt you to call Moscow Russia at their headquarters for assistance ! !#### #### ####[([123], [145], 'NEG')]

I bought Elements 13 for a 2010 iMac running OS 10.10 Yosemite ; while the Editor has worked without problems , the Organizer has crashed every time I tried to build a catalog of images . I 've tried everything I could think of ( fix permissions , reinstall Elements , new catalog , even a new user account ) , but nothing has worked . Initially I was able , after a 5 or 6 hour wait , to get through to an Adobe online tech who , after getting online access to my computer , told me the problem was beyond him but that his senior tech person would get back to me . It never happened ( case number : 0186630235 ) , in spite of many unanswered emails , and I see that I can no longer get access to any person-to-person support from the company .

Buyer Beware ! I was on the verge of purchasing the Lightroom 6 standalone product when I discovered the following : Adobe is in the process of moving its products to a subscription-only based business model . The subscription-based version of Lightroom , for which you will pay a monthly fee and never actually &# 34 ; own &# 34 ; the product , will be updated regularly with both fixes and new features . The standalone product ( which is this one ) will get only fixes . You will have to wait until the next major upgrade ( i.e. version 6 to version 7 , although it appears uncertain they will even continue a standalone version at all after this one ) to get &# 34 ; new &# 34 ; features . Already there are complaints from users that 2 months after the release of version 6 , Adobe has added new features to the subscription version ( like the haze filter ) that you cannot get on the standalone . So just be aware of what you are getting ( or not getting ) with the stand-alone version of this software . It 's a very good product - but I give it a single star rating for what I would consider a lousy business model for the amateur-semipro market .#### #### ####[([219], [217], 'NEG'), ([219], [1], 'NEG'), ([219], [72], 'NEG'), ([219], [129], 'NEG'), ([163, 164], [217], 'NEG'), ([163, 164], [72], 'NEG')]

I have the old version and like it better . It had less information but I found it much easier to use . Upgrades are n't always better . I think about the cliche &# 34 ; keep it simple stupid &# 34 ; . I do n't believe that all the information in the world should be included in a program . Some should be optional . This program has too many books and too much information. < br /> I found it much more difficult to add my own recipes and to print in the font that I like .#### #### ####[([23], [86], 'NEU'), ([69], [86], 'NEU'), ([21], [19], 'NEU')]

I have been running a Windows 10 for roughly 4 hours now. < br />- Cortana is neat but not very useful , 90 % of requests open an internet tab. < br />- The password login feature is annoying , if someone manages to break into my home just to use the internet I have bigger issues then the safety of my music library. < br />- I have no desire to link my computer to a Microsoft account , in no way will that offer any advantage to my computing experience. < br />- The forced automatic updates , I will chose what and when to update my system . I am not inept and do not need a babysitter. < br />- A few of the apps I tried are terrible , based for a phone platform and useless for desktop environment . The websites are easier and more sleek. < br />- The split control panel , no . One place for everything , they way it has been on every single OS in the past. < br />- OneDrive , I will not use it . I can manage my files , I do not need your help . They invented these nifty things called flash drives to move files around . I do n't want to see the ugly icon everywhere. < br />- Interface , resembles the hideous Windows 8 , 8.1 . Supposed to be &# 34 ; modern &# 34 ; closer to lazy. < br />< br /> In short I am staying with Windows 7 on all computers in my home .

I have no credibility writing a review of Windows OS versions . I 've used Linux as my main OS for 18 years . I bought Windows 7 because I wanted a currently supported version to install a few Windows programs that have no Linux equivalent and which are no longer supported in WinXP : tax software , photo editing software from Canon and WordPerfect ( 1000 % better for my purposes than MSWord ).< br />< br /> This installed in Virtualbox , got tweaked to accept programs I wanted to run , and seems fine . I claim nothing more or less for it .

This is my experience and is just a suggestion . Others may have different experiences . It is a great program , just make sure if you have Yosemite , that you upgrade iPhoto before installing this . If you do n't , you might have issues with iPhoto after installing this . Also do custom installation , and only install the components you are missing . If you do install it , and have trouble , go to the app store and look under purchases and reinstall iPhoto , or update through the app store .#### #### ####[([20], [19], 'POS'), ([33], [32], 'POS'), ([33], [87], 'POS'), ([48], [46], 'POS'), ([88], [46], 'POS')]

This software just fine to allow me me to upgrade my windows to windows 7 . My advice is to always hunt for the best price on windows . It surprising how much difference these can be . Buy from a seller with four stars or better average . And read the ad carefully . Some are upgrades with very specific requirements . Some are just keys , and you 'd better make sure you can download the package somewhere . Usually an install cd costs extra . My other advice is to make that emergency recovery disk immediately !#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([83, 84], [3], 'POS')]

I have been using Cook'n for the last 6 or 7 years . I was using Master Cook before and there is absolutely no comparison . Ok , I have had a few minor issues that came up over the years , but I just needed to send an email to the great customer service / support staff and within 24-48 hours I always received an answer that solved my problem ( most of the time the problem was something I caused ) . I just upgraded to the prerelease Cook'n 12 on 8-18-2015 . What a great looking and easy to use recipe organizer ! I have over 14,000 recipes in my Cook'n program and of course they are all seamlessly saved in the Cook'n cloud . I also have an older computer that I use as &# 34 ; my backup &# 34 ; , of course I have n't had to use it since everything is saved in the cloud . I have used snap-it and internet capture almost daily since became available , sure takes the work out of adding recipes to my cookbooks !< br />< br /> Back to the prerelease Cook'n 12 , this is to be updated weekly with enhancements up to the regular roll out of the program .

Verbarrator was given to me as a gift . The serial numbers , if included , are not working . I installed my first copy , which took 30 minutes . I could not use it because a serial number was not included at all . I submitted a support ticket through their website requesting a serial number . I waited two days without an answer . I had to tell my friend that the gift did n't work , and he had to contact Amazon , and Amazon sent another copy . The second copy had a serial number , but the serial number on that second copy did not work . I re-typed it several times . I tried both upper-case and lower-case . I tried uninstalling and reinstalling with the new disc . Nothing worked . I emailed Learning Like Crazy 's support and waited one more day without an answer .

Terrible . I paid 70 dollars for this program because I 'm a naive , over-enthusiastic med student .

Those two items FAR surpass everything that this piece of garbage software offer . This program may have been good in the year 1998 but it 's ridiculous that it is still so expensive. < br />< br /> Medical school is expensive enough - do n't buy it . Do n't do it .

For some reason I like printed manuals but the info. is there on the welcome screen .

Adobe Premiere Elements 13 is very slow on a high performance i7 laptop . When I try to resize the application window to fit my large secondary screen , the application window &# 34 ; jumps &# 34 ; back to my smaller laptop screen . Lastly , the application hangs or crashes sometimes causing work to be lost . It is suspicious when an application implements an &# 34 ; auto save &# 34 ; feature to be able to recover from abnormal program terminations . When the auto save failed to recover several hours of work , I decided to uninstall it and try a different video editor .#### #### ####[([31], [6], 'NEG'), ([31], [50], 'NEG'), ([31], [52], 'NEG'), ([31], [62], 'NEG'), ([31], [91], 'NEG'), ([90], [6], 'NEG'), ([90], [50], 'NEG'), ([90], [52], 'NEG'), ([90], [62], 'NEG'), ([90], [91], 'NEG'), ([0, 1], [6], 'NEG'), ([30, 31], [6], 'NEG'), ([30, 31], [62], 'NEG'), ([30, 31], [91], 'NEG'), ([49], [50], 'NEG'), ([49], [52], 'NEG'), ([89, 90], [6], 'NEG'), ([89, 90], [62], 'NEG'), ([89, 90], [91], 'NEG')]

I love that I can find recipes on Pinterest and add them to my recipe book on Cook'n . Additionally , if I ever have a glitch in the software , I just send an email to their tech support , and I have an answer and solution to my issue very quickly .

First of all , let me say that I am not a traditional student . I am 45 raising three kids and have had the opportunity to go back to school . Times are very tight these days making sure that the rent gets paid along with food on the table and then there is the cost of school etc etc etc . With that said , I have been using a fairly new computer . It is currently about a year old . It did have the windows 7 operating system installed on it . I liked it just fine . I do n't need all the bells and whistles that come with the new and improved versions of anything . I was given the offer to install the windows ten version for free . I figured why not because I understand that you need to keep your computers updated . The system loaded fine . Then school started later in the week . I quickly realized that I could not download documents from the instructors because my word program had now been corrupted . I called customer service only to be told it would be four and a half hours before they called me back . So , I kept trying to figure the issue out . Finally a prompt came up give me back the windows 7 I had before . I figured , why the hell not . I liked it before and this system is eating my school work . Besides the prompt said it would be &# 34 ; easy. &# 34 ; I clicked the button and that is when all hell broke loose . Long story short , when Microsoft finally called me back six and a half hours later it was already too late . My computer is completely fried . I am all the way back to the factory settings . Microsoft told me to contact the person I purchased it from to see if I can get the disks back . I no longer have the word program on my computer either . I HAVE SCHOOL right now , I do n't have the time to chase down disks etc . Thanks Microsoft , the program looked great if I want to listen to music , check email or surf the web . I need my computer for school ! I will turn on the radio if I want music , I will click that other button to check my mail , and I will chick the yet another button to surf theweb . Please do not do me any favors to make my life easier , you have already made it hell . Here is a thought , why do n't you send me the word disk since it is your program anyway . I am sure you have billions laying around .#### #### ####[([88, 89], [155], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [378], 'NEG'), ([153], [155], 'NEG'), ([153], [378], 'NEG'), ([179, 180], [184], 'NEG'), ([179, 180], [343, 344], 'NEG'), ([347, 348], [184], 'NEG'), ([347, 348], [343, 344], 'NEG'), ([376], [155], 'NEG'), ([376], [378], 'NEG')]

My HP desktop died so I ordered a new Dell . While the idea of migrating was somewhat daunting , I decided to do it myself . The on-screen guidance is very easy to follow . You need each machine hooked up to a monitor as you need to go from one to the other during the migration process . I hooked up the Laplink cable and the process of migration began . It took about 7-8 hours to complete the transfer . Everything moved in working order EXCEPT Microsoft Office which is not PCMover 's fault as Windows 10 does not allow the migration of Office ( you now have to subscribe to Office 365 !) . Some of the directories are different but I was able to resolve it on my own .

Recently I upgraded my computer software to Windows 10 . After the upload I went to open my Cook’n software App but I receive an error message and the program would not open . I contacted the DVO support team and asked for help . The initial fix they sent me did n’t work so with all the recipes l had entered into the Cook’n App and all those I downloaded I was afraid I lost them for sure . Contacted DVO again and was able to download the entire App again and because the recipes were saved into the Cook’n App cloud I was able to get them all back . There are some recipe Apps out there but none compares to Cook’n software . It ’s easy to use and has a ton of features which make this the best recipe App on the market . Do you want a great food recipe App ? Then Cook’n is just what you need .

Bought this software roughly a year ago and paid $ 59.99 . From the get go with a clean install Windows 8.1 would have issues trying to read / index the Mac partition and Task Manager would show 100 % disk usage , slowing down the system. < br /> Upon upgrading to Windows 10 I discovered that MacDrive 9 is not supported and shortly after found that MediaFour had released a new version called MacDrive 10 and expected me to pay $ 30 to upgrade . This is a poor way to treat your customers , creating limited functionality and forcing customers to pay money to upgrade . This is just so you can use one feature in the app , writing to the Mac partition . The operating system was a free upgrade but you expect me to shell out an additional $ 30 just to use the software ? Basically it 's a trap and MediaFour is bullying customers into shelling out more money. < br />< br /> I contacted MediaFour and sent them my key and purchase date hoping I could at least get a discount . In short their response was &# 34 ; tough luck &# 34 ; .

The best racing game period ! I have been playing pc and ps3 racing games for years. < br />< br /> Pros :< br /> 1 . You race real people all the time . No stupid AI to deal with . The quality of racing in the higher series is top notch . Be ready to devote hours to practice , practice , practice till you get vaguely competitive. < br /> 2 . Good ladder mechanism to work your way up from MX-5 / Solstice < br /> 3 . Helpful forums - get set up info , help on improving driving < br /> 4 . Excellent simulation . Super accurate tracks . The game is not an arcade by any stretch of imagination. < br /> 5 . Great set of cars . You will find something you love to race . My favorite is a Ruf C Spec ( a copy of a Porsche 997 Cup car ) - this is an intoxicatingly difficult car to drive but ensnares you like no other. < br />< br /> Cons :< br /> 1 . Expensive . It 's not the $ 49 per year fee but the price of buying cars , tracks that makes it pricey. < br /> 2 . Limited number of cars . While I like the type of cars offered , if you come from virtually any console game or other pc game , you will feel cheated . No 500 + cars , no road cars , etc . Trust me you will get over it. < br /> 3 . Not an arcade like Need for Speed. < br /> 4 . Remember # 1 in the Pro section . Guess what it is a con too . In the lower classes like rookie and ( to a lesser extent ) D class , the drivers are homicidal maniacs . Do you your best to advance through these classes and get to safer waters ( C and above ).< br />< br /> If you liked GP Legends or GT legends you will love this .

Many new and cool features are introduced in Windows 10 but bugs and other problems such as no privacy , heavy ads appear too . You can disable ads and avoid open privacy but the mandatory updates will not allow users to do so in the future . This is a guess only . Windows is a service for profit so nothing will be free include new features . You might upgrade to Windows 10 from 7 or 8.1 for free now but someone has to pay for you either now or in the future. < br />< br /> Who will pay ? That 's all Windows 10 users and advertisers . With future updates users have to accept all changes include add new subscription services or remove current free features or pay to keep . Media center and a couple traditional Windows games already turned to be subscription service now so such changes can happen for other existed and new features too. < br />< br /> If you just want a start menu like Windows 7 , you can just use classic shell for free which works for all Windows 8 , 8.1 , 10 and do not have to pay $ 100 or more for this operating system . Go for Windows 10 only if you want to have longer security support than Windows 7 and 8.1 and have no problem with mandatory updates that may or may not damage your PC .#### #### ####[([185], [17], 'NEU'), ([185], [20], 'NEU'), ([185], [66], 'NEU'), ([185], [130], 'NEU'), ([185], [161], 'NEU'), ([18], [17], 'NEU'), ([18], [20], 'NEU'), ([21], [20], 'NEU'), ([67], [161], 'NEU')]

While I am not thrilled with the whole subscription thing , the product key worked just fine . I did what others suggested and set up a MS account and downloaded the free trial on a new laptop ( after uninstalling the Office version that came with it ) . I did have to enter credit card info , but nothing gets charged . Once that was up and running , I just went back into my MS account and entered the product key and it added 12 months to the free trial for a total of 13 months . Totally painless process. < br />< br /> I should note that I also had a school version of Office 365 installed on another laptop and you can not just switch the type of install . Since Microsoft removed the &# 34 ; save your settings &# 34 ; tool a few versions ago , I was not looking forward to setting up outlook again .

Fantastic program that does &# 34 ; nearly &# 34 ; everything you need to make importing recipes from the web and making them your own . Also provides really good cookbooks that be imported as they are or into your own on-line cookbooks . The graphical component is GREAT ! I love being able to easily add pictures to my recipes . I bought the program only 8 months ago and already have added over 4000 recipes into my own cookbooks / categories . That does n't include the recipes from the Cook'n cookbooks . The only complaint , and it is a minor one , is that I thought scanning recipes from my multiple cookbooks would be easier -- but the scanning is only easy if the formatting is in one column -- two columns or more recipes just do n't work -- and being a speedy typist it is easier to just type in the recipes . Once you figure out the short cuts built into the program -- you find even the typing is n't laborious . Best of all the technical support is some of the best I 've encountered . I 've never asked a question that I did n't get an immediate response for -- sometimes from multiple people . Also the forums and the newsletters really help to keep you informed and up to date . Finally , when I switched over to Windows 10 and my application &# 34 ; was n't happy &# 34 ; they had a &# 34 ; fix-it &# 34 ; up immediately -- and it worked . I tried other programs in the past ( on older PCs ) and I tried to create my own database of recipes . This program far outstrips anything I 've ever used . I have some computer skills which helps me use some of the advanced features -- but I am by no means a programmer .

So far so good . I found out when I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 that I could n't put Norton 360 on it . I chose to get the version that would work on 5 different computers . 360 was good for 3 computers . But this version is a pared down version that does n't have the backup feature that 360 did . The version that had it could have been put on 10 computers . No problems with the download occurred and all is going smoothly at this point . Anticipating problems I opted for the activation card be sent to me rather than the immediate download. < br />< br /> The one disappointment was it is stated that this would work on mobile devices . It does n't work with my iPad . It said it did n't work with iPads in the US . I 'll update if any problems with the product is noted .#### #### ####[([60, 61], [56, 57], 'NEU')]
Norton changes names and numbers so frequently it is hard to keep up with . I 've had 360 for a number of years and loved it ; however , they did away with it and Internet Security does n't seem to be as good .

12 is a real improvement over pse 8 .

I bought this so that I could upgrade my system to Microsoft 's free offering of Windows 10 . Installation was just like all the other systems I built . This did n't require any special hardware and installed right away . During installation , it asked me for the License Key . After the installation completed , I went to the System Properties to confirm that the license activated . Under &# 34 ; Windows activation &# 34 ; , it stated that the license was invalid and could not be activated . I suspected this might have been because there was no activate Internet connection yet . After re-entering the license a second time , my license activated without problems . Shortly thereafter , I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro without problems . Windows 10 itself had a few hiccups , which basically required me to reinstall some software , but that was about it . All is well .#### #### ####[([16, 17], [13], 'POS'), ([16, 17], [87], 'POS')]
This product has to be the most comprehensive and ambitious recipe software on the market and is only getting better . That said new software upgrades have brought with them some hiccups and those have taken time to resolve in my personal experience . I have seen some of the low ratings and I see they tend to be a year old or more , back when their last huge leap forward happened and bugs were discovered . For me it 's frustrating any time a product does n't work smoothly but I have yet to lose my recipes ( thank goodness for the free cloud backing up feature that automatically backs up across my four devices ) . Probably the best thing about the product is the technical support and follow up which has always been timely ( say within 1-2 business days ) and frankly it 's only getting better with each iteration and the input the company asks for from the customers . Is it perfect ? No. But I challenge you to find a more feature-packed recipe software out there . I looked and made the move to Cook'n 2 years back and even with the bumps it 's been amazing and for the most part fun to use .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [179], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [19], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [210], 'POS'), ([105, 106], [104], 'POS'), ([128, 129], [179], 'POS'), ([128, 129], [19], 'POS'), ([128, 129], [210], 'POS')]

Office 365 home is a fantastic service for my family of 5 . Each of us gets our own suite of Office apps , OneDrive storage ( 1TB each ) and 60 minutes of Skype Minutes .

The program is good , good , better , best , but is lacking in roll response , throttle response and explaination . I have a commercial rating and find that his explaination of some things is questionable . I have deliberatly done some things wrong and the session was cut short instead of Rob taking the controls and explaining and demonstrating the proper methods again . In flight instruction you do n't just say Ok you really messed that one up so we are going to land . Rob tries to be a comedian and fails miserably . I know it is a simulator but the time to joke is when you are on the ground and the airplane is secured .

Before you upgrade to Windows 10 or purchase , you should be aware of the changes to Microsoft 's privacy policy . Microsoft 's new privacy policy for Windows 10 : We will access , disclose and preserve personal data , including your content ( such as the content of your emails , other private communications or files in private folders ) , when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to protect our customers or enforce the terms governing the use of the services . It seems there is no choice in this matter , by nature of accepting their terms you are essentially agreeing that they have access to all your personal content , documents and files . This is my personal opinion , but somehow that does n't seem right . Since Windows 10 has been released it has become clear the lengths Microsoft takes to collect personal data from its customer base , in addition to taking advantage of their customers by building their data collection methods into their software and software setup process by not allowing the option to turn off some data collection features . This policy is invasive and well beyond the boundaries for collecting personal data .#### #### ####[([19, 20], [198], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], [201], 'NEG')]

I had a terrible experience with the tech support . It seems they are out of Singapore and use Iyogi to do the job . I was trying to transfer files , etc. from windows 7 to a new windows 10 computer . The tech took over my mouse and did a deep scan of Windows 7 and found 30 viruses . The only way I could get those off was to pay him a bunch of money to clean out Windows 7 and then do the transfer . I tried to pay by credit card and this I did n't like . The screen where you put your card number in remained blank after I applied the number . The tech even went to lengths to say he was turning around so he could not see the number . Well , my bank was on the ball and denied both transactions . This really sounded very suspicious to me and was afraid of identity theft . I bought a book from Amazon yesterday and the payment was denied . I also took both computers to a local computer outfit and they did the transfer in 4 hours . That payment was denied . My husband called our bank and they told him the people in Singapore tried to use my credit card again and the third time , the bank locked my card . Thank goodness ! And the computer place got paid and I have my book . But be forewarned about these tech supports from across the ocean . They are ruthless and I 'm very happy my bank shut my credit card down .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [3], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], [178], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], [264], 'NEG')]

I was a loyal Corel WordPerfect user ever since the previous millennium . I loved it . I refused to buy a Mac because it was n't Corel compatible . It was perfect for everything. < br />< br /> I recently converted to Scrivener ( Windows version ) in the past few years , initially for the epub / mobi output function , but also because it kicked up my productivity several notches . I still used WordPerfect for a few things , though , like brainstorming . But recently , for some reason WP has started giving me errors about not being able to initialize because of template corruption . This was on Windows 8 AND 7 , and within a day of using each machine . I tried all the standard solutions -- change the appdata / roaming profile , going into regedit , repairing install , and uninstalling / reinstalling . All completely useless . The only so-called solution was to right click on the main icon for WP and say &# 34 ; run as administrator. &# 34 ; No longer can you click on a document icon and expect it to open , you have to go to the program itself then navigate from there to whatever document you wanted to open in the first place . Yeah , not acceptable. < br />< br /> So , I 'm reluctantly abandoning WP . I 'm forced to accept that I will have to use some other program -- Libre Office , Open Office , whatever -- for all non-novel writing tasks . Ciao , baby . The good times were good while they lasted .#### #### ####[([259], [157], 'NEG')]

TERRIBLE piece of software . I 've been paying for mixcraft since version 4 , but honestly I do n't know why I bother supporting them . If I were you , I 'd just pirate this software . But even then , I 'd say you 'd be getting ripped off . It is n't anywhere close to pro-level . It does n't even have TRUE stereo output tracks ffs . A weak time stretching algorithm , and more random bugs than you 'll even want to try to work around . Using this software should merit the user a medal for actually putting up with all the headaches it causes . If you want to record some crappy , low-quality demos , mixcraft would be fine for you ; but at that point , just download Audacity for free . I 've delved very deep into mixcraft 's &# 34 ; producer-level &# 34 ; features and none of it gave me what I needed to do what would be relatively simple tasks in pro-tools or logic studio .

First let 's get the technical review out of the way . Regrettably , this security suite performs exceptionally well , and without slowing down your PC to anywhere near what products from competitors do ( Norton , BitDefender , in my personal experience ) . Why regrettably ? Well , unfortunately , I am one of those people that believe in integrity , honesty and forthrightness , with which the people at Threat Track seem to take issue . Ergo , their shameless promoting of a &# 34 ; lifetime &# 34 ; subscription , when it is NOT a lifetime subscription at all . Read the fine print , and understand that this &# 34 ; lifetime &# 34 ; refers only to the &# 34 ; lifetime &# 34 ; of the PC on which it was originally installed , so if you 're planning on replacing your PC , or upgrading it yourself in the next few years , do not spend money on a product that will be useless on your next piece of hardware . This is not my &# 34 ; interpretation &# 34 ; of the pitch , it is DIRECTLY from the people at Threat Track themselves . Jerk-offs . So that 's why I say regrettable , because I finally found a security suite that 's acceptable , and the company turns out to be run by A-Holes . Just my luck . I suppose I could submit to becoming a zombified human like most of those belonging to the species have become , and give them the money even though they suck , but I just can not bring myself to do it . If you just either purchased or built a new PC with the latest , greatest hardware , the &# 34 ; lifetime &# 34 ; product is a good value at $ 79 ( see below ) . If your PC is older , and nearing time for major upgrading or replacement - save your money. < br />< br /> Oh - BTW ... save yourself MUCH cash if you do decide to purchase any of their subscriptions by first checking out their website directly , which generally runs promotions , or other vendors , where the going price for the &# 34 ; lifetime &# 34 ; product is about $ 79 , as of August , 2015 .#### #### ####[([15, 16], [19], 'NEU'), ([15, 16], [226], 'NEU'), ([222, 223], [19], 'NEU'), ([222, 223], [226], 'NEU'), ([222, 223], [313], 'NEU'), ([300], [226], 'NEU'), ([300], [313], 'NEU')]

( Yes , that was sarcasm . ) It 's not Microsoft 's fault that the drivers are n't where they should be .

This item so far appears to be very good , but if you are not used to working with layers , masks and the sort , then this can take some getting used to . The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the constant lagging . If I had an old slow computer , then I could understand , but my computer is built for speed , and this is the only program which drags like this . The fact that it does a great job with pictures make it more than worth it though . Pros : Greatly enhances your pictures , many very useful tools for editing and manipulating photos , and for the price , you really ca n't complain ! Cons : Not much of a Con , but still needs to be put out there . There 's a bit of a learning curve depending on your experience , but do n't let that stop you from buying this program , many new photo editing programs have these type of features , but this program does an excellent job .

I Like Cook'n . I tried some of the other recipe management programs , but they all seem to have glitches or functionality that does n't meet my needs . I have been using Cook'n now for about 2 months . I really like their tools that support entering recipes by using the URL of the website that has the recipe , by scanning the recipe , and by capturing my clipboard on which I have copied the recipe . Of course , when none of those functions can be used , I use the age old method of keyboarding it in . Even the keyboarding process is made easier by using context-sensitive fields . Cook'n is n't without its glitches , but they seem much fewer than with other recipe software . And , Cook'n's technical support tries hard to be there for me .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [43], 'POS'), ([22], [20], 'POS'), ([22], [24, 25], 'POS'), ([22], [109], 'POS')]

The firewall / antivirus seems to be about on par with the previous 360 I had , which is quite good . I 've never been compromised and it has very little impact to the performance of my system so thumbs up there . I do n't use the backup option as 25 GB is n't nearly enough ( I use CrashPlan and store about 150 ) but for most users its probably plenty . The family controls both on Windows 7 and Android are terrible . Especially Android as you can only limit access to a few installed apps ( no pre installed like text messaging , etc ) and you ca n't control access to the system settings . I grabbed a free app off the Play Store ( Screen Time ) that does it worlds better . If I had bought the lower level version without backup and family controls I would give it 4 , maybe even 5 , stars , but given I wanted the family controls at the very least I ca n't give it more than 3 .#### #### ####[([35], [85], 'NEU'), ([76, 77], [85], 'NEU')]

BB25 ( especially the MAC version ) has somehow bombed as a good bridge-playing program ( unlike previous versions ) . Over the yrs , it has enjoyed top ratings with many recommendations from avid players and teachers . The negative reviews posted here are spot on . Customer service is almost non-existent . BB25 will give you bizarre opening leads and bizarre bidding ( which includes over-bidding without the required support or point count ) . Even its defensive play is not what it once was . For more advanced users , you 'll love hearing a Michaels 2-spade cue from your partner ( north ) when he / she has 4 HCP ! I have questioned the developers about 20 + distinct hands . Each one required a explanation for BB25 actions that were inexplicable . Ive received a few replies : One saying the developers dont have time for bridge lessons , and the other told me they were too busy to respond . The BB25 mess is perhaps due to a change in how long BB takes to &# 34 ; think &# 34 ; about a play , lead , or bid . It now takes very little time for all actions . No matter how you set your play / lead / bid options , bizarre things will happen with fair frequency . This perhaps wont make much difference to the beginner , but intermediate and advanced players might wonder why they paid for this software . In my view , a better more consistent bridge-playing experience can be obtained from Wbridge5 which is free and easy to use . I wont be a buyer of the next BB .#### #### ####[([13, 14], [58], 'NEG'), ([13, 14], [136], 'NEG'), ([13, 14], [272], 'NEG'), ([79, 80], [82], 'NEG'), ([79, 80], [136], 'NEG')]

I bought this program because I was using AVG Zen on my Samsung cell phone and it worked well . Also , AVG had good reviews and I liked that I could install it on an unlimited number of machines. < br /> However , the program has messed up three of my computers causing me hours of research and time . I still do n't have one laptop running correctly . On that laptop , there are error messages that it is missing windows files . Also , Word and Excel will not open along with other issues . This began immediately after installing AVG Ultimate which will not work properly because it wo n't accept the correct license number . . . but AVG wo n't uninstall either . There were no installation issues on this machine prior to installing AVG . I 'm hoping installing Windows 10 will replace the missing files . If that does n't work I 'm considering restoring the laptop to factory settings as the issues are too numerous to combat one by one. < br /> Another computer had issues immediately after installation also . After installing AVG Ultimate , the computer was missing some critical files to run Solid Works properly . SW was kind enough to send the missing files and it 's up and running again. < br /> Last Friday , a computer that had been working fine for several months with AVG Ultimate came up with issues after installing the newest version of Office . The Tuneup piece of AVG disabled the new Office program because it was using too much in resources . I could not open Word or Excel after that . I reinstalled an older version of Office which is working properly now . But I cannot uninstall the new Office program because it is &# 34 ; disabled. &# 34 ;< br /> I have uninstalled AVG Tuneup on all my computers as I think that is the piece of AVG Ultimate that is &# 34 ; cleaning up &# 34 ; necessary files and disabling needed programs . I will be replacing the virus protection piece also and discontinuing use of AVG Ultimate entirely. < br /> If I could give this program NO stars , I would . I seldom write reviews , but I am hoping to help others avoid the hassles I 've gone through . I will add that I did not call AVG tech support . Reviews of their support were not good so I did not contact them .#### #### ####[([84, 85], [83], 'NEG'), ([89], [263], 'NEG'), ([89], [424, 425], 'NEG'), ([148, 149], [83], 'NEG'), ([148, 149], [263], 'NEG'), ([148, 149], [359], 'NEG'), ([266, 267], [83], 'NEG'), ([266, 267], [263], 'NEG'), ([306, 307], [83], 'NEG'), ([306, 307], [263], 'NEG'), ([354], [83], 'NEG')]

When I was a young kid in the 90s , I remember my brother and I were terrified of this game - not really sure why , but our sister and mom were obsessed with it . I thought about it recently and had to buy it . I had a few compatibility issues ( my main computer 's OS is windows 7 home premium , 64-bit ) so despite researching endlessly on how to play it on my computer , I eventually realized that I could n't play it on my computer . However , after a while my mom let me borrow this ancient laptop that she has that has Windows Vista and it was compatible and I had no problems .

I really love my Cook'n program . It was a gift from my son several years ago and I have enjoyed it very much . It 's easy to use and the few times I 've needed support , the Cook'n team has come to my rescue . I watch a lot of cooking shows and Cook'n makes it so easy to search for and find the recipes I 'm interested in trying out and then storing it if it turns out to be one I want to keep . I also enjoy being able to create my own cookbook with recipes my family loves . Cook'n is a lot of fun for people who enjoy food and cooking and I highly recommend it .#### #### ####[([5], [2], 'POS'), ([5], [60], 'POS'), ([5], [122], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [60], 'POS'), ([29], [27], 'POS'), ([40, 41], [60], 'POS')]

This is fairly easy to use / install. < br />< br /> From what I recall ( it 's been many months since I first got this product ) , I just inserted the disc ( that it came with ) into a laptop and installed the program . I opened the program . I plugged in one of the USB-like cables ( that it came with ) into the laptop . Here 's what you should know : this product does NOT have the other important cable with the red white and yellow colors that plugs into your VCR and connects with the USB cable. < br />< br /> Luckily , my parents had that other cable already somewhere in the home. < br />< br /> Once it was all plugged in ( the laptop to the VCR ) , I just hit play and the program I had just installed began to show the VCR movie on the laptop . You just click a record button on your computer screen and it begins recording whatever is playing on the VCR. < br />< br /> The digital quality that is the result is not crystal clear HD , but it 's not terribly blurry either .#### #### ####[([5], [3], 'NEU'), ([48], [3], 'NEU')]

Pretty decent price for two programs . It seems to run slow on my laptop even though my laptop is a Intel i7 Quad Core processor . Premier element is a bit hard to navigate .

Photoshop Elements is definitely worth the price . It works well and is pretty easy to use . I has most of the features that I need. < br />< br /> As new versions come out this should get cheaper. < br />< br /> I watched this product for a long time because price would go up and down a lot .

Hands down one of the best Mac software I 've purchased for productivity . You can tell Parallels put a lot of thought behind this product .

I have been using NOD32 for several years and have found it to give the best balance of thorough protection without slowing down my system . I still check reviews and tests every so often , but so far NOD32 is still leading the pack ! I have it on several computers. < br />< br /> Another pro is that if you have an active license for the product , you can always upgrade to the newest version . So if you see an old version at a deep discount - GRAB IT ! You can download the latest version at ESET 's website and then use the old license to activate it. < br />< br /> One negative - their User ID & Password system is aggravatingly complicated .

Beware of this software . First , I am not technologically-challenged , but I am not an IT person either . That said , I have transfered one computer to another many times . Because I normally manually transfer my files and reinstall my software , I thought I was saving myself a headache and some hassle by purchasing PCMover . I read the user guide . I went through the preparation steps and chose to transfer over local wifi . As soon as I initiated the process , the software informed me that it would take 36 hours to complete . Gulp . Okay , not ideal , but it was the weekend , so I went for it . Well , 36 hours turned to 42 hours and 50 minutes with no end in sight . I finally called the free assistance number . Between the language barrier and the technician 's insistence that the problem was likely on my end ( He told me that I should have called the number BEFORE I got started . Nowhere is this stated . He told me that this process was like a brain transplant and that any issues I may have had with my old computer 's registry would get transferred to my new computer . I did not see any such warnings in the instruction manual . I would not have taken that chance regardless of known or unknown issues . He also told me I could wait another few hours , wait for the process to fail or have him stop the transfer so I start the process over. ) . I wish I had never purchased this software . What a nightmare .#### #### ####[([3], [0], 'NEG'), ([3], [285], 'NEG')]
Alright so my windows computer would not boot at all ! ! It got stuck at the HP screen and I found no solution online. . So I contacted Microsoft and they told me to get a Windows 7 recovery disk. . So after I hung up I looked on Amazon for one and I found this. . It was cheap so I got it and shipping was fast and recovery / reinstall was very easy . They send you instructions to boot up into the DVD. . Re installing windows 7 was fast it took maybe about an half an hour to 45 mins . Right now im writing this review on the computer and It works as if I just turned it on for the first time. . But make sure you have your windows 7 product key ! ! If not this disk would be useless. .

This product my be out on the market but as a PC gamer I would not recommend this product just yet as it seems Microsoft as not work out all the bugs in the system , so expect a windows 10.1 update for this product as it seems it is still kinda in beta it feels like. < br /> Sure when I installed it the installation was easy and my computer ran faster than it would on windows 8.1 , but when I go the play games from my system account expect your computer to crash and or not want to load windows back up without having to reinstall the OS system process again ! However that said it is good for browsing the web or streaming video like YouTube . I have not tried any apps like Hulu or Netflix yet because my computer has done just as my description says and i will have to reinstall the OS . So a word of advice if you get the product expect some little to major glitches from windows programs and do not download any software that may cause your OS system to crash .#### #### ####[([66], [68], 'NEU'), ([123], [121], 'NEU'), ([123], [73], 'NEU')]

I bought this for a family friends granddaughter to help her with her spelling as that is one of the subjects she struggles with . She loves to play this game all the time . You can have one to four players play at a time but normally it is just her so she has to play with the computer a lot . Which can be hard for her because since she is not that good at spelling yet it makes it look like the computer is winning all the time . I will admit that some of the games are a bit challenging for someone younger to play but the more you play them the easier they do become . I can see this game helping her with her spelling and such greatly as more she plays with it < br />< br /> I received this product at a free or discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review .#### #### ####[([99], [22], 'POS'), ([99], [103], 'POS'), ([99], [116], 'POS'), ([13], [22], 'POS'), ([13], [103], 'POS'), ([13], [116], 'POS')]

Cant believe this lousy company. . Got the 30 day version and it worked like a charm but NOT the software I bought .

The fiasco everyone was never fully mended . As I try to finish my extended tax return , I was told to upgrade it to Home & Business Edition ($ 10 more ) if I want to enter another business . This was a standard feature in Deluxe edition until this year . After many bad reviews , I convinced myself to stay with TurboTax as the company finally , it seemed , tried to make it right . I am so tired of being ripped off . It is too late to switch at this point , but I am DEFINITELY going with another company next year . Very disappointed .#### #### ####[([45], [110], 'NEG')]

FTM 2014 is much more complicated than previous versions . I have been using this program for 10-15 years but 2014 has so many problems . I have tried unsuccessfully to write a book in FTM 2014 .

Do you like to purchase a software product and have it crash constantly , and work extremely slow the few times it actually works ? This program is for you then ! I have an i7-4770K with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit , 16GB of RAM , an SSD system drive , conventional HDD for massive storage and a decent video card even by today 's standards ( eVGA GTX 460 ) . This machine is basically a beast that laughs at most anything thrown at it . But PowerDirector seems specially engineered to utilize resources in the most inefficient and disastrous ways possible . 90 +% of my raw footage is not even full HD just 720p from action cameras . PowerDirector struggles to churn through minutes of footage and predictably crashes multiple times during the simplest of editing tasks . I do not have issues with any other application on this machine and I run some pretty demanding scientific stuff : Oracle VM VirtualBox with Ubuntu and Windows 10 tech preview ( before it was released ) , PTC Creo Elements 3.0 , Folding @ Home , Blender 3D , COMSOL and ANSYS v11 ( both FEA programs ) , and generally all sorts of video transcoding applications like MakeMKV , and Handbrake . I can run FEA solutions for hours solving for well over 50,000 degrees of freedom , or render ( ray trace ) complex scenes in Blender without any hiccups so I know the issue is not with my computer . PowerDirector will crash half a dozen times before I can finish editing a 5-10 minute video clip . Simply stated : it is garbage . Pros : - Came in a pretty box . - Managed to produce a few projects by religiously saving every 5 seconds and eventually giving up on features that cause it to not render the project . - Actually comes with a decent set of codecs for a variety of video formats . - Can handle high speed footage and the resulting slow motion video is cool ( if you can manage to get to a finished product that is ) . Cons : - Crashing , freezing , hanging , being stuck in an infinite processing loop ( this is so often that one starts to believe it 's the main function of this program ) - Redraw : OMG !! ! How can a piece of software not even properly redraw its own window elements in the year 2015 ???? ? This is coding 101 people ! - Clumsy interface , often not intuitive . - Nagging you to spend more money by upgrading ( LOL sure let me get right on that ! ) - It will make you want to destroy your computer with a baseball bat#### #### ####[([48], [98], 'NEG'), ([48], [122], 'NEG'), ([48], [131], 'NEG'), ([48], [257], 'NEG'), ([48], [322], 'NEG'), ([37, 38], [122], 'NEG'), ([37, 38], [322], 'NEG'), ([59, 60], [58], 'NEG'), ([88], [98], 'NEG'), ([88], [122], 'NEG'), ([88], [257], 'NEG'), ([88], [430], 'NEG'), ([88], [434, 435], 'NEG'), ([121], [98], 'NEG'), ([121], [100], 'NEG'), ([121], [122], 'NEG'), ([121], [131], 'NEG'), ([121], [257], 'NEG'), ([121], [322], 'NEG'), ([121], [434, 435], 'NEG'), ([255], [98], 'NEG'), ([255], [100], 'NEG'), ([255], [122], 'NEG'), ([255], [131], 'NEG'), ([255], [257], 'NEG'), ([255], [430], 'NEG'), ([255], [434, 435], 'NEG'), ([431], [98], 'NEG'), ([431], [122], 'NEG'), ([431], [430], 'NEG'), ([431], [434, 435], 'NEG')]

Wow ,< br /> We needed this for a new windows 10 machine. < br />< br /> This came up as recommended and easy to use . We bought this mostly for Thank You and various Quarter Fold Cards. < br /> Well , first , ALL of their DEFAULT cards are 1 / 2 fold , and require DUPLEX printing in the stupidest way ( I have a duplex laser printer ).< br />< br /> Next , selecting the proper &# 34 ; Quarter Fold Horizontal Top &# 34 ; took about 10 tries . Their blank templates give you NO indications as to which way things are going to fold. < br />< br /> Then , the default margins are huge . 0.600in for the 4 sides of the paper . And then almost 1.00in between columns . And this is the default setting . It looked cheap . It then took me 15 minutes to FIND where I change this ( Tools -&# 62 ; Dimensions ) . And I spent another 15 minutes tweaking the numbers and printing to find the right margins to match our expectations. < br />< br /> Many of the graphics only look good on 1 / 2 page size pages . They look smashed on 1 / 4 fold. < br />< br /> The graphics collection is way better than the 10 year old software we were using . But the ease of use is questionable . My daughter could create a card in the old software when she was about 7-8 . The backgrounds are really decent , and lots of new borders. < br />< br /> But it was not easy to get it configured the way we want it . Now that it is , it should be easy enough. < br /> Oh , the program CRASHES on startup , because I used the &# 34 ; Save Settings as Default &# 34 ; on the Dimensions page . I ca n't get it to go away. < br /> We hit ignore , and it starts / works okay. < br />< br /> Finally , I went to the companies web site . And they CHARGE for support . Wow !< br />< br /> Good Luck#### #### ####[([26], [24], 'NEG'), ([123], [125], 'NEG'), ([123], [249], 'NEG'), ([123], [271], 'NEG'), ([123], [315], 'NEG'), ([228], [24], 'NEG'), ([228], [232], 'NEG'), ([247], [249], 'NEG'), ([247], [271], 'NEG')]

There is honestly so much that I can say about anti-virus software . They have honestly became much more of a essential entity whenever you have to get a computer , Mac or Windows . But finding the right anti-virus scan can actually be more of a challenge . Unfortunately many people have chosen to go to brands like Norton or McAfee to do whatever they can do to definitely protect their computer . But out of a lot of brand names , there are better ones out of the box , like BitDefender . It has been more of a surprise trying to get rid of all those cookies and spyware from invading your laptop , without a lot of problems . It really does a much more thorough job at getting through your hard drive and looking through those nooks and crannies and getting into your hard drives , external and internal and getting rid of the harassing malware . It really does a much better job at keeping the pesky phishing scams out of the PC . I truly have enjoyed this software a lot , and definitely worth the effort . I sincerely recommend that you get this anti-virus software a whole lot . BitDefender is definitely more of a great buy. < br />< br /> Price : B +< br />< br /> Convience : B -< br />< br /> Overall : B +#### #### ####[([11], [47], 'POS'), ([11], [129], 'POS'), ([11], [231], 'POS'), ([149], [47], 'POS'), ([149], [129], 'POS'), ([149], [231], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [47], 'POS'), ([221], [183], 'POS')]
We started using Cook'n years ago when it was version 5 , and we absolutely love it ! We make weekly menus from thousands of recipes and dozens of cookbooks , which makes planning and shopping so much easier . We get variety , can choose healthy options , and have simplified our lives greatly . It 's easy to add new recipes we find online by either using Capture ( which almost feels like a video game ) or using Snip-It to map the info into the right sections . By adding all of our family recipes by just scanning the old recipe cards , we have everything in one place that we can even access from our Mobile devices thanks to the Cloud ( so we can share any recipe with friends and family ) . Best of all , when our computer completely fried , DVO identified that we were existing customers and sent us a new download free of charge so we could easily reinstall on our new computer . Since we had the Cloud organizer , all of our recipes , images , menus , themes , etc. , imported right back in like nothing ever happened . It took no more than 5 minutes to have full recovery .

This products is a key card literally with your product key on a little card in the package. . On the back of the package it gives you instructions on how to get your Windows 8 Pro on your computer . If you follow the directions exactly you should not have any issues . One thing to note , for whatever reason , when you 're preparing to install Windows 8 Pro , make sure you uninstall your language packs from your computer . If not , the installer may or may not get stuck . I was running an unactivated version of Windows 8.1 pro previously and to apply this key , i had to ' downgrade to upgrade ' for say . Once you get your windows installed and everything , to upgrade to 8.1 you 'll have to update your computer first then get it from the app store .

Please , DO NOT install this horrible operating system on your computer. < br />< br /> After &# 34 ; upgrading &# 34 ; from Windows 7 , I encountered numerous issues . None of my monitors above 1080p resolution worked without causing system-wide instability . I had many graphics issues including problems with all of my CAD software . The new start menu is god awful , unhelpful , a waste of space , and cortana is buggy , laggy , and slow . It also searches the web every time I want to search my computer. < br />< br /> This is just the beginning . Every time I shut down from Windows 10 , my computer would freeze on boot up the next time I turned it on . Every time . I would have to turn it off and on again to get it to boot . And keep in mind I am using a brand new top of the line custom built desktop PC and have had zero issues with Windows 7. < br />< br /> I reverted back to Windows 7 after installing this pathetic piece of snooping , spying , glitchy , work in progress software , but it did n't stop there . No , my whole system is screwed up now. < br />< br /> I never had a problem with anything on my computer until the Windows 10 install , and an unfortunate thing has happened since reverting back to Windows 7 . Not all of my hard drives ( yes including the one with the damn operating system on it ) are detected at boot every time , and half the time I go straight to BIOS. < br />< br /> I know 8 programming languages , I work with software all the time , and I VERY HIGHLY DO NOT recommend this software . Buy a copy of Windows 7 while you still can .#### #### ####[([218], [6], 'NEG'), ([218], [67], 'NEG'), ([218], [69], 'NEG'), ([218], [220, 221], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], [6], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], [220, 221], 'NEG'), ([58, 59], [53], 'NEG'), ([58, 59], [79], 'NEG'), ([58, 59], [81], 'NEG'), ([58, 59], [84], 'NEG')]

I have owned pc matic for going on five years and am totally pleased with it. < br />< br /> It started when my &# 34 ; homevista &# 34 ; edition grew balky , froze continually , would freeze any time I tried to download even so much as a you tube video , so I had to consider purchasing a new laptop for several hundred bucks or try pcmatic which had been showing their kitschy ads . For a few bucks I paid for their download and after a looong scanning my old vista began working smoothly , and to this day I use it as my backup . I scheduled a full scan once a week It downloads videos without a hitch , starts up loads in a reasonable time and continues to run better AFTER I purchased pcmatic than the thing ran when I bought it many years ago . Saved a bundle by delaying purchase of a newer laptop. < br />< br /> I have suffered not a single problem the one starrers report so I am not seeing what their objection is . There may indeed be better services out there , but I have communicated with them a couple of times via their messenging and have received responses within the two days promised which I find reasonable . I recommend anyone buy a one year subscription to give it a try since the cost is reasonable , which is what I did . If you do not like it , do n't renew , simple as that . Some of the complaints I read seem to be due to those downloading the &# 34 ; free &# 34 ; scan and then being surprised that the company sends you messages to buy their stuff . As a subscriber all I ever get is the report e-mailed to me after every scan .#### #### ####[([28], [34], 'POS'), ([28], [99], 'POS'), ([28], [244], 'POS')]

PhotoPlus X7 tries so hard to be a Photoshop clone but the technologies in Photoplus X7 are not equal or comparable to the ones in Photoshop or any big photo editing software product out there .

The highlight and shadow recovery is so badly implemented , it is useles. < br />< br /> With a major discount you could try it out .

PC mover did not work for me the first time I tried even though it showed it had after about 24 hours .

Beware ... this company offers very little in the way of support . I purchased Levels 1 , 2 , 3 , and Spanish Conversation . My most recent purchase was a year ago . Since that time , the company has updated the software and changed the software installation keys . As a result , all software purchased before the update is in the company 's eyes invalid and they will refuse requests for new keys telling you that you must re-purchase the software . If you never have to reinstall the software , you should be fine , but if you purchase a new computer ( as I did ) and then try to reinstall your software , your installation key will fail . This is , in my estimation , a very dishonest practice . Be aware that this company , will refuse to re-validate your software .

I have been editing videos for over 20 years . I had been using Premier Pro for awhile but then started using Pinnacle 12 and preferred it over Premier for its ease of use and user friendly , intuitive platform . I then purchased Pinnacle 14 and was still somewhat satisfied for awhile until it stopped being reliable . I 'm not sure why it wo n't burn DVDs correctly now while other software does so with ease . So I decided to upgrade to Pinnacle 18 Ultimate . I ca n't tell you how much I hate this product . Nothing is simple . It is now taking me at least four times as long to edit a video than it did using Pinnacle 14 . The main reason is due to the arrangement of tools and need for &# 34 ; importing &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; exporting &# 34 ; and other unnecessary steps to accomplish anything . Nothing is user friendly or intuitive . I cannot believe the reviewers that say it is easy . The professional reviewers mention how difficult it has become . One mentioned that it took him a month of intense training before being able to use it effectively . The learning curve is frustrating . No ... infuriating ! I do n't have the hours it takes to learn what should be an intuitive task . My latest frustration ( among dozens ) has been trying to figure out how to make titles . Why did they make it so hard to do the simplest tasks ? I do n't have enough room here to mention all the problems I have encountered . The only plus side of this product is the higher quality videos it produces . For whatever reason , Pinnacle 14 using mpeg2 never looked decent . I am going to try and find a product similar to their earlier software . I do n't know when they made these major changes but I am hoping enough complaints come in that the software engineers will improve the ease of operation . I 'm thinking of trying out the Wondershare editor , Filmora , which is said to be much easier and intuitive for the majority of edit jobs .#### #### ####[([33], [31], 'NEG'), ([39], [38], 'NEG')]

DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE without understanding that you only get ~ 150 free prints ... after that you must purchase additional printing permissions . If you do n't purchase the permissions , it will print &# 34 ; VOID &# 34 ; on the check stock making it useless . This is a huge rip-off . I had an older version of this software and it did n't have any such charge . So you pay for the software and then after using it to print a modest number of checks it hits you with this additional charge .

I bought a brand new pc and decided to go with Windows 7 on that machine because I have Windows 8 on my laptop ... nuff said . The fact that you can STILL buy a brandnew machine running Windows 7 says all there is to say about Windows 8 . Of course a short time later Windows 10 was announced with a free upgrade but I 'm not sure I 'm biting after having suffered Microsofts last disaster ... may just stick with 7. < br />< br /> Which leads me to this product ; I got Word 2012 for my laptop and hated it almost as much as I did Windows 8 ! They 've tried to offer more and more functions and features , things that most people will never need or use and in doing so they 've made the program so cumbersome and annoying to use that it just drove me nuts . When you need a two page laminated cheat sheet to use Word something has gone horribly wrong . So , went with Word 2010 and I love it. < br />< br /> I did have issues with downloading it from the Microsoft site though , because it 's old software you have to really search for the link , the one provided with the package no longer works so do n't even bother . And even once I found the rigth link it was a chore , it refused to download correctly until I finally had to call Microsofts helpdesk for assistance . Twice actually because the first call connected me with a woman in India who was very nice but had a very heavy accent , that and the terrible connection ( it is a few continents away after all ) made it impossible for us to have a conversation . I understand the Microsoft pretty much has a monopoly here but when are they going to stop subjecting their customers to this type of nonense . Was n't inflicting Windows 8 on us enough ??< br />< br /> So after it being much harder than it should have been or could have been I got the softward downloaded . Does anyone remember the good old days before code keys when the software actually came on a CD ? I know , I sound like a dinosaur but you have to admit , it was a lot easier , and no calls to Mumbai !< br />< br /> Inclosing , love Word 2010 , not all that fond of the company that produced it .#### #### ####[([145], [147], 'POS'), ([145], [149], 'POS'), ([145], [409], 'POS')]

I was fearful of this new OS since they are bringing back the start button . I personally like 8.1 since I got used to the metro . Now that they took the damn chimes away in 10 I do n't what to do when I hover to the top right corner. < br />< br /> Since my desktop is not ready for 10 ( It can handle it but to reload everything takes days ) I decided to install on my Sony laptop with a new SSD drive . It installed in less than 20 minutes as expected ( 7 and 8 have the same time to install ) and the installation is standard protocol ( If you know vista 's installation , then this is a no brainier ) . Right off the bad Im greeted with this new windows wallpaper which looks completely custom . Like MS took it from deviant art . The login screen is STRAIGHT from Linux . Fedora and Ubuntu users know what I might be talking about . I swear to god the user interface is the worst Ive seen in my 20 + years of using Windows . They hid the key components . It took me 30 minutes to find the damn control panel . They made it like its for first time users who are coming from an apple device or new PC users . THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO. < br />< br /> When it comes to stability , its fine . It wont crash since its based of 7 and what not . The kernel is good and secure . What I do n't like is when your installing drivers that the first initial boxes will go but the rest of the installation will disappear as its installing the rest in the background . Especially sound and network drivers. < br />< br /> There is a lot more to complain about this OS . I do n't like it at the moment but as technology moves I will have to force myself to get used to this one and future computers that I will work on and built will have Windows 10 by default . For that reason , to keep up with the times .#### #### ####[([182, 183], [186], 'NEU'), ([182, 183], [273], 'NEU')]

Malwarebytes was a very good program . However , it recently changed from a lifetime subscription to an annual subscription per operating system on your computer . So if you run 3 computers , it will cost you $ 75 per year , If you run multiple operating systems on one computer ( like WIN 7 , WIN 81 and WIN 10 ) it will cost you $ 75 for one computer . I 'd look for other software as this product is now too costly for me .#### #### ####[([5], [4], 'NEG'), ([5], [85], 'NEG'), ([0], [4], 'NEG'), ([0], [85], 'NEG')]
Older iteration of Adobe Illustrator but still great ! I currently run Mac CS2 version of Illustrator , but have learned , used and continue to work with this great program . Other reviews which lament that this does n't have newer features is dead wrong . It imports bit-mapped images from photoshop and other programs like Streamline just fine . This is from 1995 with was 20 years ago , so anybody expecting it to compete with current versions is simply a misinformed and disabled user . LEARN how to use it .

For ease of install , this gets a zero . I purchased 4 laptops for my kids . Each had a 1 month trial of LiveSafe on it . You are not able to just enter the code and extend the subscription .

I used the DVD to upgrade my Lenovo X61s laptop from XP to Win7 . It worked perfectly , although it was quite a long process . It is an OEM disk and so I had to go online and grab the Lenovo drivers and install them as well . Once done , I ran my laptop with Win7 for about 2 weeks , then grabbed the FREE UPGRADE to Win10 that Microsoft gives FREE to all Win7 licensed users . That upgrade was very easy and automatic . Took a few hours but the system did all the work . This ended up being a great path from WinXP all the way to Win10 ( which is great so far after about a week ) .#### #### ####[([95], [17], 'POS')]

I purchased this through Sweetwater Sound a few years ago . I also purchased an ILOK in order to use it . I used this program along with a Yamaha CP300 stage piano and a Steinberg U22 . Well , after using this for a few months , I found that it did n't sound as good as the original CP300 piano ( at least not to me ) . Of course , the comparison of this product along with internal piano sounds and other products is highly subjective . However , I just was not able to determine that this product 's piano sounds were better and I was somewhat disappointed . I gave it two stars for effort but that 's about it . Update ... I changed the computer system to a much faster processor and solid state drive . In addition , I changed the speakers and amplifier .

While I used to use Security Essentials and Windows Defender on my systems , I 've been disappointed with the performance of these complementary solutions both in my first hand experience and in third party tests . I 've used Norton and McAfee enough over the years to never want to use them again ( have n't used either recently , so it 's more a long standing bias than a current comparison ) . Having seen ESET perform well in reviews / tests , I decided to give it a go . The software installs quickly , though the disc is just an active link to the current version online . It seems odd , but you really need to use a current AV version anyway . Worry not if you like me lack a CD / DVD / Blu Ray drive , as simply downloading the software works fine . The software packaging has a certificate with the actual activation code for the license . If you 're buying a version that supports multiple systems , your ID you create after the first system will allow subsequent activations. < br />< br /> Once you get ESET NOD32 up and running , it 's pretty straightforward . The app is visible in the taskbar , and it also makes appearances when you make the very frequent ( seems like 2-3 + times a day ) updates . It will also alert you to yet to be installed high risk security updates from Microsoft. < br /> In general , those are all expected by me , and otherwise you do n't know it 's there . The installation does n't consume too much ram , and it has yet to yield and false positives or let any malware by ( I 've used it for 5 months ) . This is not a comprehensive solution , so you 'll want to use a firewall and perhaps a malware scanner such as malware bytes ( I would n't say that 's necessary , but the Windows firewall or another is essential ) . Speaking of the Windows Firewall , it works well with this , as does the security control panel app , and Windows Defender . Windows Defender can remain installed and active with ESET NOD32 ( other AV apps probably should be removed before installing this ) . Speaking of installing this , it will not install on Windows Server 2012 R2. < br />< br /> Full disclosure , my employer gives me a free copy of the software , though I 've also purchased licenses for three more systems.will not install on Windows Server 2012 R2. < br />< br /> Full disclosure , my employer gives me a free copy of the software , though I 've also purchased licenses for three more systems .#### #### ####[([20], [17], 'POS'), ([20], [96], 'POS'), ([20], [150], 'POS'), ([20], [362], 'POS'), ([20], [428], 'POS'), ([357, 358], [96], 'POS'), ([357, 358], [362], 'POS'), ([369, 370], [17], 'POS'), ([369, 370], [150], 'POS'), ([369, 370], [362], 'POS'), ([375, 376], [17], 'POS'), ([375, 376], [150], 'POS'), ([375, 376], [362], 'POS')]

The picture for this product is when it was first released and sold in retail stores . I 've bought 3 of these from this seller and am very pleased with the results . These are genuine Microsoft , not copies or fakes . They arrive in a 2-disk cardboard sleeve with COA and Product Key on the back , with the Professional disk and the Business Contact Manager disk inside . The double sleeve is inside a slightly larger sealed , white cardboard mailer . Each time the product arrived in either a well packed box or padded envelope . I 've never had a problem activating or using these because they are the real deal , just an older version of Office. < br />< br /> I bought the first set because I bought a new laptop and my old set of disks bought when the product first came out would n't install without a new activation key and Microsoft ( M $) wanted more money ( about $ 99 five years ago ) . While M $ no longer supports 2003 , I already had an SP3 disk for updates for this product that I made a few years ago . http :// www.microsoft.com / en-us / download / details.aspx ? id = 8 ( Note : Read everything because M $ checks some boxes for stuff you may already have or do n't need , then move on to the download -- burn a copy if you can to a DVD or flash drive for future use if you need to reinstall it. )< br />< br /> FYI , Outlook 2003 and Comcast ( Xfinity ) do n't seem to play well together . It did until Comcast made a server change about 3 years ago , so if you run into a problem where it wo n't download emails , etc. , it 's not you -- it 's Comcast . Search for Outlook error 0x80040FC . Some people turned off the IPV6 and others used 76.96.26.11 in place of mail.comcast.net . http :// forums.xfinity.com / t5 / E-Mail-and-Xfinity-Connect-Help / Outlook-2003-Receiving-Mail-Problem-fixed / td-p / 1305763 < br />< br /> For the above , changing the mail.comcast.net to 76.96.26.11 worked for me for awhile then it started stalling . The problem still seems to be Comcast . So if this fix does n't work for you , google the error code abovefor more answers . It 's not you . It 's &# 34 ; them. &# 34 ;< br />< br /> Eventually , I bought a genuine copy of Office 2007 and 2010 because many businesses , public and private , are running either 2007 or 2010 although there are some still running 2003 . To remain marketable ( employable ) , I wanted to learn both the old and new systems in addition to using WordPerfect , Open Office , and Libre Office suites . Because my hard drives are large and dedicated to my work * , I have them all installed on my laptop and desktop with no problems . My advice on that issue is to install 2003 first even if you have to uninstall 2007 or later versions to do so , then install the later versions but do not install the later ones as an upgrade because you will lose the prior version . For example , I only have Access 2003 . If I had installed 2007 , which did n't include Access in the version I bought , as an upgrade , it would 've wiped out Access 2003 . (* Writing , art , and photography software tend to make games run slower . :-))< br />< br /> BTW , my husband uses 2013 on his private computer but his office just upgraded from 2007 to 2010 . It all depends upon what someone or a business ( large or small ) can afford . M $ Office 2003 is affordable if you want to start using M $ Office or if you want to upgrade from Office 2000 , which I had been using before I upgraded to Windows 7 . FYI , Windows 7 and Outlook 2000 did n't like each other much but the rest of 2000 did work with 7 . According to the late Gilda Radner character Rosanna Danna , &# 34 ; It 's always sumpthin '.&# 34 ;#### #### ####[([487, 488], [620], 'POS')]

This is a great program for recipes ! My mom had dozens of cookbooks with post-its and bookmarks of the recipes she liked and used . In order to find the one she wanted , she had to first find the right book , then flip through the myriad tabs to find the recipe she wanted . As she got older it was more and more difficult to find exactly what she wanted . We got this program so she could take the selections she liked and put them in an easy to search , easy to read format . After a brief tutorial , mom was able to start entering her recipes. < br /> Mom has passed , but we are able to easily find her favorite recipes , which were also ours , and make them for our families. < br /> I like that it has an easy feature to export to Word so I can share the recipes with my siblings. < br /> I would like to see a different way to format the print .

Saved the day when I lost a full CF card of photos ! Still in shock that I recovered the pictures . There are , admittedly , a few steps to take , especially if you 're dealing with a failing drive . It 's also a good idea to have a spare blank external drive handy in case you need to create a clone . But overall , it 's pretty straight forward , and if you have a little patience , it 's amazing. < br />< br /> Full story . I had just spent a day shooting head shots and group photos on a brand new CF card . When I tried to upload , the system froze , and I had to force quit . Upon restart card was blank ; everything was lost . I purchased and downloaded Data Rescue 4 for Mac . The install was simple : they email you a serial number , and you download the app and paste in the serial number to activate . ( Just be sure to drag the app into your app folder when you install . Initially , I was able to run it without having done so , and then I could n't find the application after quitting and trying to restart . It was a little confusing during a time when I was already pretty stressed. )< br />< br /> The software was fairly easy to use . It identifies the drives attached to your computer , and you choose the one you want to recover . You 're asked if you want to do a quick scan , deep scan , deleted files scan or clone . I tried quick scan , and it said because my CF card was n't Mac formatted , I needed to do a deep scan . I tried that , and received a warning that the transfer was too slow , and that the media was probably failing , and was encouraged to stop the recovery process and clone the card in case it failed completely. < br />< br /> I had an old external drive that I was n't using , so I reformatted that in Disk Utility . The software asked me which drive to use as my target for the clone , and I selected the newly formatted drive . Due to the bad card , the process was running so slow that it took all night . In the morning , it was 99 percent done , but it did n't appear to be able to finish the clone , so I stopped it. < br />< br /> At this point I was pretty frustrated . I tried to scan CF card again , but the card was complete toast , as I had been warned might happen . So , out of desperation , I ran a Deep Scan on the clone drive that I had cancelled at 99 percent . Unfortunately , I used a 2TB drive as the clone for my 64GB CF card , and the scan of the clone was going to take hours . But Data Rescue lets you stop a scan and still review the files that have already been found . After a couple hundred GB were processed , I stopped the scan just to see if I 'd gotten lucky. < br />< br /> At first , I did n't fully understand file structure . But when I performed a search for . jpg extensions in the recovered files , I was shocked to find all of my jpg and raw files in a folder entitled &# 34 ; Images. &# 34 ; The software had successfully cloned the bad CF card , and then had reconstructed the files from the clone .

This is overall a great Photoshop product . I am a beginner and found this very easy to use . It had three options that allowed you to choose from varying levels of difficulty which I liked . For basic fixes I was able to use the &# 34 ; easy &# 34 ; mode and when i needed to do more editing I could change the setting . I used this when editing photos for a photo quilt and I was able to do much more than I could with any other Photoshop software .#### #### ####[([5], [16], 'POS'), ([18], [16], 'POS')]

Many people unfairly say not to install Windows 10 , but I say this , try it for yourself if you do n't like it then use your own judgment , but do n't follow bias reviews , experience it and then make your own conclusion . I personally think Windows 10 is very good . If you do n't update your drivers some components might not work , sound video for instance . Make sure to check with your computer manufacturer , DELL HP , if they were late in releasing the drivers then its their fault not Microsoft .#### #### ####[([70], [54], 'POS'), ([70], [66, 67], 'POS'), ([7, 8], [54], 'POS'), ([50, 51], [54], 'POS'), ([64], [66, 67], 'POS'), ([69, 70], [66, 67], 'POS')]

This version of Microsoft Office is the most advanced technology I have seen in all versions of MS Office in the last 20 years . The technology brings a whole new meaning to MS Office , with its high tech and virtual graphics . As well as the desktop , this version allows you to use MS Office on line and save your documents in the cloud . Also , whilst on line and in MS Word for example , you can send someone a link via email and you can both share the same page . You can still also save your document to an earlier version of MS Word , just in case your recipient has n't got an up to date version of Word like you have. < br />< br /> It has amazing technology and well worth investing your money into . You wont be disappointed .#### #### ####[([9], [8], 'POS'), ([9], [137], 'POS'), ([42], [8], 'POS'), ([42], [41], 'POS')]

A thousand other people will review Windows 10 in great depth here , so I wo n't . I liked both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 , and I like Windows 10 even better . I think it 's a very logical and incremental improvement for Windows . It 's sleek , polished , fast , and easy to use . As an added bonus , I 've found that it 's also lighter weight , as far as system resource usage goes .

This game is working well for my ADHD daughter who deos n't like to get beat at games . We started out on a low level , giving her confidence . As she goes up in levels , the questions have gotten harder and she has to really work at getting the answers right so she can win .

I 've used Quickbooks for several years now . Intuit has to be the most dishonest company in the world . Their tactics are dirty and their customer support is the worst I 've ever had .

It took me several days and and many . many hours trying to get this resolved also . The software runs slow , even though I have a very fast machine .

Just getting around to reviewing Windows 7 . I now have Windows 10 installed on my Dell XPS400 via the massive update that occurred after 7-29-15 . But I still use Win7 on my laptop ( IBM Thinkpad G41 - 2GigRAM ) and would go back to my Win7 on my Dell XPS 400 at a drop of a pin if Windows 10 fails to deliver ( so far so good ) . Anyway , back to Win7 . Best windows version ever . I ca n't believe I waited so long to install Win7 from XP . I originally went from XP to Win7 because I was tired of the re-install process of placing XP on a new drive and loading all the service packs and updates that followed an install of XP . It sucked . But Win7 , bit newer , 1 service pack , some updates . But very impressed by the fast startup and performance of this OS on older machines such as the Thinkpad-G41 and Dell XPS400 . It performed with the up-most stability even on the maxed out settings . For older computer models , such as the IBM Thinkpad , there were some graphics drivers I had to do without because that line of laptops are too old for IBM to go back to make Win7 drivers for , and that is not Window 's fault at all . Overall very pleasant experience with Win7 on both machines . Win7 is a win !#### #### ####[([157], [156], 'POS'), ([157], [239], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [156], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [79], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [239], 'POS'), ([159], [156], 'POS'), ([159], [79], 'POS'), ([159], [239], 'POS')]

I made the mistake of purchasing the 3pc edition . I 'm operating windows 8.1 on a new HP desktop system . I backed up my system to an external hard drive the night before . Using Acronis True Image 2015 I : 1 . Tried to clone my hard drive to an SSD . Acronis says it needs to shut down . It starts up , but never comes back to Acronis . 2. I shut off the system and restart it . Nowthe hard drive is not recognized . 3. I now have to use the recovery file to return the system to its original state without any software that was on there before . 4. After returning it to its original state as purchased I reinstall Acronis True image 2015 and try to perform a recovery from the original back up to my hard drive . It recognizes the back up , adds it to the program , and then says it needs to reboot . Guess what , it shuts down , turns on but does n't reboot . I 'm now stuck with another dead drive that needs to be returned to the original state when purchased . This is not the first time I have tried this , I did it earlier this spring with the older version of 2015 .... guess what , same thing . It kills the hard drive and now you have to restore to the original configuration . I swear , I will never use Acronis again . I have used EASEUS on other computers and have never had a problem . I have PAID for the original software and the upgrades , and the so called insurance of having the ability to restore or clone just do n't exist . I do n't need customer support in the first 30 days or so , I need it when the program fails to perform when it is needed to do a simple function that I purchased it for some time ago .#### #### ####[([85, 86], [88, 89], 'NEG'), ([85, 86], [234], 'NEG'), ([85, 86], [322, 323], 'NEG')]

I have a laptop that has Windows 7 . Three days ago I upgraded to the free version of Windows 10 . Immediately I hated what I was seeing - a weird Start menu , lots of Mickey Mouse features that I do n't need and will never use ( and are taking up space on my computer ) , the old & quot ; My Computer & quot ; is now called & quot ; This PC & quot ; , and there were no thumbnails on my video and picture files , which really makes it difficult to easily locate the files you want to use ( that 's an understatement ) . I was ready to downgrade back to Windows 7 until I restarted the computer a couple of times and suddenly good things started happening , such as the thumbnails finally appearing on my video and picture files . So , right now I 'm holding off on the possibility of getting Windows 7 back ( I have another 27 days to decide ) . I 'm getting used to this new Windows 10 , learning to navigate around , etc . A couple of days ago I would have given Windows 10 a 1 star rating , but right now I 'm giving it 3 stars . It could go higher in the future ( or lower ) . So far Windows 10 has been basically cooperative and functional on my laptop , but only time will determine if it 's as good , better , or worse than Windows 7. < br />< br /> UPDATE 8 / 27 / 15 - Goodbye Windows 10 . I uninstalled Windows 10 last night and got my Windows 7 back . When I could n't drag my movie files , video footage clips , pictures , etc. into an existing project or a new project on my video editing software , it was time to get Windows 7 back . Apparently my video editing software is n't fully functional on Windows 10 . The only thing I could do with it was make edits to existing video and audio and burn DVDs of already existing projects , but it would n't allow me to drag new footage , pictures , etc. into it . Sorry , but that was a deal breaker. < br />< br /> Windows 10 .............. not completely necessary . There 's an old saying - If it ai n't broke , then do n't fix it .#### #### ####[([32, 33], [31], 'NEU'), ([32, 33], [24], 'NEU'), ([86], [342], 'NEU'), ([236, 237], [31], 'NEU'), ([236, 237], [24], 'NEU'), ([279, 280], [31], 'NEU'), ([279, 280], [24], 'NEU'), ([321, 322], [342], 'NEU'), ([336, 337], [342], 'NEU')]
I confess at the outset that I have never completely skipped an Office upgrade - though I 'm sure there was a machine here or there that I gave a pass for cost reasons . The reasons do n't always have directly to do with new features . Microsoft Office integrates in sometimes unpredictable ways with other applications . Such dependencies can be important , occasionally more important than new features. < br />< br /> This bundle contains the most important applications in the Office suite , but prospective buyers should check to make sure that this covers what they need . Purchasing individual products ( e.g. , Publisher or Access , which had significant changes in this release ) costs a little more than in a bundle. < br />< br /> Some buyers should also consider Office365 ( cloud ) options. < br />< br /> This bundle uses the new MS Click to Install method .

I 've been using SF Audio Studio 8.0 since 2005 . It has worked on XP , Vista and now Windows 7 . I have n't had any problems with it . I record on a daily basis and consider myself a heavy user . My only complaint is that in the past , I 've had some issues with certain plugins - I had trouble installing them or having the program recognize them . Also , when I re-installed the program on a new PC , there was no way to retain my settings and preferences which was REALLY frustrating . I had to copy down all the settings ( such as EQ , dynamics , compression , etc ...) and then re-program ( re-enter ) them manually in the new install . This is archaic to say the least ! This should be a feature that is standard . It 's a no-brainer and yet it 's not available . I tried upgrading to Audio Studio 10 and I hated it . Could n't get it to work properly so I reverted back to Version 8.0 . Works great . I 'm sticking with it for now . I also use SONY Vegas for all my video editing although I ca n't say as many good things for that program .

After trying for quite a long time to get it installed and going back and forth with Cook'n Tech Support , I finally gave up and just continued to use my old version on my Windows XP machine . Now that Windows XP is toast I have been trying to use this version and cannot keep it running on my computer . Every so often it just quits running . When I contact tech support , they tell me I need to reinstall it which I do , sometimes easily , sometimes painfully , and that keeps it going until the next time it quits . I am getting to the point where I am just not willing to waste my time reinstalling a software that I cannot trust to be stable . On one installation I ended up losing several recipes that I had input . I want a software I can trust . I have reinstalled it one last time , and will be looking around for another recipe software so that I can switch over before this one dies again .#### #### ####[([49], [54, 55], 'NEG'), ([199], [54, 55], 'NEG'), ([199], [197], 'NEG')]

I purchased this to use on a train trip to follow my location . I had trouble getting it to work on either my PC or Mac ( running Bootcamp ) . After several attempts I finally got it to communicate with the GPS unit . Packed it up and went on my trip . On the trip I pulled the computer out and could not get the street guide to communicate with the GPS . the GPS would display the coordinates , but would not talk to the street guide . After play with the street guide software for hours I gave up for the time being . I pulled the computer back out and tried some other options , and FINALLY got it working . The problem now is the map kept rotating as we traveled . I was trying to get the map to keep North to the top and could not figure out how to accomplish this . Every time I would rotate the map so North is up , it would rotate so that the arrow which showed the direction I was traveling would point straight up , even if I was going South . This was very annoying . So I packed up the computer and put it away for the rest of my two week journey .#### #### ####[([68, 69], [16], 'NEG'), ([68, 69], [64, 65], 'NEG'), ([68, 69], [128], 'NEG'), ([68, 69], [203], 'NEG'), ([132], [16], 'NEG'), ([132], [64, 65], 'NEG'), ([132], [128], 'NEG'), ([132], [203], 'NEG'), ([180], [16], 'NEG'), ([180], [64, 65], 'NEG'), ([180], [128], 'NEG'), ([180], [203], 'NEG')]

The computer age is on us , and kids need to know how to type in order to succeed in school and in their future . I had taken typing in high school and this brought back memories of typing drills and repetition . But we did n't have dragons and castles in our typing class ! This definitely appeals to my younger daughters ages 8 and 9 . The game loaded easily and started immediately . Each girl was able to put her name in and then pick an icon . The program saves their progress individually . The program also teaches them hand placement , which benefits them as they are trying to beat their own scores . Definitely recommend. < br />< br /> Special note : I am often provided a sample for review and testing at a discounted price .

As anyone who has anything even remotely to do with business , spreadsheets , word processing , and presentations , Microsoft Office has been the standard for years . Having a personal version of Microsoft Office that was about 10 years old , I was long due for an upgrade. < br />< br /> I received the keycard version of Office 2013 .

Also in the box was a small card giving the product key. < br />< br /> Being a fan of Windows XP and having XP on 3 out of 4 PCs , I was caught offguard when I tried to install Word on one of my PCs with XP on it and found that it would not install .

I assembled a new computer to perform some system resource-intensive tasks to include video editing , and decided NOT to go with Windows 8 because lack of a fully functioning Windows 7-type Start menu severely disrupts my workflow ; furthermore , Windows 8 is NOT bundled with the necessary CODECs to play DVD movies ( you have to install 3rd party software for this ) .

Not sure why some reviews berate the fact that they have to jump through hoops get this installed . Basically , you do need to have business email to start the registration with onmicrosoft.com . Once you register your account you can install the software on your computer and any other computers just by logging on to the portal.office.com page . The other features like email and sharing services are bit more complicated requiring you to add DNS server information to your domain .

This is pirated software . After installing , it took all of about 1 hour for Microsoft to disable it , then after trying to restart my computer , it would not start up , it would not even go into BIOS .

The seller refused to refund me because I had already opened the package . DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES .

Norton seems to be quite adept at keeping me virus free , even blocking sites which are suspicious and giving me detailed info regarding same. < br /> The downside : Norton installs its own search engine , which blocked me from using Google. < br /> Fortunately , I ran Malwarebytes ( a free program ) which brought back my Google. < br /> As good as it is at keeping my PC safe , it is prone to being power hungry , meaning : The program tries to take over my PC with quirky < br /> add-ons. < br /> That said , watch what you download when an offer from Norton pops up !#### #### ####[([51], [54], 'POS'), ([51], [29], 'POS'), ([87], [29], 'POS'), ([87], [95], 'POS')]

I am a big fan of this sequel and I have played it since its launch in 2001 . This game is really good but not great . Honestly , I was expecting more from Firefly Studios . This game could 've been much better in graphics and gameplay . The graphics are simple but sill demanding . I am running this game with AMD Radeon HD 6990M Crossfire and 32GM Corsair DDRAM3 . Its running smooth but becomes heavy as time passes . The gameplay is the same as old days releases . That 's why I think that this game is made for those fans who still want to play the original game without any really new addition to the formula . However , the AI is a bit crazy here . It keeps attacking and generating units even when hitting its supplies , food production and income generation facilities . Having said that , you always need to defend your castle until the Al spends all its resources in attacking you . I find this annoying and time consuming because you need to build your resources while defending your castle before being able to attack and finish your opponent . Additionally , this game does n’t really have a campaign and instead relies on skirmishes , which can provide you with a worthwhile gaming experience . However , the gameplay is quite repetitive which shows that Firefly Studios failed to innovate anything . The game also lacks of interesting units , underdeveloped castle-building options , and basic tutorials which holds the game back if compared with nowadays gaming engines . Overall , this game is unique in many other aspects and worth playing given its current market value . I look forward to see new releases of this franchise with real development from Firefly Studios .#### #### ####[([48], [56], 'POS'), ([48], [235], 'POS'), ([46], [53], 'POS'), ([46], [56], 'POS'), ([46], [235], 'POS'), ([51], [53], 'POS'), ([51], [56], 'POS'), ([51], [235], 'POS')]

Disappointing support from the developer .

This disk was part of a project to replace my wife 's dead drive and upgrade her 6 year old laptop from Vista to Windows 7 . The first part was to obtain a hard drive which was accomplished first . Doing a clean install is not all that hard but it is also not something I would want to tackle if I had no experience . I have not done a clean install since the days of DOS so I was not sure what to expect . The first time I started up the disk I had the boot order set to CD first then HDD . I was assuming that the disc would have everything needed to load it and then boot from the hard drive . I got the message that the booy manager could not be found . I then made a Windows 7 Repair disk and ran the Startup Repair task . This ran for a couple hours ( really ) and finally finished . Once you start the program will not let you cancel . After the startup repair completed I then tried the Windows 7 disc again and it came up fine . Selected Custom Install and the rest was smooth . There was no problem with the Key that was on the disc sleeve . That was fine . I was worried at first because I had read some of the reviews saying there were problems . Well if there were I did not notice any . And I 'm sure the license was accepted be cause when I checked on updates there were 194 updates that all loaded .#### #### ####[([136], [137, 138], 'POS'), ([136], [212], 'POS')]

I use it mostly as a mark book and like how it calculates the average right away . I can change what value each mark should have at any time . The information is well organized in simple to read charts . I understand that some users expect a lot more out of this product . I have not bothered to use some of the features and it has worked well for me . Besides , I do not have a problem to copy and save my files , as another user explained . You can save your files on a flash drive , if you are worried your computer brakes down , and then install the program on another computer and upload the saved files . I had to do this once and it worked well .#### #### ####[([123], [10], 'POS'), ([123], [128], 'POS'), ([123], [194], 'POS')]

The Corel PaintShop Pro for PC systems is the newest graphics editing software I 've bought in a long time . I have been happy with my old PaintShopPro7 made by Jasc but it runs on XP . Corel bought the Jasc software and has been producing their versions since . The Corel PSP X7 Ultimate program that I just bought is a photo and graphics editor . It has many photo editing features , and I was pleased to see it will use the old effects filters that I have . From my research , this program is the best for the price range for me . Perhaps the only things I dislike are the very tiny icons and menu text . I like how it works in layers that are easy to track , and most of the tools are familiar . It works with a lot of formats . One can edit photos or create drawings , sketches etc , with Text enabled . This text tool is not as easy to use as my oldie 's , but I can figure out the quirks . All in all , I recommend this software .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [9], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [194], 'POS'), ([120, 121], [142], 'POS'), ([120, 121], [117], 'POS'), ([140], [142], 'POS'), ([118], [117], 'POS')]

Technology and video games can be a fun way for a child to gain essential vocabulary and other language skills . Words Rock : Building Word Skills is a fun place for a young child to gain exposure to literacy skills . My young son ( age 5 ) enjoyed playing this game . He enjoys &# 34 ; busting slugs &# 34 ; as he practices a variety of literacy skills , including grammar , spelling , vocab , and more . The graphics are imaginative and fun enough to capture my son 's attention . Different available skills levels help this game grow with my child and can be used at a variety of ages . The game has a option for a multiplayer mode , so my son can play with friends ( all can compete set at their own level ,) or independantly against the computer . The game is easy to use . It is has been on the market for some time now , and while it may not be the newest game n the market , it still holds fun and educational value . It is affordably priced . This program is simple and quick to instal. < br /> I got the opportunity to try this game for free in exchange for my honest review .#### #### ####[([84], [154], 'POS'), ([84], [86], 'POS'), ([84], [88], 'POS'), ([156], [154], 'POS')]

I have been considering purchasing the omnipage 18 for quite a while .

I have a third grader and a first grader and was hoping that it would help them both with their spelling . My third grader absolutely loved this ! He had fun with the practices and was able to do the challenges with his dad and I. The reason I gave this four stars was because it was hard for my first grader to be able to keep up with the rest of us . This definitely helps out when it comes to spelling and also for becoming more proficient with their vocabulary . I had no trouble installing this on our computer and it runs well .

This review addresses the questions I had as an Apple Mac user considering this product . The 5-star rating is not my evaluation of Windows 7 Home Premium as an operating system ( it 's not my first-choice OS or even my second ) but simply means that the System Builder DVD fulfilled its intended purpose of installing Windows 7 on a single computer in an easy , hassle-free way. < br />< br /> You can ignore the technobabble about OPK on the box and just do a straightforward installation in the emulation environment of your choice . Instead of Apple Boot Camp ( which requires rebooting the machine to switch between operating systems ) , I prefer Oracle VM VirtualBox , which lets Windows run within OS X , rather as products like Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion do . Those commercial products arguably have more features and better integration with OS X , but virtualbox.org offers an elegant open-source solution that does everything I need. < br />< br /> As other reviewers have stressed , this System Builder version installs ...

I 've been using Windows 7 now for a few years , finally upgrading from XP which had served me well for many years but was starting to show its age . It took some time to get used to the new start menu and task bar in 7 but once I did it 's fantastic . The UI is beautiful and glossy with a sleek looking transparency effect on window borders , a stark contrast to the drab flat , square stripped look that has become common in recent years . Stability is rock solid and performance is great . This boots to the desktop in less than 15 minutes from a mid-range SSD and it has been very stable on all three systems I have it on . I have only a few gripes , Wordpad and Paint have the hideous and cumbersome ribbon interface but with instructions I found online I was able to transplant the versions from Vista with traditional menus and they work perfectly . The calculator has also been redesigned and is almost unusable for my purposes as I frequently use it to convert between decimal , hex and binary but it was easy to replace it with calc.exe from XP which also works flawlessly . Windows 7 is an excellent operating system , in my opinion the pinnacle of Windows evolution from Microsoft . I shudder to think what I will do when it finally becomes obsolete .#### #### ####[([58], [60], 'POS'), ([58], [62], 'POS'), ([58], [216], 'POS'), ([97], [99], 'POS'), ([97], [168], 'POS'), ([97], [210], 'POS'), ([45, 46], [99], 'POS'), ([45, 46], [168], 'POS'), ([45, 46], [179], 'POS'), ([45, 46], [210], 'POS'), ([92], [142], 'POS'), ([92], [55], 'POS'), ([92], [65], 'POS'), ([92], [99], 'POS'), ([92], [144], 'POS'), ([92], [168], 'POS'), ([92], [210], 'POS'), ([137], [142], 'POS'), ([137], [55], 'POS'), ([137], [144], 'POS'), ([137], [168], 'POS'), ([137], [179], 'POS'), ([137], [210], 'POS'), ([145, 146], [142], 'POS'), ([145, 146], [144], 'POS'), ([145, 146], [179], 'POS'), ([145, 146], [210], 'POS'), ([42, 43], [168], 'POS')]

Cook'n 11 is my 3rd cookbook software . I find it somewhat overwhelming at times . I had a simpler one years ago that I enjoyed more but when Windows 7 came out the software was no longer compatable . I especially do n't like the Cook'n 11 cookbook printout . Each recipe has the cookbook name and the category above the recipe that makes the recipe more cluttered not to mention the paper and ink it uses . I have tried to change the printout layout but have had no success. < br /> There are a few glitches that are a real pain for I have to go all the way out and then back in to fix them . Like it skips over from quantity to ingredient and there is a space between . So when hitting the tab key it skips that space . I was a data entry operator for years and one thing I first learned was to count the spaces or how many times I would hit the tab key to get from one space to another . So when it skips , it throws me off. < br /> There is more in the program that I do n't use . I have tried to move recipes from one place to another an it is just a pain and takes less time just to type it out. < br /> But , I have found the help from Dan Oaks has been spectacular. < br /> I will continue to use the program being I spent the money on it . I just wish it was somewhat simpler. < br /> I have written 8 cookbooks so really want the program to work up to my expectations .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [42, 43], 'NEU'), ([0, 1], [205, 206], 'NEU'), ([0, 1], [225], 'NEU'), ([34], [36, 37], 'NEU'), ([34], [42, 43], 'NEU'), ([34], [205, 206], 'NEU'), ([34], [225], 'NEU')]

I have used Dragon for years . I am using the Premium version of 13.0 I probably have several thousand hours of experience dictating to a version of dragon over the last 15 years . I have used the cheap corded microphone that Nuance includes with the product . I have used other corded microphones . I used a Plantronics BT300 Bluetooth headset for months and found that better in some ways but I had to speak fairly loudly for Dragon to accurately pick up my speech . When Nuance very excitedly offered their Nuance Dragon 13.0 headset and gave all of the positive statements about how well it worked , I was hooked enough to believe that perhaps it might work . It has been nothing but difficulty out of the box . As a previous reviewer stated , my $ 100 produced a 4-inch long gray cardboard tube with the headset and dongle as well as a single page , fine print set of instructions . It has been difficult to get the headset to pair at times , right now being another of those times ! I do not care whether Nuance states that it immediately pairs when you plug in the dongle before you start Dragon , sometimes it works , more times than not it does not ! ! Honestly , I thought early on that I should just return it to Nuance and ask for my money back . Stupid me ! I did not do that . I should have sent it back ! By the Plantronics product that looks similar if you want to try one of these wireless microphones . Do not buy this Nuance Dragon product . It is cheap and intermittent at best !#### #### ####[([277], [39], 'NEG')]

I upgraded from 8.1 to 10 . Short summary : Windows 10 is essentially Windows 7 with more &# 34 ; invasive &# 34 ; settings to turn off and more programs that I do n't use to turn off. < br />< br /> It has automatic updates that you receive whether you like it or not , which is good because a week after I upgraded , the first major update arrived on 8 / 5 / 15 which was needed to fix the major crashes Windows 10 did . For a week I was panicked after upgrading to 10 because of blue screen system crashes , but the 8 / 5 automatic updates fixed it well ( so far ).< br />< br /> On the plus side , Windows 10 is better than 8 and 8.1. and I figured out how to deactivate MOST of the Metro UI . The Metro UI is a complete FAILURE than MS should have gotten rid of completely but has left remnants of in the start menu bar. < br />< br /> On the negative side , Windows 10 is worse than Windows 7 other than it 's newer and therefore will be supported by MS longer than 7 ( hopefully ) . It is much more invasive than Windows 7 and requires more settings to turn off to get performance and privacy better .#### #### ####[([150, 151], [21], 'NEG'), ([150, 151], [159], 'NEG'), ([154, 155], [191], 'NEG'), ([154, 155], [218], 'NEG'), ([154, 155], [21], 'NEG'), ([154, 155], [159], 'NEG'), ([188, 189], [191], 'NEG'), ([188, 189], [218], 'NEG'), ([188, 189], [135], 'NEG'), ([132, 133], [191], 'NEG'), ([132, 133], [135], 'NEG')]

Typing Tournament by Ed Alive is definitely a good way to learn how to perfect your typing skills . To play this game it would be good if you already knew how to use a keyboard and had a feel for just typing , even if you are just typing one letter at a time . Being familiar with the keyboard would really help . With that I put the disk in and started it up . It was very easy to download . I did it on my MAC computer at work so that my students could take advantage of the software next year . ( My personal hope is that this will one day be a digital download because its awesome and i 'd like to use it on my chromebooks ) . So , it prompts you to put in your name and pick a picture icon for yourself . Once you do that you go through a tutorial explaining the keyboard , what to do , how to type , hand placements . There are a ton of lessons and drills . You go through a map successfully completing all of your tasks to move on . I happen to really like the drills . I was sitting there just playing and typing and I was typing 26 words per minute . Which for me is slow but just to sit there and practice it was a little tricky . So , I think the drills are really great for children just learning to type . You start with all of the keys on your left hand and you use the letters A,S,D,F . There are a ton of mixed words they make ( some words are not actually real words but a combination of letters ) and you have to type as much as you can in three minutes . At the end it tells you how many characters you typed ; how many mistakes you made and how many words you typed per minutes . I think this is definitely a great feature . As you move on through the game you start to use more letters and then learn the keys on your other hand as well in a similar manner . I think this is an absolutely amazing way to learn typing . It mimics a lot of what I learned in middle school on how to type with a typewriter . I would HIGHLY recommend this to others ... It says first grade and up but personally I would wait until about 7 or 8 when they have a better fundamental knowledge of using a keyboard and a computer . I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and true findings .#### #### ####[([164], [80], 'POS'), ([164], [347], 'POS')]

All in all , I am very satisfied , primarily due to the cost savings . We were looking at literally hundreds and hundreds of dollars to convert the VHS tapes we have if we had gone through a commercial service to transfer them . There are some frustrating moments in learning the software but they have popups to help . I just learned from Roxio Tech Support ( apparently now Corel ) that the split function is limited to two hour recordings . He recommended that I split my initial recording from VHS to computer into two-hour segments before I attempted any burning . I have n't even bothered to test the feature of going directly from VHS to DVD . With disk space so cheap , why not do any burning from the &# 34 ;. mpg &# 34 ; that is already saved to disk ? There are bugs in the software but workarounds can be found . This goes to some ( unnecessary ) time in learning the software idiosyncrasies . There are other features that I have n't bothered to test . I just want the data saved electronically !#### #### ####[([53], [48], 'POS'), ([53], [151], 'POS'), ([178], [48], 'POS'), ([75, 76], [48], 'POS'), ([75, 76], [78], 'POS'), ([123, 124], [126], 'POS')]

In relation to costs and the amount of revenues they earn , MSFT continues to be the worst software provider . Each update rearranges or changes the look of the program for additional cost WITHOUT fixing any existing bugs that constantly cause the program to crash ; instead , these new versions add more bugs to the existing ones causing more crashes ( and lost work ) .

I have been using ESET for about five years and have been very satisfied with its overall effectiveness but this purchase started out on a bad footing . The item I purchased was this 2015 Edition . What I received was the 2014 Edition . I realize this is the fault of the vendor and not the ESET product . I decided to go ahead and install it rather than argue with the vendor . My thinking is that there is probably not much difference in the functionality between the two editions and knowing the virus database is updated daily . Do n't know if this is accurate or not . The product installed without any problems and is working fine on the first installation . I have , however , been unsuccessful in getting it installed on the second desktop computer . As I recall with previous versions of the product the second installation does not go very smoothly . This time it was much more difficult and I have yet to get it successfully installed on the second computer . This is due primarily to the fact that a laptop is my primary device , with this desktop only being my secondary device . After reaching my frustration level I have yet to contact ESET for assistance with the installation. < br />< br /> Bottom line , I would recommend ESET as long as you just go with a single user version .#### #### ####[([87], [25], 'NEG'), ([87], [167], 'NEG'), ([87], [232], 'NEG'), ([154], [25], 'NEG'), ([154], [167], 'NEG')]

There simply is so much in saying that Microsoft has came a long way since they hit it big with Windows and the operating systems . They have not only been a lifeline , but they have been the central device in operating the computer . Microsoft has done that well since Windows ' 95 became popular you really had to own a Windows or a Apple computer . But , there have been some ups and downs with the previous versions from Windows 7 and Windows 8 . Nevertheless , they have decided to merge all of the best of Windows XP and Windows 8 with Windows 10 . This operating system is a bit more streamlined , than with the bulky desktop menu from 8 & 8.1 . Nevertheless , it is a good operating system that has a lot to offer from a simpler menu , that return to the classic format of Windows before . My one gripe about this one though is that it can take more time to load on older computers with Windows 7 , other than 8 & 8.1 .

Had no idea that the program specs were outdated and would not work on my computer. < br /> Product only works on Windows 98 and I ca n't find an old system to use it on . However , I acknowledge that is my fault , I should have looked at the specs for the program before ordering it . My son really needs this program , but it is of no use .#### #### ####[([5, 6], [8], 'NEG'), ([5, 6], [11, 12], 'NEG'), ([5, 6], [72, 73], 'NEG')]
DO NOT PURCHASE - I 've been a PC Technician for over 20 years. < br /> The good news : This copy of Windows 7 Pro did install and register without incident. < br /> The bad news : Windows updates are permanently disabled and ca n't be fixed . The DVD was also lacking the proper Microsoft hologram . It does indeed display a &# 34 ; Genuine &# 34 ; icon in computer properties but I ran a Windows update repair fix directly from Microsoft it found corrupted files , fixed them but still will not load any Windows updates . This issue will render the Windows 7 Operating System vulnerable to a host of viruses and malware infections . I will be demanding a refund from Amazon .#### #### ####[([41], [113], 'NEG'), ([41], [44], 'NEG'), ([41], [55], 'NEG')]
Similar to Windows 7 but just a refined more plain look . I do n't like my start menu too cluttered so I removed all the tiles on the right side of the start menu as well as the middle section on the left . Not a bad operating system because it is similar to Windows 7 which I was becoming familiar with . Also , I can make google chrome and gmail and all my other Google stuff available like on my mobile devices and I do n't have to use Microsoft Edge , but this version of Windows still has Media Player which I use extensively , and a Music , and Documents folder which I was also using in the past and can still use on this version of Windows .#### #### ####[([10], [47], 'POS'), ([18], [20], 'POS'), ([18], [23], 'POS'), ([48, 49], [47], 'POS')]

I am still very much a beginner , but thus far am very pleased with Rocket Spanish .

Personally , I found this product extremely confusing and complicated to use . I much prefer my much older version of FTM , Version Eleven , from many years ago . This older version was a basic data base that allowed you to create simple family trees . But it stopped working on newer versions of Windows . Maybe I 'm just getting old . For many years , FTM has been the &# 34 ; gold standard &# 34 ; of ancestry software . This version has many features and works grreat , if you can figure the darn thing out .#### #### ####[([11], [7], 'NEU'), ([11], [9], 'NEU'), ([11], [92], 'NEU'), ([89], [88], 'NEU')]

Still not up to par with Quicken 2005. < br /> In July 2015 , I made a serious attempt to migrate to Quicken 2015 as I really want to get off MacOS Snow Leopard , but had to give up and revert to Q2005. < br /> The killer for me is the lack of lot tracking in brokerage accounts. < br /> The program would fail to import from Q2005 with no helpful explanation to why . Eventually , only my transactions could be carried over . No stock quotes , which had to be downloaded anew . Some other information was lost. < br /> As I had to abandon my use of Q2015 , this is not an in-depth review . Maybe there are workarounds still to be found. < br /> Many other shortcomings could be worked around , but would slow me down , would not match the efficiency of Q2005. < br /> For example , only the subcategory is displayed in Category fields . This means that Meals for business travel cannot be distinguished from Meals for vacation travel . Sure makes it more cumbersome when doing expense reports. < br /> All register entries are now one-liners . You can display the fields you used in Quicken 2005 , but this results in a much wider window . Inconvenient , when you have many registers and your bank website open at the same time. < br /> No calendar , so no overview of scheduled transactions. < br /> Everything now lives in the sidebar . Might be OK for those with a small amount of accounts , reports etc. < br /> I used many of Q2005 's reports and graphics . Most are not there any longer . Seems like I can create them as custom reports , but it would result in a long , unstructured , user-antagonistic list in the sidebar. < br /> Needs more work to meet the needs of the power users , but should be great for the light user. < br /> Eagerly awaiting Q2016 ...#### #### ####[([65], [67], 'NEG')]
It works very well . More than I expected . It does however need an instruction manual for editing etc . The only way I learned how to use it was to watch you tube . Not easy while you try to edit .

Am I the only one that feels this way ? It ’s as if my long time maid suddenly says she will clean the house for free . Afterwards , I feel something ’s wrong . Things are missing , chairs are moved , an odd piece was left in the bedroom , and what ’s that dinging ? Do I ignore all that because it was free and the maid is familiar ? This is the Windows 10 installation . I picked custom installation because it was discouraged by the small typeface . Express would have let Microsoft take huge liberties with my computer . Reading the Cortana privacy statement said it all , “ Microsoft collects and uses your location and location history , calendar details , content and communication history from messages and aps , and other information on your device … In order to personalize your experience and provide the best possible suggestions , Cortana collects information about your contacts ( People ) including their title and / or suffix , first name , last name , middle name , nicknames , and company name .

I got a ding and an intrusive bar advertising Office . My computer runs slow . I am spending many hours trying to get my computer back to where I can use it my way . Oh , no ! ! What have I done ?

I updated Windows 10 on my Surface Pro 2 and that update went well . My experience with my Windows 7 desktop has been very disappointing . First I ran into the &# 34 ; modern host has stopped working &# 34 ; error . Tried the following to fix it : - graphics driver is updated - network adapter is up to date - removed antivirus - tried downloading from Windows update directly - downloaded from the Windows 10 app . The app would download and pop up the error AND START THE DOWNLOAD ALL OVER AGAIN . - shutdown and restarted computer - deleted certain temporary files linked to the update process to do a fresh update . - performed a clean boot I then tried the media creator method from Microsoft and created the bootable flash drive setup . So that asked for a product key and when I tried to skip , it said I needed to restart and run the setup from Windows . I then ran the setup from Windows but it does n't give me the option to skip . Is this what I get out of a free product ? An installation that is not even possible ? Let me guess , it 'll work after the year time frame when I have to pay for the damn thing . Maybe Microsoft has set up these errors so people will give up and just pay for the OS to get the product key . If anyone knows how I can obtain the product key that would be wonderful . Installing this on my Windows 7 computer has been just a hassle and the worst installation I have ever dealt with . UPDATE : So I was finally able to install Windows 10 after deleting temp install files . Recently ran the November 2015 updates and it completely screwed up my computer . BSOD popped up and there were no roll back or restore options for Windows 10 . Also no way to get into safe mode . The only option was to factory reset back to Windows 7 . Fortunately , my important files are saved in the cloud . This is the worst software experience I 've ever had and Microsoft should of never released this or at least label it as alpha or beta . After this , I 'm thinking of looking intoApple computers because Microsoft brings hassle with their software and is VERY behind in mobile .#### #### ####[([199], [371], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], [25], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], [281], 'NEG'), ([53, 54], [25], 'NEG'), ([53, 54], [56], 'NEG'), ([53, 54], [281], 'NEG'), ([53, 54], [371], 'NEG'), ([58, 59], [61, 62], 'NEG'), ([78, 79], [25], 'NEG'), ([78, 79], [61, 62], 'NEG'), ([137, 138], [25], 'NEG'), ([137, 138], [61, 62], 'NEG'), ([282], [25], 'NEG'), ([282], [281], 'NEG'), ([282], [371], 'NEG')]
I had built myself a brand new computer and I was n't sure that this was what I needed .

I bought a PC about a month ago with Windows 8 on it , and I hated the operating system , so when I found out that I could get a free upgrade to Windows 10 I immediately jumped at the opportunity because I did n't think it could be any worse than Windows 8 . After installation , I noticed that my computer would just run really slow , it 's brand new and has plenty of resources , I did n't purchase a low end machine , so it easily met the requirements for the OS , for whatever reason it runs very sluggish , like if I click on an app to open or even windows explorer it may take over a minute before it comes up on my screen , yet when I go into task manager most of my resources are idling , so I do n't understand what the issue is . I find it absolutely amazing and pathetic at the same time , that Microsoft after 30 years of making operating systems , ca n't make something that just works . How can machines that had thousands of times less resources run windows better in the 90 's than the current machines today ? Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves , if any other company did this they 'd be out of business . The only reason that they are able to sell operating systems is because a Mac has to much of a markup and most people out there are either unaware that Linux exists or do n't feel comfortable going through the install . The consumers really do n't have many alternatives . The only thing that consumers want is a stable reliable OS that works , how is this difficult to understand ? The only reason I gave it a 2 star instead of a 1 is because it has a start button and some of the familiar windows features are back , but how slow it is , is not acceptable , not in 2015 .#### #### ####[([18, 19], [105], 'NEG'), ([18, 19], [16], 'NEG')]

I thought this was going to be really good OS turned out to be a nightmare almost screwed up my brand new computer slowed it down kept having problems with Internet even thou I am directly connected via cable . And the cpu is have almost triple the load with the stupid background apps and other stuff running yeah you can shut them off or do what ever but that 's just a pin to go through and even still they just come back using power and more do n't get me wrong it looked amazing and I think windows 10 is a huge leap from Windows 8 but I feel windows 10 is just a more refined version of touch based os or he 'll even like an android system. .

I purchased a copy of Win8.1 for a plex media server that runs 24 / 7 and I also use it as a slave computer for running virtual instruments for Logic Pro . I built the system myself - it 's an i3 / Gigabyte Mobo / 8gb ram - nothing spectacular . Previously this system was a Hackintosh , then a Linux distro - both pains in the butt for my application . All the other systems in our household are Apple. < br />< br /> I was fully prepared to hate Win8 based on the howls of pain from all the Microsoft die-hards . So I opened the package , put in the DVD and started the installation ready for the worst . Then , to my surprise , 15 minutes later Windows was installed with barely any input from me . The annoying UAC was still present from Vista and 7 , so I disabled it - no big deal . I played around with the new tile-based start screen for a while .

It helps block websites that could have a risk of viruses or hackers. < br />< br /> With the total protection , this is one HUGE thing I no longer have to worry about !#### #### ####[([4, 5, 6], [216], 'POS')]

My old photoshop elements ( version 6 ) would no longer work with the latest Apple OS X 10 Yosemite so I had to discard it .

Bought this because of the reasonable price for a full install version of Win 7 . I emailed their support to get reassurance after receiving the product that it was truly a legal copy and a full install , not an upgrade version . That was because of the ambiguous wording on the install DVD , which was originally with a Dell machine . They responed very quickly and assured me it would install and run Ok . It was shipped and received within a couple of days and was the easiest windows install I have ever done . I suppose that is because of Microsoft and not this vendor but it was still great. < br /> I installed this a as virtual machine using virtualbox on a host Windows 8 Laptop with lots of disc and ram .

I wrote an earlier set of comments on Windows 7 Home OEM Builders Edition , but later discovered several errors in my facts. < br /> This is my final , and hopefully accurate , assessment. < br />< br /> I gather there are four differences between the OEM version and retail , here they are :< br />< br /> 1 : You can only choose one version , 32-bit or 64-bit , but will not receive both discs , as in the retail version. < br /> 2 : You can only install on one system . The OS is &# 34 ; married &# 34 ; to the motherboard and cannot be transferred to another computer. < br /> 3 : You can NOT install later upgrades , such as the soon to be released Windows 8. < br /> 4 : You will be entitled to updates and KB bulletins , but not phone or e-mail support for problems. < br />< br /> I am not 100 % sure about the upgrade option , but the other facts are apparently correct. < br /> As for me , the OEM restrictions are acceptable .

I have upgraded my Pinnacle Studio software since originally purchasing Version 9 . There have been learning curves with each upgrade , but reasonable one . This latest version is another thing altogether . I have no real sense of whether the program works well or not because the one thing I can say is that the new controls and interface are crap . It is a whole new program to learn . Nothing remains familiar or even intuitive . I have to look up how to use everything and spend too much time doing this . I finally went back to my older V 15 just because this was too hard to learn and I did n't buy it to learn a new program , I bought it hoping I could get new features in a familiar OS . Not so .

I had written my review for over an hour now , detailing all of the issues , my e-mails with customer service but my system crashed and I lost it . Probably better this way since I do n't think anybody would have read it. < br />< br /> Here is the short version : no problems with my home computer , used by one person in an unofficial , non-business setting for 6 years . Thought I 'd clean it up anyway , just in case . Received this program for a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review . No instructions , no registration , just a disc in cardboard sleeve with a piece of paper with the access code. < br /> Program took over 6 hours before crashing . Messed up other programs on my computer , probably why it crashed while writing my review . 7 days of working with customer service , lots of screen shots and being talked to like this was all my doing . I spent days with the crashing , useless software , telling me that I had over 120,000 plus errors which is not very believable. < br /> Finally the development team got involved , analyzed and fixed &# 34 ; my issues &# 34 ; , meaning they first gave me new software to replace the outdated one they told me I was given , hesitated to give me the new access code , readdressed my issues , updated their software , tried it out on me again , updated it some more before posting it on their website. < br /> I wanted to give up halfway through but the program had already screwed up my whole computer to where I needed a fix . I did finally give up but customer service got back to me , informing me of the final new software . I tried it , it only took minutes showing less than 700 problems , fixed them and rescanned , still finding more errors even though the computer had n't been touched . Some of my regular programs are still not working properly now but I ca n't afford to get a real professional to look at it . Cheaper to just buy a new computer these days. < br /> I will be returning the disc and asking for my $ 4 back just to prove a point and make myself feel better. < br /> Do not buy this program !

I ordered this operating system to replace XP since Microsoft has decided not to support XP any longer . I was concerned that the OEM version might not install without the OEM installation software , but it installed just fine . Windows 7 is a bit different than XP but it is very stable and I did n't want to put up with the Windows 8 / 8.1 hastles I had read about . I am happy with my purchase . The only downside is the complete lack of documentation with the OEM version .#### #### ####[([41, 42], [39], 'POS'), ([41, 42], [83], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [83], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [87], 'POS'), ([89], [83], 'POS'), ([89], [87], 'POS')]
Stopzilla works great and the freebie versions works much better than AVG , Norton , and Malwarebytes . I bought a lifetime key from Stopzilla Malwarebytes in 2004 . There were times when I needed to reload SZ and the company never gave me a hassle about it and always sent me a link to do so . In 2012 , I bought the laptop that I am typing from and I decided to go with Norton 360 for the first year and then used the Comcast free version from 2013 thru last week . I bought it but the main reason is that 360 cleans registries also and a few other things which cut down on my overall costs because I was using four different softwares to do the job that 360 could do in one . Well last week when I uploaded WIN10 , 360 crashed my system and as of last night , I finally finished deleted 100 % of 360 off of my system . Meanwhile , I used the free version SZ antimalwarebytes and it found 39 infections , something 360 and Malwarebytes never found . I then asked them if they could possibly reinstate my lifetime key , which I figured that they would not because I had n't used their version in three years and they allowed it . That was awesome of them . Now I am using their free version SZ antivirus and it fould 4 threats that 360 never found so I am going to buy their full version of this and not go back to 360 . Another reason is because SZ did their homework and got their software ready for WIN10 , Norton 360 did not . They actually have said in their forum rooms that they are &# 34 ; working on it &# 34 ; . Really ? Why were n't they working on it six months ago and got their customer 's squared away before this fiasco stated ? Stopzilla did .#### #### ####[([149], [147], 'POS'), ([0], [2], 'POS'), ([0], [147], 'POS')]

My view on Software and Support is that both belong together . If i multiply the software with 0 ( Support ) the resut is ZERO . Here is why : I have upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 and was asked to re-enter my Serial # for Web Easy . Suprise : Product is already registered - buy a new license . What ?!?! ? Send multiple notes to Avanquest to solve the issue ( by the way : I have exactly the same problem with another Avanquest product ) . No response , just bombarded with other emails to buy products from them. < br />< br /> I expect this company will disappear rather sooner than later - if you want to rebuy their software evertime you upgrade or change Hardware you can support this company otherwise avoid them .#### #### ####[([5], [25], 'NEG'), ([3], [25], 'NEG')]

The Office applications are as one would expect of them , incremental advancements over prior versions with a user facing a learning curve to become accustomed to the changes from what they were previously using. < br />< br /> My big difficultly with Microsoft has been the update to Windows 8.0 and 8.1. < br />< br /> 658 updates to Windows 8.0 on my laptop required straight out of the box taking 4.5 hours on high speed internet connection to download and another 3 plus hours to install just to bring Windows 8.0 current and then another 3.5 hours to update to 8.1 . Then one is faced with the illogical and inefficiencies of dealing with Windows 8.1 as compared to earlier Windows operating systems .

This program has gone downhill since Insperity bought it from Knowledge Point . I learned today ( September 9 , 2015 ) the product has a known defect . The table of contents will not paginate topics correctly . A policy may be on one page , but the TOC may list it as being on another page . Apparently there have been numerous complaints , but the vendor has not corrected the problem . I finally had to export the policies in Word and build a TOC from scratch .

I am very happy with Windows 10 . A very small learning curve and very stable . All my software runs on it and the upgrade ran very smoothly . You choose whether you use Cortana or not and can control the information that is retrieved . This is no different from using Google Now or even Siri . All the other settings can also be switched off . You are in control and can decide which applications you use . I am writing this review on a computer running Windows 10 and all my other devices will be upgraded . I never use the start menu so I have no idea what all the fuss was about , search and pin the programs you use a lot to the task bar . I did try to use OSX for a while on a Mac but that was a dreadful user experience and had a much larger learning curve than moving from 7 to 8.1 to 10 . I would recommend to anyone . If you need to play a DVD there is loads of free software that can do it .#### #### ####[([151], [149], 'POS'), ([151], [28], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [149], 'POS'), ([105, 106], [28], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [149], 'POS')]
Braintastic Work Skills Pre-K-3rd Grade computer game is educational and fun ! Because the game said from PreK to 3rd grade I thought my 2 year old daughter might be able to play some of the games on here . Well that was n't exactly the case . I know she 's not in PreK yet but after playing the game with her I 'm not sure I know of any PreK student that would be able to play this game without assistance . When I went to the menu I only saw games for 2nd grade . Since I decided this was n't a game for my daughter I let my godson play . He 's going to the 2nd grade . Now he absolutely loved this game , even cried when I told him he had to cut the game off . I love how the game captured his attention and actually taught him and made him think . I usually do n't like kids playing on a computer or tablet all day , but since this was educational I was okay with it . I gave him the game and his mom says he plays it after camp . So to recap I gave 4 / 5 stars because I did n't see any PreK related games . I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [0], 'POS')]

Several years ago , I stopped using anti-virus programs after the trend of nagging to upgrade became standard practice --- behaving like pop-up viruses themselves , However , after having been hit with a Trojan recently , I started shopping for an anti-virus program to get rid of it . I have a dual boot system consisting of Windows 7 and Fedora Linux and hence was still able to use the PC with little concern ( Win 7 was hit ; Linux was not ).< br />< br /> The Trojan that infected my Win 7 installation appears to be a variant of fileless viruses as described in these insightful articles published on the Malwarebytes website titled ' Fileless Infections from Exploit Kit : An Overview ' by Jérôme Segura ( https :// blog.malwarebytes.org / exploits-2 / 2014 / 09 / fileless-infections-from-exploit-kit-an-overview /) ; and ' No More Poweliks !' by Adam Kujawa ( https :// blog.malwarebytes.org / security-threat / 2014 / 11 / no-more-poweliks /).< br />< br /> I wo n't go into the articles except to say that reading them was an eye-opener into the sophist ...

Outstanding . Was using Photoshop elements and occasionally Gimp , but now use those for touch up purposes only . DxO is my go to now for quick easy improvement of pictures straight out of the camera . updated review . Although when I first tried DxO i thought it was outstanding , because it made some quick editing easy . However now that I have been using it for a while and have also tried some additional products , I am less thrilled with it . I have realized that it is extremely slow to load up and exit and that although it allows for some quick editing in reality I can do pretty much the same things quicker in elements or Light Room . I also have come to believe that it is extremely over priced priced higher than elements or light room . I have recently started using Light Room and believe it is far superior to DxO .#### #### ####[([58], [158], 'NEU')]

And you thought Windows 8 was n't great . With Windows 10 Microsoft manages to sink even lower . I have never in my life uninstalled an OS so fast before and came running back to Windows 7 . The problems began with just trying to get it on my PC , the clean install simply gave me an error after it downloaded and soon after blue screened my PC . So I installed it to a USB drive and I wanted to give up before I even got to the desktop . It 's like you are signing your life away to microsoft rather than just installing the OS and getting started . Before getting started you need to select custom install and switch off all the default security holes and data mining services put there on purpose . When you get to the desktop you will probably notice how slow it is and how much it locks up . So the only thing to do next to make your computer more usable is to change more default settings deep in the system and uninstall as much of the resource consuming , data mining bloatware as you can after you install all your drivers and such . The start menu is back by default but it 's not the start menu you know and love . It 's more like a mini smart phone interface designed as a start menu . The large , scrolling alphabetical program listing is both ugly and is very annoying to use because of how much scrolling is required and how slow it is . That 's another issue , no matter how much you change your system to make it run faster , Windows 10 is also simply a very laggy and buggy OS . The task bar having the most lock ups or bugs . Sometimes things just do n't work on it at all . Sound also is a major issue , some people lack sound altogether and have n't been able to get it back . Others like me are getting worse sound quality ( less clarity overall , the sound is somewhat muddy ) . So when all is set and done and you get to attempting to use the OS normally you 'll find it 's just a hollow , buggy mess with more security holes than swiss cheese made to steal your data for profit and sell you overpriced garbage you do not want nor need . There seems to be almost no effort put into making the OS better at all , in fact as far as I can see it 's only been made worse .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [255], 'NEG'), ([3, 4], [299], 'NEG'), ([209, 210], [255], 'NEG'), ([209, 210], [351], 'NEG'), ([303, 304], [329], 'NEG'), ([303, 304], [355], 'NEG'), ([303, 304], [363], 'NEG'), ([324], [255], 'NEG'), ([324], [299], 'NEG'), ([324], [329], 'NEG'), ([324], [363], 'NEG'), ([324], [432], 'NEG'), ([356], [255], 'NEG'), ([356], [299], 'NEG'), ([356], [329], 'NEG'), ([356], [351], 'NEG'), ([356], [355], 'NEG'), ([360], [329], 'NEG'), ([360], [363], 'NEG'), ([10, 11], [255], 'NEG'), ([10, 11], [351], 'NEG')]

I actually have been a customer for a number of years and have owned multiple copies and multiple versions . At times Acronis True Image has been a lifesaver. < br /> However , that being said , their customer service has been some of the worst ever . As much money as I have spent with them , the one time I tried to get help , they were useless and essentially turned their back on me. < br /> Furthermore , I really hate the direction they are taking . They talk like they are doing us this great thing in their blurbs , but in reality , it is nothing more than money-grabbing . With the 2015 version they have REMOVED the ability to sync your files to an external hard drive . Yes , you can still back them up , but you can no longer have a live sync . This was very valuable to me in the past . Now , in order to &# 34 ; help &# 34 ; us by &# 34 ; making our data available to us on any device any time &# 34 ; , they are forcing us to subscribe to their Cloud service in order to sync our data . The data I was syncing previously would now cost me $ 239.98 per year to sync in their Cloud . Even if I stripped out what was not essential , it would cost me $ 149.98 per year . I do n't even own a device that would connect to the Cloud to benefit from this &# 34 ; any device - any time &# 34 ; so-called service. < br />< br /> It 's time they get their head out of the &# 34 ; Clouds &# 34 ; and try actually taking care of what their customers want instead of how they can bilk us for more money . I 'm not against anyone making money . But , if you treat your customers right and quit gouging them , they will be loyal and you wo n't have to worry the about money - it will come to you .#### #### ####[([39, 40], [46], 'NEU')]

I can honestly say this has to be the worst so-called upgrade ever . I have been a long time Print Shop user for years , and have done many high quality projects . As I have a new computer and Windows 8 , I was forced to buy this &# 34 ; updgrade &# 34 ; to work with it . This new version has lost so many nice features older versions have had . Cannot import Photoshop files any longer , cannot do photo gradient effects , etc . It is so frustrating , and for the fist time , feel like I really wasted my money . None of my old projects import as designed and you cannot correct them to look the same . This is s waste fo money , waste of time , and unusable unless you are looking to dovery easy projects , with no creativity of you own. < br />< br /> Also the user interface is not user-friendly , and documentation is horrible . It 's too bad , as Print Shop used to be excellent software . As is now , it is like the first version they have made , not an upgrade , but a severe downgrade . Thankfully I still have my old computer , and older version to use for projects . Hoping to find a new software , that does better , and more than this .#### #### ####[([70], [76], 'NEG'), ([78], [76], 'NEG'), ([78], [172], 'NEG'), ([85, 86], [83], 'NEG'), ([85, 86], [172], 'NEG'), ([163, 164], [9], 'NEG'), ([163, 164], [166, 167], 'NEG'), ([170], [76], 'NEG'), ([170], [83], 'NEG'), ([170], [172], 'NEG')]

Microsoft is possibly the worst corporation on the planet . I installed 10 on my computer and it did not take long to see where the company had spent their time . Did they make their &# 34 ; program &# 34 ; easier to use ? Absolutely not , it is worse than windows 7 . You ca n't find anything and none of the programs like Norton do n't work at all . It was a hair pulling job to just get google to show up . 10 tried to take over gmail and the results were terrible . What the program wants you to do is follow the orders of 10 and forget about the rest of the good programs available. < br /> I have been a computer user since 1964 and have been through all of the history of the personal computer and I can say without any reservation that Microsoft is like a thief that takes your money and does very little of what is expected. < br /> This does it for me , I will buy an Apple computer in the near future and be able to relax without spending hours trying to fix the fraud of a machine from Microsoft .#### #### ####[([39], [4], 'NEG'), ([39], [43], 'NEG'), ([39], [52], 'NEG'), ([66], [69, 70], 'NEG')]

I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. < br />< br /> Pros : Windows 10 stops the annoying tendancy of Windows 8 to inexplicably open the right side menu 's over the workspace . It also does n't completely crash forcing a re-start with the power button like Windows 8 ; but at various times every program freezes and you will have to wait ( in some cases for several minutes for the program to work again ) . Windows 10 removed the Windows 8 first layer of app menu ( or incorporated this into the start button ) ; but for some reason there is an initial ( picture ) screen to click through to get to the logon screen . So there is one less screen to get to the PC desktop < br />< br /> Cons : MicroSoft has really gone over the top on collecting your personal data for marketing purposes and to re-sell it to others . This operating system is completely invasive and they have out-done Google with the extent of this data capture which is both on-line and off-line . Basically everything you do on your computer is now captured by MicroSoft . You can limit some of this by NOT accepting the default settings when you first install this ; but it 's very difficult . The button to manually setup is a small font text on the left hand side . Once set-up , Windows 10 seems to be incompatible with virtually every program including MicroSoft 's own applications . OneNote , which was unstable on Windows 7 & 8 is completely unusable . Everything runs slower . Every browser , especially MS Edge has trouble loading pages. < br />< br /> I 'm not sure why anyone would buy this .#### #### ####[([22, 23], [19], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], [274], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], [287], 'NEG')]
What a treat ! I am a recipe collector of major league proportion and I have never found a way to organize them that has satisfied me .

I purchased the desktop version of this software and had an expert install the program . I gave this software a generous 1 star because they falsely tell you that you have 30 days of software support . I was having difficulty with the Chart of Accounts and called support . An automated system started asking me to pick an age category by choosing option 1 or 2 . When I refused to answer by not choosing either option offered , I was disconnected . I still needed the help so I called back and bit the bullet choosing randomly that I was over 65 . I was immediately met with advertising for that age group and forced to take a survey that I did not want to participate in . Due to the fact that I just spent over $ 180.00 for the program I had no choice but to take the survey if I wanted help . When a representative finally came on the line I explained my problem and he asked to gain access to my computer to see if he could resolve the issue . When he also ran into errors he told me that the program was installed incorrectly . This was not true as it was installed step by step according to the instructions and done by a technical support manager with no problems . To make matters even worse , the rep told me that since &# 34 ; they &# 34 ; did n't install it , I now had to purchase a support program for $ 300.00 !! ! WHAT ?! ! I remarked that it does not state this anywhere in the packaging or a disclaimer . I suggested uninstalling it and having them reinstall it again and he told me without any explanation that they would not do that . Furthermore he got a supervisor who told me that it was normal to be expected to &# 34 ; buy &# 34 ; additional support and stated he that I should have expected that . So the 30 day free support they advertise is non existent . Intuit flat out lied about their support , huckstered you into giving them personal information so they can market other products and sell your information to other companies . Save yourself the headache and DO NOT BUY Intuit products . I never will again and am returning this product ! and am returning this product !#### #### ####[([200], [203], 'NEG'), ([200], [356], 'NEG'), ([200], [361], 'NEG')]

We have had a cookbook on the computer for many years that is no longer supported so when searching for a replacement one big criteria was the ability to customize or add a personal cookbook . It does not get any better than Cook'n . We exported the old data base as a . txt file and then imported each recipe to the new custom cookbook using the excellent built in tools . We had over 600 recipes in our old system and it only took one day to recreate it . We synced with Cook'n website and have the cookbook on Android Cell phones and a Windows 10 Tablet . What a great product . When installing on the Windows 10 tablet I had file error and I emailed the DVO tech support and quickly received a detailed step by step procedure to fix the error .

I purchased this software after doing extended review and selected it as the best . I purchased it to do a simple task to reduce a large volume of family history into text . Nothing else . When installed I keep getting the message for better results to synchronize with all my accounts . Since I did not it to work on all my email , web searching Microsoft office programs and others I would not do that . Maybe it would have improved my profile but I do n't think this is the purpose of this.I have worked with computers for over fifty years . I consider this program has spyware and here is my reason for the thinking . When installing it pinned a program to my start up to activate a manage your account program which went on line every time you sign on and does more than check for updates . I do n't like background programs running on my computer that I ca n't find out what they are doing . You cant disable this program but can exit it but it will come back the next time you start up . I decided to uninstall the program buy the standard procedure but only got the main dragon program listed in my list of programs . I tried to click on and hit the uninstall instructions . Got message location of program not found and to check name and location . after two try went online and goggled how to uninstall Dragon and one writer pointed me to the Nuance web site and told me how to do it . To uninstall you must reload the CD and activate the setup and somewhere select remove . I have no fault with how well the program works . It does a great job but I think the program is trying to hang onto the user and monitor his activities ever time you sign on . Program should give you the option to disable this function and only notify you when updates are available . I do n't want to be online with anybody except when I choose to do so. and for what I was doing it isnt necesary . If you want them to monitor all your accounts and spy on you maybe it is ok . But I think the main reason they keep hounding you to register is somewhere in the agreement you are giving the permission to do this .#### #### ####[([85], [83], 'NEU'), ([109], [111], 'NEU'), ([299], [83], 'NEU')]
Set up is a bit of a hassle , as you will need to verify your product key through Image Line by downloading another tool. < br />< br /> This is not why I give it 3 stars though . I wish I had instead bought the producer edition of this software , as I quickly realized many features I wanted to use I do n't have access to in the fruity edition. < br />< br /> Other than that , works as it should. < br />< br /> Other thoughts : I would advise having a modern PC ( 2013 build or later ) as it will eat resources , and function better on a newer or more powerful machine .

This was hard to install because I did not follow the directions correctly the first time ! But the online help is excellent ; they were even able to take over my computer and correct the installation for me . I already know quite a bit of Spanish and have not yet figured out how to start on Level 2 , but the Level 1 games and activities are mildly interesting and I think would be very good if I did n't already know Spanish . You do have to actively think to succeed -- using what you have learned in the past few activities to accomplish each task. < br />< br /> The ' microphone ' and headphones are nearly worthless ; the microphone boom is too short and the microphone itself is not very sensitive . I had a hard time getting the program to acknowledge and / or accept my pronunciations even though I know they were good .

This is the third cookbook product I have used in the past 10 years . This product has been far soupier to other products I have used . it does everything I need to do with my personal recipes . The ability to capture recipes from a WEB site is great. with some of the other products I used you had to download the recipe from the WEB and then cut and paste it into the cookbook product . The support for the product is also great . I just updated to Windows 10 and had a problem with Cook'n starting . I sent the problem off to the support team along with the log file and support was able to resolve this issue in less than 24 hours . Cook'n is running under Windows 10 fine at this time . I recently had a problem with my old computer and I lose all of my applications . I contacted DVO support with my issue and they sent me a link to re-download the product for my new machine .

Being able to type fast , efficient and with minimum mistakes is very important in today ’s society . That ’s why I decided to make sure that all 3 of my kids can type using the blind typing method . This software is great for it ! My kids have tried it for a few days and they really enjoy it . Even though it seems a little outdated , it still gets the job done . You can have more than one student at the same time and they do n’t have to share their profiles . Each of them can learn at their own pace . This software even has typing games as a reward while still helping them to learn how to type . I find it important to remind kids to actually use the correct fingers and not to ‘ peck’ with two fingers just to get a better result in a game .

it 's a good concept but completely unreliable . It came as part of Office 2013 ( although you can download it for free now ) . The problem is with the sync . Although MicroSoft claims that this can be used with all devisces , the data needs to be downloaded to each device every time you use it ( which can take over an hour with large files ) . Worse still , it constantly crashes no matter what OS is used , in fact it 's even worse on Windows 10 ( I have a Win7 PC , and a Win8.1 PC which I just upgraded to Win10 , and a Galaxy S5 smartphone running on Android Lollipop ) .#### #### ####[([32], [90], 'NEG'), ([32], [28], 'NEG'), ([92, 93], [90], 'NEG'), ([92, 93], [28], 'NEG')]

I got this pc game for my 10 year old daughter who struggled with math all of this past school year . When I saw it , I was excited because she 's crazy about dragons and I was hopeful this would help ease her into the game and help her learn easier . She tends to be stubborn , like her mother :) , so I knew this would be the perfect way to help her with her math problems , and allow her to have fun at the same time . We run the game on our desktop computer for her , which runs on Windows 8 . It installed easily and quickly , with no isses encountered . My favorite feature is that this game is for grades 3 through 8 , making it perfect for not only my 10 year old daughter , but my 13 year old son as well . The game itself is the perfect balance of learning , and fun , which is exactly what my daughter was needing . I 've watched her conquer all of the problems she was having last year , all the while with a smile on her face and having fun . To me , that is priceless . I was so very fortunante to receive this item at a discount,in exchange for my honest review , and I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to spark a love for learning in their child !#### #### ####[([157], [161], 'POS'), ([107, 108], [161], 'POS'), ([107, 108], [112], 'POS')]

It is better that Windows 8. * but really I 'm not sure about privacy , it look like Windows 8.1 morphed to look like windows 7 , they try to introduce a cellphone OS into a desktop , but it do n't feel good . About the screen presentation aspect , it look flat as windows 8. * getting a cheap look too , we are coming from any previous windows with a 3D look at the GUI and now they send us back to end of the 80 's with a flat look like windows 1 or 2 , come on !!! from windows 3.1 we have a 3D look !!!! , is like to migrate from a 3D HD TV to a BW TV !!! ! In my opinion and my advice to my costumers , keep on Windows 7 as long you can , Windows 10 is a &# 34 ; good job &# 34 ; for Microsoft , try again ... My advice to Microsoft , remember a desktop is not a phone , the look is very important , remember 3D and do n't look cheap ; I do n't need to talk with it , we are not at Star Trek yet and the professionals we do n't talk with our computers we write on it .

My advise , if you want to update your computer please make a Backup first !!! ! Update ( 11-15-2015 ) : I have some computer running fine Windows 10 Pro , but yesterday some of them stating the update to version 1511 , but the problem started again , the 83-33 of the dead came again but this time just updating Windows 10 itself . With this Windows 10 reliability is in troubles again from my point of view , because just with an update now I have a lot of inoperative computers in my business .#### #### ####[([48, 49], [384], 'NEG'), ([180], [183], 'NEG'), ([289, 290], [384], 'NEG')]

Do NOT buy this if you have installed Windows 10 !!!!!!!< br />< br /> I have tried to install it several times since upgrading to Windows 10 , but hit an error midway through that stops the installation every time . I contacted Nero tech support , and they said that the 2015 versions are not supported for Windows 10 . Their software will not be supported for Windows 10 until the 2016 versions come out later this year. < br />< br /> I installed the most recent version of Roxio Easy CD & DVD burning software , with not problems . So go with that if you need burner software for Windows 10 ( which is sad , because , in my experience , Nero is a better product if it works ).< br />< br /> Sadly , I bought this several months ago , so it 's too late to return it . $$$ down the toilet , and Nero has lost a long-time customer .#### #### ####[([59, 60], [56, 57], 'NEG'), ([59, 60], [102], 'NEG'), ([63], [56, 57], 'NEG')]

This is a good product that works as advertised . There has been several bad reviews but I think if you understand what the product is going to do it will be good experience. < br />< br /> The product will take over ( hijack ) your sound card . It does this to make sound capturing as easy as possible and to allow you to capture gaming songs , but it means your speaker / headphones jack is n't going to work anymore . The hardware has a Line Out on the back but the signal is very &# 34 ; hot &# 34 ; for headphones , so you have to turn the volume way down. < br />< br /> That 's the worst of it . If you can get past that , the product is full of good tools to help you turn your LPs , cassettes , or in my case , reel to reels into MP3s . My suggestion is to get all the LPs you want transferred done at once , then uninstall the product .#### #### ####[([48, 49], [103], 'POS'), ([97], [103], 'POS')]

I find it really annoying that I have to plug all my drives in at once at least once a month in order to maintain backups . First of all , when I get automated warnings about &# 34 ; It 's been 14 days since you 've backed up &# 34 ; , they do n't tell me which drive to plug in . In fact it 's not possible for me to plug in all my drives at once because some of them have old connectors . Then when I do plug them in , it takes all night ( or longer ) for Backblaze to figure out what to back up , even if I have n't made changes to the drives . But worst of all is the need to plug them all in at once within a month . I work away from home for over six months at a time , and I do n't bring all my drives with me . So it 's my understanding that they will delete any backups for drives that are not plugged in during these away times . It 's not adequate for them to say that I can plug my computer in with all the drives attached and close it while I 'm away -- I need to use my computer when I 'm working on location even though I do n't need all my drives !< br />< br /> When I signed up for the service I was under the impression that Backblaze is a pro-grade product , but this does n't seem to be the case . It has turned into an enormous headache for me with no end in sight . Will they ever let me simply back a drive up and only pull it off the shelf when I need it ? I 'm tired of this .#### #### ####[([87], [86], 'NEG'), ([87], [4], 'NEG'), ([87], [127], 'NEG'), ([87], [193, 194], 'NEG'), ([87], [280], 'NEG')]

If you take the time to go through the tutorial , speak clearly , and learn the prompts , it is a wonderful program . The person using it is not computer literate and he was able to use the program with minimum computer knowledge .

The problems are part of their marketing strategy . Every year they add &# 34 ; bullet features &# 34 ; to entice people to upgrade . These features add bugs , which they do n't fix - ever . Once they fail to fix a bug one year it has NO chance of getting fixed in a subsequent year . This is corporate bean counter culture at its worst . The cardinal rule of software development is to retain STABILITY before you try to add features - and test the features you add thoroughly before release . This company follows the cardinal rule of quarterly profits - generate immediate income - product be damned - public be damned - company 's long term brand be damned . I bought Finale 1.0 in 1989 and every upgrade until Finale 2011 . I worked for many years as a QA Engineer in Silicon Valley . My advice is to find a used version of Finale 2008 - it 's reasonably stable and its bugs can be worked around . Beyond that , you 'll have terrible problems with audio engines , graphic export , lyrics , document corruption ... on and on . I still prefer F2008 to any of the competitors , sadly . Finale could have been great if they had n't let the money counters destroy their integrity ... sadly ... sadly ... sadly .#### #### ####[([91], [30], 'NEG'), ([190, 191], [30], 'NEG'), ([190, 191], [69], 'NEG'), ([190, 191], [126], 'NEG'), ([190, 191], [184, 185], 'NEG'), ([187, 188], [30], 'NEG'), ([187, 188], [69], 'NEG'), ([187, 188], [126], 'NEG'), ([187, 188], [184, 185], 'NEG')]

Love this software and software support . They are constantly upgrading and adding new features . I have had this software since version 8 , now on 11 . I have been a collector of recipes and cookbooks for years and this software lets me create my own favorite cookbook , and create family cookbooks , add photos and themes to the cookbooks . The nutritional , shopping lists , and menu plans are awesome . They also release new cookbooks monthly so it is great to be able add these also . The newsletter is great and features videos ( did I say you can add videos too ).< br /> Probably one of the greatest things is if you are looking for a recipe on the web you can add it to your cookn from the web with a click of the button . I have the pc version , but they also mobile / android versions and synching to a cloud service so you ca n't loose your recipes .

A few days ago I decided to upgrade to Cook’n 11 from Version 10 . ( I have been using Cook’n since version 8 which I bought in 2011 ) . Something went wrong during the conversion and as a result I could not open Version 11 . I contacted the DVO support group and they have been very prompt in their replies and suggestions . I still had versions 9 and 10 on my computer at the time I installed Version 11 . My problems have all been worked out now and because I had previously exported my various cookbooks I was able to import them into Version 11 with a new install . I did n’t lose much at all just a few new recipes in my personal cookbook that can be put back in. < br />< br /> Last night I started playing with Version 11 and I am absolutely thrilled with it . I thought Version 10 was good but Version 11 totally blows it away . Using the new Snip-It Import Tool I have been able to get recipes I had saved in Evernote into Cook’n and using my scanner I was able to add back the printed copies I had of the few that I lost during the initial install . Tonight I pulled out some old recipes my Mom had clipped out of various newspapers . Some are dated 1986 and 1987 and the pages have somewhat yellowed with age . I scanned these into my computer and then used the Snip-It tool and was able to get the recipes into Cook’n with just minor cleanup where creases or age of the paper interfered slightly with the OCR software . It beats the heck out of typing all this stuff in. < br />< br /> There are three ways to use Snip-It ; using a scanner , clipping from a web page or using clipboard . I have used all three methods . I LOVE VERSION 11 . ( The Capture tool is also still in Version 11 ) This is in my opinion the best Cook Book software out there and besides being so convenient this new version is so MUCH FUN . I have used Google image search to find pictures for some of the recipes that I originally printed but that when scanned did n't bring in the picture. < br />< br /> Like I said earlier in this review , I have used 4 versions now and whenever I have had a problem the DVO support team has done their best to help me sort it out. < br />< br /> I am very happy with the support from the DVO team and with the new Version 11. < br />< br /> I rate the software and support 5 out of 5 STARS. < br />< br /> Nina Irwin#### #### ####[([242], [245], 'POS'), ([242], [354], 'POS'), ([242], [449], 'POS'), ([285, 286], [281], 'POS')]

This version is very easy to use , and does everything an average user might want to do ... except actually render a video project to a file or DVD . This product crashes 100 % of the time for me when trying to render , but at least it helpfully creates a dump file and instructs you to contact technical support . Unfortunately , Corel technical support no longer supports this product via phone or email since &# 34 ; Because the computing environment changes so quickly , it ’s very difficult for us to maintain older versions of software ...&# 34 ; Which is understandable since this version came out almost two whole years ago -- that 's an awful long time for a poor little software company to have to keep track of why their product does n't work . Note that I only discovered that this product was no longer supported after I opened a case ... for having difficulties registering the product in the first place . Helpfully , you cannot request the support ( that no longer exists ) until you register the product . Which also does n't work. < br />< br /> This product may have been great for the two or three weeks that the vendor may have supported it . And I know that it 's now at least two versions behind . But I seriously doubt that I would purchase any other products from this firm now that I 've discovered ( the hard way ) just how fleeting and poor their product support is . If you choose to buy this version ( which is still offered for sale by Amazon ) know at least that you will be out of support the moment you purchase it .#### #### ####[([6], [4], 'NEG')]

I acquired CS2 a while back , mostly for the full-version of Photoshop which is part of it ; I 'm an Elements user but there are features in even an obsolete version of Photoshop that Elements just does n't have and probably never will . Illustrator is also part of CS2 but I have no background at all in it . I found this course strictly by chance and bought it immediately for a very good price . The GUI was pretty clunky but I was able to get all the relevant video files off the DVD and put them into an easily-accessed file on my hard disk . I now have an excellent introduction to all of Illustrator 's features and can learn something about it ; it certainly does n't hurt to learn something you did n't know about before .#### #### ####[([77], [76], 'POS')]

I was unable to get the software to fully function on my computer . It would not allow me to populate the spreadsheet numbers or line descriptions . I spoke to support on 3 occasions . They said the software was fine but it was a conflict with another program . Their fix was to stop all programs running in the background . I did this and it still would n't work and crashed every time I tried to populate the spreadsheets . Support told me it was a Microsoft issue and they could not help . I did download the software onto a second computer ( my biz partner ) and it worked fine on his computer . ( You get 2 downloads if you want ) . A very poor response from Palo Alto Tech in my view but I have hours already in this so I have to make it work . I am having a tech look at my CPU to see if it can be fixed . I think the software would be pretty good if I did n't have this bug . Funny I have scores of other routine programs that do n't seem to conflict with each other .

Windows 10 boasts having the best features of everything since Windows 7 . There 's no way to do anything on the Net but run a search for one site . When you 're done with it , you log off and that 's it . If you want to move to another site , fuggeddaboudit ! You have to run a separate search for it . So there 's no more moving from one favorite to another , because your toolbar on top is gone . To paraphrase the Rolling Stones ; &# 34 ; Because I used to surf thuh Internet ... But it 's all ovah now &# 34 ; . I guess the only upside to this browser is that it does n't take forever to open certain pages that have a lot of link panels on them like my old Explorer did . But maybe that 's because my edition of it may have been out of date . Speaking of music , the new &# 34 ; Groove Music &# 34 ; has no way of ripping CDs onto your drive , no way of synching playlists onto your MP3 player . Fortunately my Windows 10 let me keep my old WMP , but it forgot all my tunes and has been slo-o-o-owly reloading them since yesterday . That 's well over 24 hours and it only got as far as it has because I left my comp on with WMP open all night -- just shut off the screen . Plus it forgot all my playlists . Plus it looks like my screen saver survived . I 've been too busy struggling with this other stuff to find out how well that works . Okay , we got a lot of gee-whiz tech junkies on here who consider anything but joyful enthusiasm about Windows 10 as Luddism and hatemongering . As for me , maybe I should be thankful that mine was a freebie download and I did n't have to buy it . But I wish I could get my Windows 7 back without paying an arm and a leg .#### #### ####[([6], [5], 'NEG'), ([81], [85], 'NEG'), ([81], [179], 'NEG'), ([81], [188], 'NEG'), ([81], [259], 'NEG')]

I 've had this program for many years and have seen it &# 34 ; grow &# 34 ; through a lot of upgrades .

Had a little trouble with the sound not coming through , every other tape . Had to keep rebooting to fix that problem , but we think it may have been associated with the cabling . My VCR does not have all 3 connectors ( not stereo ) , so that may have caused some confusion in the connection . The process is a bit tedious for lots of tapes because it runs real-time . The most disappointing thing is that by reading the description on Amazon it leads you to believe you can burn DVDs with this software . You cannot . You have to take the converted copies it created and then process it from there using something else . In my case , I do n't have iDVD or bundled DVD burner , so I have to find yet more software to do that because I want to view the movies on a standard DVD player for TV , not huddle around my Mac . On the plus side , for a reasonable cost I now have all 20 VHS home videos safely converted to digital and stored in my Mac . That was the biggest hurdle of all since having it done professionally would have cost far more .#### #### ####[([6], [7, 8], 'NEU'), ([6], [65], 'NEU'), ([34], [39], 'NEU'), ([34], [65], 'NEU'), ([43], [39], 'NEU')]

I really like this recipe organizer , but I would n't say it is perfect or the only thing you would ever need . I do however think it is great for people who need help staying organized , making grocery lists , meal planning , etc . I have used all the function on on the software and the only complaint I have is the difficulty scanning recipes . It could be because my scanner is n't great or maybe I just need a little practice , but I find it quicker to just type the recipe in then mess with trying to scan it . I bought this for my mother as well , but she has n't really used it yet . She was really excited about the concept. < br />< br /> They do ask for lots of customer feedback and make improvements based on that feedback , which is n't something you see many companies do , so in future updates I may have to add to my review .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [61], 'POS'), ([75], [61], 'POS')]

I have been using MM since 2000 ( came with the purchase of a new tower ) . I updated it possibly two or three times , but other than that I used it the way I got it until 2014 . Last year I had to get Money Plus , do n't really notice much change . But I still like it compared to Quicken , whose updates you have to purchase . Now the problem comes , Money Plus will not work on Windows 10 systems . Because I did n't know that I updated to 10 and found out the hard way . Because there is no reasonable alternative program I had to revert back to Windows 7 . I do not know if Quicken will function with Windows 10 or not . I have not been able to verify any programs that will work with Windows 10 .

I have been using Snow Leopard on an early 2008 Mac Pro Tower computer for several years now . It is the BEST , fastest , most dependable , most reliable computing thing I have EVER laid hands on. < br />< br /> MY HISTORY < br /> I bought my first Mac in 1993 . Have owned many different models , including an LCIII , G3 Desktop , an eMac , the very first iMac , an iMac G5 , a PowerBook G4 , this Mac Pro Tower , and I have used Windows computers in offices I have worked in . I have also helped friends with their Macs and other friends with their Windows computers . I have also tried later versions of Macintosh Operating Systems including Mountain Lion and Mavericks. < br />< br /> So given my history , I should know something of what I am talking about , and I can guarantee that Snow Leopard is the BEST. < br />< br /> I really liked Tiger a lot , but it does n't run on Intels . Leopard was apparently a bloated mess that ran very slow . Versions after Snow Leopard are missing very useful features ... But Snow Leopard is a Lean , Clean , Stream Lined , Fast , Powerful , Reliable Beauty with all the features I have ever wanted or needed. < br />< br /> The first two things I noticed MISSING with versions of the Macintosh Operating System after Snow Leopard :< br />< br /> 1 . You can no longer simply double click on a folder to see the contents in a new window . You have to Option Double Click or something . This is ridiculous . The ability to EASILY : Create folders , name and rename folders , and organize my stuff into folders by dragging files and folders into other folders ... is the NUMBER ONE REASON THAT I HAVE LOVED USING MACS SINCE 1993. < br />< br /> 2 . The Show All Bookmarks page is gone from Safari in later Mac OS Versions . I do NOT use TABs . I WILL NOT use Tabs . I REFUSE to use Tabs . Every time I open Safari in Snow Leopard , my Bookmarks page is right there waiting for me to choose something I refer to all the time . Most of my Bookmarks are organized into folders all named appropriately , and though I am behind in putting Bookmarks from the New Bookmarks list into the appropriate folders , I can still find what I am looking for very quickly . But with NO Bookmarks Page in subsequent versions of the Mac OS , it would be IMPOSSIBLE for me to use BOOKMARKS ANY MORE. < br />< br /> 3 . I have just read that in the latest version of the Mac OS , there are even MORE things missing that people used all the time , like :< br /> a . No Geotracking in iPhoto , because iPhoto is GONE , and some CHEAP replacement called simply Photo has taken its place. < br /> b . You cannot stop your computer from answering calls to your iPhone , and you cannot stop your phone from getting messages sent to your computer. < br />< br /> Resizing albums in iTunes was also removed last year . And as a side note , the new Music App for iPhones is completely useless in every way. < br />< br /> I know this is a short list . There 's a lot more things that others are complaining about , but THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME AND OTHERS . Like I said , I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL MACINTOSH USER SINCE 1993 BECAUSE OF THESE FEATURES . So APPLE PLEASE RESTORE THESE FEATURES TO THE LATEST OPERATING SYSTEM , OR RESTORE SUPPORT FOR SNOW LEOPARD !< br />< br /> Thank You ! ! A very disappointed Apple Fan.he appropriate folders , I can still find what I am looking for very quickly .

I too am one of those unlucky ones who spent HOURS trying to get this to install on my computer . I am a HUGE Norton fan , use their Norton 360 for some of my computers ; but was thrilled that this one would go on my phone and additional computers . It was a huge disappointment . I spent hours on the phone with customer service , only for them to call a couple weeks later and say they had fixed the kinks in it ... but it still had the same issues . I honestly never tried again after that ; who needs this ? I do have it on my android cell phone and it seems good but nothing fancy . Meh .

Windows 10 is definitely worth the upgrade . It is better than Windows 7 in everyway . I will tell you why :< br />< br /> Fast booting time :< br /> My computer has never booted this fast . Windows 10 loads up almost instantly , apps load up in milliseconds . Even win 8 was n't this fast , sometimes I wonder if my pc is overclocking. < br />< br /> Start menu :< br /> The start menu is new and improved . You can now search for apps alphabetically . The search bar returns , you can search for files and apps and even search the web ( which can be turned off by the way ) . The tiles are completely customizable meaning that you can put whatever app or program on it and take off the ones you do n't want . Those who complain about it are simply too intransigent and just want windows too stay the same. < br />< br /> Multiple Desktops :< br /> This is n't anything new to operating systems but I 'm certainly glad windows decided to make it easy and useful . All you have to do is hit the windows + tab key then you have the option to create a new virtual desktop. < br />< br /> I am barely scratching the surface with this review , all I 'm saying here is do n't fully believe the negative hype about windows 10 . Yea sure , windows 10 does have its flaws but I am not blind . I know a great operating system when I see one . Give it a chance and if you do n't like it you can go back to windows 7 . I 'm pretty sure a few years from now , the people that are hating windows 10 now will have windows 10 on their computers in the future .#### #### ####[([125], [128], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [10], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [27], 'POS')]

The software will turn an old xp into a new windows 7 but you must have the ram and other few requirements like 1GB of ram memory .

Office 2013 is a relatively easy program to setup and use. < br />< br /> The product downloads the necessary files and installed them once you have followed the instructions . Typically this is about 10 minutes on a 10MB internet connection. < br />< br /> If you change computer , you can take the license with you . Just remove from the old device and install on the new one . There is no limit to the machine you move the software to , but it can only be installed on one. < br />< br /> I think Office 2013 Home and Business is a great step forward , and having the software associated with a Microsoft Account means you do n't have to keep DVD 's of software in a safe place , all you need is an internet connection and the login details ( you can always reset these if you forget your password too ) .#### #### ####[([6], [109], 'POS'), ([6], [5], 'POS')]

So many mixed reviews I have read on this item . Here is my honest assessment of it both good and bad . Nova makes this for Hallmark , back in 2005 it was made by Sierra and came with 3 discs , this product has only 1 disc . Sierra was a much better software developer than Nova is. < br />< br /> I wish my old 2005 version that I had on my XP computer would run on my Windows 7 computer , but it wo n't . That is why I bought this one . I read a lot of install problem reviews on this product , if you were paying attention - it states by default it is set up to install on Windows 7 - My install on Windows 7 went as good as good can be and it installed in just 16 minutes , there are a ( Lot ) of files that need to be copied and installed . Then I did the update and patch download , which went very well . My guess is that for some people they are not patient enough to let this thing load . For some other people Windows 8 might be their problem and , and the install may have to be configured a bit differently . Some might not even be reading all of the instructions , thinking they know what to do so why bother . Read everything first with any program you install . And ( Close ) all of your other open programs during this install - Basic computer 101 rules need to be followed . Make sure your computer has ( Plenty of available RAM and hard drive space ).< br />< br /> Overall it 's OK - Not as good as earlier versions , but it will make OK cards etc for you . After the install I created a card and inserted my own pictures etc. and it came out OK - It found my wireless printer with no problem . One thing I found out was , my HP wireless All In One Printer does not like the heavy card stock . I had a jam on my first try , but that can happen and it did ! - I find I must kind of help the card stock along by giving a gentle push on the card stock as it is loading into the printer . I only make cards etc . for birthdays , holidays , and special occasions . So this will work for me . But my old 2005 version was vastly betterthan this version . It 's not a 5 star so I gave it a 4 star rating , overall it'a an OK program .#### #### ####[([55, 56], [54], 'POS'), ([55, 56], [282], 'POS'), ([203, 204], [363], 'POS'), ([287, 288], [363], 'POS'), ([364, 365], [363], 'POS'), ([285], [282], 'POS')]

Very nice price for this 2007 full version of Microsoft Office Professional 2007 . I believe the price from Microsoft would have been around $ 400 or so . I use Windows 7 , and this fits the bill beautifully . I bought this mainly for Outlook and Word , which would have cost more to have bought the new versions .

The box and the description clearly said and showed a picture of a printed Companion guide . There is not . It is an on line feature of the software itself .

This sure seems like a lazy software company , taking years to get out each new version -- and staying so wildly behind current advances in technology it 's silly . I guess if you 're the industry leader , you do n't have to do much to charge people an upgrade fee . The competing software FADE IN and MOVIE MAGIC are okay , ahead in some features and behind in others , but at least they 're designing for this millennium . ADOBE STORY is interesting , but slow and makes you keep your writing on their server where they can charge you for access . HIGHLAND and WRITERDUET are also pretty interesting and I 'm considering the switch . I 've been reluctantly using FINAL DRAFT for almost 20 years , although I find SCRIVENER easiest to use for almost all of my outlining and drafting . I 'd wait for FINAL DRAFT 10 if I were you -- although it could again be years before it comes out and is still way behind the times . Hopefully , SCRIVENER will come out with an iPad version in early 2016 or the other software contenders ( including CELTX ) will give FINAL DRAFT a run for its money or send it out to pasture .#### #### ####[([84, 85], [138], 'NEG'), ([84, 85], [65], 'NEG'), ([84, 85], [87], 'NEG'), ([84, 85], [114], 'NEG'), ([84, 85], [176], 'NEG')]

Parallels is great ! I bought it so that I could use different operating systems on my Mac . I was able to get Chrome OS , Windows 10 Insider Preview ( months before the public release ) , and OSX El Capitan to run well . I will say , however , if you do not have sufficient RAM on your computer , some of the more advanced programs will not work well . I partitioned the ram on my computer to allow 16GB for Windows 10 , and it worked excessively well . I have been gaming on Steam , and it works flawlessly . Once you go into full screen mode , you would think you were running the computer 's native software .

I tried Windows 10 this past week . And It installed ok . Seemed like a decent OS but it did seem a little less responsive than windows 7 . And it seems to take just that little bit longer to get to where you want to go in the start menu . For example there are two different places where you have to go to change settings . There is the settings menu and then there is the control panel that we all know . The windows 7 layout is faster and all your setting are in the control panel. < br />< br /> By far one of the worst things about windows 10 is the fact that you ca n't disable windows update . If you work on your computer all day you ca n't have the computer updating itself while you are doing important work on the computer . So hopefully Microsoft will change this in a future update . Because I wo n't be able to use this OS on work computers until that is changed .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [91], 'NEU'), ([2, 3], [111], 'NEU'), ([17], [16], 'NEU'), ([72, 73], [91], 'NEU'), ([72, 73], [39], 'NEU'), ([72, 73], [111], 'NEU'), ([79, 80], [39], 'NEU'), ([79, 80], [111], 'NEU'), ([87, 88], [91], 'NEU'), ([87, 88], [111], 'NEU')]

This has been the best purchase I have ever made . I have a power mac with 16 GB of memory ... it freaks my friends out that I can run windows and mac programs simultaneously on the same computer and the windows programs are morphed into the Mac 's friendly look and feel . I am an avid Genealogist and use a family tree software only available for the PC. < br />< br /> Parallels gives you a program that will image the files off of an older PC and let you migrate them to your mac .

As a Mac user , I 've been sitting on the sideline regarding Office365 until they released the new Office for Mac ( Office 2016 ).< br />< br /> After using the Office 2016 beta for months ( without any licensing errors ... I wonder how long I could have kept using it ) , I 'm noticing a number of improvements that come along with the Office 365 subscription . Hassle-free , full-featured installs on a to of devices ? Check . Seamless dropbox integration across all devices ? Check . I 've got zero buyer 's remorse over 30 days in. < br />< br /> Everyone will decide for themselves if they want to make the leap to Office 365 , but if you are ... why would n't you take the 20-30 % discount by ordering the subscription this way ?#### #### ####[([85, 86], [84], 'POS')]

I 'm only using Dragon Dictate to generate speaker notes , so my requirements for the software are pretty minimal and it seems to be meeting them . However , every single step of the customer experience has been HORRIBLE . The download crashed my browser . When I tried to restart the download , their portal claimed multiple times that I had exceeded my number of downloads . Ten minutes on their website to find how to contact customer service . Thirty six hours for them to respond and reset so I could download . Then the serial number did n't work ; I tried five or six times ; another email to customer service . Wanting to try the software , I accepted the offered trial use and spent the requisite 15 minutes to train it to my voice . I worked with it over the weekend and it worked pretty well . I ca n't find a way to quit the software other than through Activity Monitor . Today , for no apparent reason , the same serial number finally works . I tried to use the software again only to discover that it 's thrown away the profile I created over the weekend . When I called customer service , they claimed the problem was that I did n't have a USB microphone . After explaining for the third time that I 'd tested the software with the headset from my iPhone and it worked fine , I finally got him to admit that I was going to start over training the software because the trial use does n't save your profile . This was supposed to make the speaker notes task faster , but so far the ROI is negative from all the time I 've wasted trying to get the software running .#### #### ####[([16], [43], 'NEG'), ([16], [249], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [39], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [153], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [249], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [286], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [294], 'NEG')]

I have used BibleWorks for many years in my research and writing and was looking forward to this latest update . The BW people have not disappointed . As an Old Testament scholar , I often was jealous of my New Testament counterparts that used previous versions , since the tools for Hebrew and Old Testament textual criticism were lacking or missing from those . However , with this new version , much more is available for Old Testament scholars . These include :< br /> 1 . Images of Codex Leningradensis < br /> 2 . The now available Stuttgart Original Languages module as an add-on -- this includes the BHS apparatus and in an update will include the BHQ text critical apparatus < br /> 3 . fuzzy searches that enable one to find similar words / phrases -- I have found this often helps me discover parallel language in other parts of the OT < br /> 4 . The full text of the New English Translation of the Septuagint -- much better than the old Breton Septuagint < br /> 5 . Better integration of the Samaritan Pentateuch -- one can now view SP text alongside MT !< br /> 6 . The Leiden Old Testament Peshitta is now included. < br />< br /> In addition , BibleWorks 10 has other features that are quite useful :< br /> 1 . One can integrate e-published books into BW 10 for easy access to any reference works from other publishers < br /> 2 . An entire library of Holy Land photos -- a great resource that enables me to include these in presentations for my classes < br /> 3 . The ESV Concise Bible Atlas -- and one can purchase the entire ESV atlas as an additional module -- again , this is nice for classes , as I can easily access maps to include in my lectures < br /> 4 . While BW 10 maintains the classic 4-column layout , it is no possible to close columns . I often like to work with three columns , so this is a great feature. < br />< br /> Overall , I believe BibleWorks continues to be the best available Bible software for anyone working with ancient languages .#### #### ####[([226], [186], 'POS'), ([226], [230], 'POS')]

After several hours using Windows 10 , I am switching back to Windows 7. < br /> Virtually all of the new features are designed to either steal your private data or charge for something. < br /> There 's no way to turn off the appearance of the Windows Store , One Drive , or Cortana , all of which are disabled if you do n't agree to providing Microsoft with &# 34 ; royalty free &# 34 ; lifetime rights to all of your private data .

Fantastic maturation of Windows ... fast and responsive plus the inclusion of much longed-for start menu. < br />< br /> My quibbles center around how Microsoft seems to view privacy in the last few years , which they seem happy to slowly erode . Just take a trip to Privacy in Settings and see what 's up for grabs. < br />< br /> By default , windows tracks everything you do and type and assigns your Microsoft account an &# 34 ; advertising ID &# 34 ; so it can send you personalized ads while you , for examplr , play solitaire ( never has this been done before ) or use its Edge browser. < br />< br /> Even after that and the rest of the &# 34 ; privacy &# 34 ; section , there are unnerving forced updates and the fact that your Internet connection is used to upload updates to other users ( not good in a time when some ISPs are trying out data caps in some places ) . Also , to use Cortana a Microsoft Account is required ( with its own built in tracking , email mining and advertising ) and even then , Cortana plays pretty fast and loose with your data standalone , requiring everything from location to who you interact with - and how long - to function. < br />< br /> I 'm also glad to see a version of windows that has been put together so aptly and can compete with the best of what Apple or anyone else has to offer . I am , however , very disappointed that privacy is the price I paid , we will all pay , for &# 34 ; free &# 34 ; as we hover away from buying software and instead using it as a service or subscription . I understand that we 're facing a cloud connected future where things are changing , but privacy does n't have to be the price of it .#### #### ####[([3], [5], 'NEU'), ([3], [7], 'NEU')]

This is the first time I 've ever reviewed anything on Amazon , but I was so disappointed I had to say this game is a ripoff for the price . Sure , it has nice graphics and is entertaining ... for about 30 minutes and then it 's over . Our 4 year old was so excited to play it , but after about 30 minutes our child had easily found all the items and stars and could n't proceed . So I was called over . I tried clicking everywhere thinking this game could n't be over already ... there must be a way to get to the next set of levels . I thought nobody would charge this much money for a game that 's about 30 minutes long , right ? Wrong . That 's it . One set of levels with 5 locations and 5 challenges . I even checked a couple You Tube videos saying they are the full game and their total durations are not much longer than 30 minutes . Our child was immensely disappointed. < br />< br /> I tried to skim all the reviews here before buying this amidst all the glowing reviews , and I never saw any review mention the game was about 30 minutes long . Too bad I did n't look on You Tube to see how short this game is . If anyone had warned me it was so short ( the shortest game I 've encountered in my life ) I would 've never bought it . It also came new but not shrink wrapped in a tiny cardboard sleeve which was not mentioned . When I buy retail software I 'm used to it coming shrink wrapped. < br />< br /> Unless your child likes to play the same 5 locations and 5 challenges over and over , I suggest you spend your money on anything else which will last longer , such as a Sesame Street video .#### #### ####[([36], [35], 'NEG'), ([36], [39], 'NEG')]

I am rating the free upgrade version I recently installed , not the USB flash drive , but I believe they are the same . For one thing , I tried to get the Windows 10 upgrade in 3 of my machines , but only one took . The other two refused let me upgrade and did n't give a reason ; just said &# 34 ; update failed &# 34 ; . The three machines all had Windows 7 home version preinstalled . The one that worked is the one that I recently reinstalled a fresh copy of Windows 7. < br />< br /> Anyway , I tried using Cortana , one of the new attractions that is similar to Siri . Could n't get the microphone to work , a nice microphone I bought a few weeks ago . The computer itself says that microphone is installed properly and shows bar response , but Cortana says it ca n't hear anything . I have never had trouble with microphones in my life . I tried two different microphones . In the end , the piece of junk does n't work , so I type in my questions . All it does is show me the Bing search . I could have used Firefox for that !< br />< br /> If I were the one who designed Cortana , I 'd SHOOT MYSELF ! How dare they push this thing out when it is n't working right ? Do those Microsoft people have no shame at all ???< br />< br /> Windows 10 sucks as much as Windows 8 with the big slabs that are supposed to be shortcuts but actually just blocks the view and take up space . Ca n't find the list of programs . Super annoying. < br />< br /> Luckily , this computer is the one my son uses , so I will let him suffer rather than getting it back to Windows 7 . I will not be upgrading my other Windows 7 computers ( I have 5 more ) . Microsoft is offering the free upgrade hoping to change all the Window 7 computers out there into Windows 10. < br />< br /> My question : WHAT THE HECK FOR ???< br />< br /> Note : After I wrote the above review , I reinstalled Windows 7 in another one of my computers which could n't get Windows 10 . Once I got the fresh copy in , the Windows 10 upgrade option showed up .

The product was fine and was working as advertised . However , when my hard drive died and I had to reinstall this software I found that the download link I was given originally was invalid , and that I needed to purchase &# 34 ; extended download service &# 34 ; for $ 8.50 to be able to re-download , because I had not purchased this &# 34 ; insurance &# 34 ; ahead of time . To me , to charge money for a service which would cost Cyberlink very little , is not good customer service and not a good experience . Before buying this product take into consideration that it may cost extra if you ever lose your downloaded file , or be prepared to spend your time managing your downloaded file and keeping track of it .#### #### ####[([14, 15], [16], 'NEG'), ([14, 15], [95, 96], 'NEG'), ([28, 29], [35], 'NEG')]
Compared to version 9 , this is a greatly improved product . While &# 34 ; 9 &# 34 ; was prone to crashing or freezing my computer , Sony Movie Studio Platinum Suite 12 is far better at handling higher resolution files without causing problems. < br />< br /> This software has plenty of features , and if you install Sound Forge , which is included , you will have the ability to manipulate and combine audio and video into some sophisticated final products. < br />< br /> While this software is probably more than enough for the average home videographer , you 'll face a steep learning curve before you are able to fully utilize all of the features . I found the documentation to be less than useful , and far from comprehensive . But between the poor Sony documentation , and online tutorials on YouTube , you should be able to muddle your way through the first few weeks of use . Once you have reached a basic level of competence , you 'll find that this is pretty decent software. < br />< br /> This software presents your video and audio clips as virtual &# 34 ; film &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; tape &# 34 ; clips on a visual timeline . You are provided with a number of video and audio tracks , allowing you to add and layer multiple levels of video , audio , photographs , titles , music , and sound effects. < br />< br /> Unless you are a professional - I am not - you are more likely to be limited by the quality of your video and audio , and your skill with &# 34 ; Movie Studio &# 34 ; than with the capabilities of the product . Be aware , however , that this product requires a powerful computer with a fair amount of memory and decent graphics card . And even with all of that , creating high-definition video will probably be a time-consuming proposition .#### #### ####[([284], [54], 'POS'), ([284], [322], 'POS'), ([56], [54], 'POS'), ([62, 63], [130, 131], 'POS'), ([62, 63], [327], 'POS')]

This was a total waste of money . The program does n't randomly choose the next game - it only chooses the next game that it has lined up sequentially .

I have had bad experiences with Symantec programs in the past . Trend Micro has not allowed through a single piece of viral software or malware in the last 7 + years of me using it across 8 different machines . Very satisfied . I do n't have a single thing to complain about. < br />< br /> This is the way to buy security software . I buy the versions from a few years ago for the license key . Unlike other security software companies , Trend Micro lets you put in a serial from any year . Makes it much cheaper to buy because I can get it for around $ 5 a year instead of $ 40 to $ 80 a year ! Great buy#### #### ####[([15], [135], 'POS'), ([15], [17], 'POS'), ([38, 39], [35], 'POS')]

While the system was adequate , the fact that my personal information was somehow accessed by scam artists leads me to wonder just how secure the system is . I am receiving as many as four phone calls a day from a variety of people who all insist that I still have system mechanic ( I do n't ) and that there is an error message coming from my computer ( which is usually turned off when they call ) and that they need access to it in order to repair the problem . The first scam phone call was - what , a year ago ? I am still being hounded by these thieves who stole personal information from Iolo . Iolo seems to be right on top of it : the company has the tiniest little message hidden on their website about not talking to strangers ... This shows a real sense of urgency and uncompromising customer service to subscribers : lax protection of customer information and absolutely no effort to fix it . I tried to contact Iolo and speak to someone in a supervisory position at the beginning . Of course there is no one in charge - just overseas customer service people who stick to their scripts all the while insisting that they are authorized to handle any problem that anyone has . Then after meticulously demanding every little piece of information from me they make me repeat what the problem is - well , although I was worn down , the problem still had n't changed - I was still calling about the scam artists hounding me with information taken from Iolo 's files . Then of course this high powered person who is authorized to speak for the entire company - no need for a supervisor , simply said they were &# 34 ; sorry &# 34 ;--- well , did n't THAT just make everything better . A year later I am still getting calls from different caller ID 's . Iolo should be ashamed of themselves . They allowed the personal information of their customers to be accessed and they have proven themselves to be totally useless .#### #### ####[([2], [4], 'NEG')]

If you like Hidden Object games with a story and a variety of puzzles , this is a good offering . Two of the games are outstanding , interesting and challenging .

I 've been a licensee since at least v5 or 6 and I 've watched the suite change from intuitive and remarkable to duplicative and unremarkable. < br />< br /> Version 8 still retains some of the characteristics of their once-unique software and is far more intuitive to use than the dumbed-down v9 series , but you 're really better off using the more professional versions 5 or 6 , which you can often find for free . The software becomes rather generic after v6. < br />< br /> Worse of all is that they charge $ 79 to upgrade from version 9 to v 9.5 . New licensees pay the same $ 79 , so basically I 'm f ** ked over for having supported them for rice gears and five paid upgrades . This is exactly the type of company we want to see fail . Please help that happen ! There are far superior products out there to waste time with anything from on1 . It seems appropriate to cripple developers who remove features and who are not loyal to the early adopters who helped them achieve unwarranted success .#### #### ####[([5], [69], 'NEG'), ([5], [7, 8], 'NEG'), ([5], [105], 'NEG'), ([5], [113], 'NEG'), ([5], [199], 'NEG'), ([102], [7, 8], 'NEG'), ([102], [105], 'NEG'), ([102], [113], 'NEG'), ([102], [199], 'NEG')]
Do n't get me wrong Microsoft Office is a great program . It would be even better if it were in my native language ENGLISH . I would not be so disappointed with this purchase if perhaps the description said it was in Spanish . I ordered this product under the impression that it would be in English due to the fact that the name of Microsoft Office : Mac Home and Student is written in English . Then when I received this product , I did what everyone else would do . I just stuck the CD into my computer to install . The installation process was in English BUT once I clicked on Word every thing was in Spanish . I took the CD out of my computer and written on it was Office : Mac Hogar Y Estudiantes . I thought maybe being the airhead that I am that perhaps I accidentally ordered it in Spanish however no where on the description does it say anything about it being in Spanish and it does have Hogar Y Estudiantes as the name of the product . Since I already opened this software I could not return it or receive . I would advise customers to purchase this software elsewhere . Thank You .#### #### ####[([6], [9], 'NEG'), ([10], [9], 'NEG')]

I have to disagree with a lot of the reviewers on this thread.My personal opinion is that this product is the best kept secret in the music software world . I originally bought this product as a way to work with MIDI drum parts . I figured it only cost $ 40 so if I could n't get it to work I was n't out too much money . Once I started using it , it was WAY BEYOND my expectations . I agree with some of the comments about it being difficult to use , install , understand , etc . but I have a background in recording and was able to get up and running in about 3 days ( so I could see for the average user this might be more frustrating ) . But , once I got set up I was on my way . This program is PACKED with features . It is essentially a studio in a box . I 'm not sure amazon will allow it , but here is a link to a song I recorded on MC 4 . ( https :// www.youtube.com / watch ? v = wwk-JVXiTLI ) All parts were tracked separately and drums were imported MIDI tracks from a live drummer . There are some limitations . The default drums sounds are n't great and you can only have 20 effects active at one time ; which go pretty quickly when you are using compression , EQ , delay , etc . which is why I am giving 4 stars . Otherwise , I would give this 5 stars . I have been using this product for 6 years . The only addition I made was adding in addictive drums to get better drum sounds . Otherwise , I have never upgraded this product as others suggest you have to do . For anyone that has some experience with mixing and recording , this program is a gold mine .#### #### ####[([298], [296], 'POS'), ([298], [153], 'POS'), ([298], [225, 226], 'POS')]

A lot of reviewers have complained of the small print . For those who may be concerned , permit me to provide some feedback . I 'm 84 but have had the lens of one eye replaced due to cataracts . As a result I read everything , books , newspaper , etc. , without glasses . The only time I use glasses is if the print is quite small . With the CheatSheet , although the type is small , I have no trouble reading it as long as it is in good light . I would thiink one would only need glasses or other visual aid if they require this to read a newspaper . I did have one complaint , however . In the &# 34 ; exposure mode &# 34 ; section there are short descriptions of exposure modes such as Av aperture value , Tv shutter priority and so on . But image zone modes such as portrait , landscape and close-up are missing . Only sports mode is present . I 'm sure there are lots of folks who use these modes almost entirely - I know I do . Together , these modes comprise approximately 30 % of the modes dial - why they are missing seems strange to me .

It was a rocky start ordering from them , I had the older version of Cook'n and really liked it . I did n't even hesitate on ordering the new version , but with my Apple iphone and ipad I could n't get it too work on these mobile devices . It took me from March till July to finally get it working properly . I do have to say there support dept. was always very good and helpful . They responded within 1 day all of the emails I sent . Now I have updated there new app and everything works great . I love being able to see all of my recipes regardless of where I 'm at . I take my ipad in the kitchen to see a recipe rather than printing it off on paper . I also like being able to be at a friend or family members house and pulling up a recipe on my iphone if we need it to prepare .

Ok , it 's a given that Win 10 is better than 8.1 . It 's a pretty good OS . It 's also going to be supported for another 10 years .

If you are on a slow internet connection , it could take longer . If you are on Google Fiber at 1 Gb / s , can I come live at your house ? All approaches get you a fully working Win 10 machine . Check the current prices ( they change quickly ) . Right now you can save some real money going the Win 7 or 8.1 route . That * assumes * you have a DVD drive . If you do n't then there 's a bit of an added hassle getting the DVD onto t bootable flash stick ( or buying a DVD drive ).< br />< br /> Since these reviews hang around for a while - This was written when Win 10 first came out .

Windows 8 is a faster OS but Windows 10 is still young so it could get better . Microsoft deserve props for a relatively smooth launch and their massive list of compatible applications and hardware configurations out of the gate. < br />< br /> I never really missed the start button when Windows 8 came out and since upgrading to Windows 10 , I still use the keyboard shortcuts I 'm used to so do n't really use it again now it is back. < br />< br /> If you have Windows 8 / 8.1 installed and you like it then I 'd say hold off on getting Windows 10 until they have had a chance to release some updates . You have a year to get the upgrade for free so no major rush to install it now. < br />< br /> The biggest grievance is that you get errors like &# 34 ; Something went wrong &# 34 ; and that is all it will tell you , not what went wrong or how you could fix it .#### #### ####[([25], [24], 'POS'), ([7, 8], [31], 'POS'), ([32], [31], 'POS'), ([5], [4], 'POS')]

A lot of people do n't like the new setup delivered by this operating system and I can understand that.The &# 34 ; start &# 34 ; button leaves a lot to be desired but this is the only flaw that I have found in this operating system there are programs that add the original start button if you have to have it . I have found that the other features included make navigation easier . I like the side ribbon on the desktop because you can quickly search your system for applications and files . Additionally you can easily view your system 's control panel , settings , and personalization features . Overall I think this was great refresh on an outdated windows 7 . Sure some features could be improved upon but with the release of windows 10 , you get the best of both windows 7 and 8.1 . Since windows 7 or 8.1 is cheaper than a new copy of windows 10 , I 'd suggest trying this out and if you do n't like it then upgrade to 10 FOR FREE until July 29 , 2016 .

First of all , you can download a FREE DEMO VERSION for free at the ProSoft web site. < br /> The Trial Version will scan your drive and show you all the files it finds , and evaluates the odds of successful recovery of each file . You will not be able to perform any actual recovery with the trial version . But it gives you a Windows Explorer-like interface where you can go through folders and examine filenames . So basically , you can find out if this tool will work for you and your drive . I would highly recommend doing this , before shelling out any $.< br />< br /> You can then purchase an activation code for the full version . I would suggest not doing this through Amazon , because you 'll have to wait for something to come in the mail . I bought mine through Herman Street.com and it was only $ 30 . I got the activation code within about 3 minutes in my email . If you 've already downloaded the Trial Version from ProSoft , you can just enter your activation code and it will enable all the recovery features , without downloading anything more . The PC that 's running Data Rescue PC does not need to be on a network to operate , the software itself verifies the activation code. < br />< br /> In my case , this tool worked perfectly . I had a drive with Windows 7 installed , and it decided not to boot one day . Could n't boot in Safe Mode , and the onboard Dell diagnostic tool reported a Hard Drive Error ( very vague ) . Windows Recovery hung at a blue screen with a mouse cursor , not doing anything . So that 's what led me to recovery tools . This one got very good reviews . I popped the drive out , hooked it up to another PC with a SATA cable , and installed Data Rescue PC3 on the other PC . It was very easy to recover all my files , although it took a very long time to do so ( I had hundreds of GB ) . It will vary of course depending on your processor speed / destination drive / number of files .#### #### ####[([281, 282], [283], 'POS'), ([281, 282], [352], 'POS')]

The product was put in an envelope and so was crushed flat on arrival . The software itself went end-of-life many years ago and izotope do not support it at all .

Its harder to learn then I expected . Way harder , especially since I use several different photo editing programs as it is .

I have been watching the tutorials that are in the help files and main opening page . I also have viewed a few dozen videos on youtube telling me / showing me how to do stuff with PSE . I even purchased 2 books on how to use PSE 13 and still I struggle with it . BUT WHEN I FINALLY get it to do what i want it to do , I love the results .

This product and particularly the tech support staff were like a dream after a nightmare supplied by Apple . After taking my MacBook Pro , which would not boot , to the Apple Store , I was told it had a display card problem and needed to be sent to CA for repair . I asked if my data was safe since I had not backed up in the four years I had the computer . ( I know , I know , but am I the only person who does n't back up ? ) I was told that it was probably ok since my hard drive had been checked and had no problems , this by someone from the inaptly named Genius Bar . Without a text or email or any communication , the processor was replaced , the operating system reloaded and the hard drive reformatted . When it was returned I was told that my data was gone . I called several data recovery operations and was told various things - impossible , maybe 50-50 but it will cost $ 300 to find out then more by the hour for the work . I call the Data Rescue people , and found out for free that recovery was possible . Then for $ 99 the recovery was done . But the most impressive part of the story was the patient , careful , helpful tech support I got . I called several times and spoke to several people and always got the most courteous and helpful support I have received in almost 30 years of working with a computer .

Ok , it 's a given that Win 10 is better than 8.1 . It 's a pretty good OS . It 's also going to be supported for another 10 years . It 's a real good bet that &# 34 ; earlier &# 34 ; Microsoft products will go end of life well before this does . It 's also a good bet that as newer hardware comes out , you * will * need Win 10 to support it . All of the machines I have upgraded to Win 10 from 7 and 8.1 have done fine . I had one video driver on one of the 6 machines that needed to be updated ( 10 minute fix ) . That 's pretty amazing for a Microsoft OS upgrade. < br />< br /> Right now , you have a couple of choices here on Amazon . You can grab this flash version of Win 10 and directly install it . No fuss , no problems it 's a pretty easy thing to install . There are two other choices . You can buy either Win 8.1 or Win 7 disks and do the free upgrade . In both cases make sure you get the &# 34 ; with SP1 &# 34 ; versions to reduce the hassles . You will need to do a * lot * of upgrades from Microsoft Update with either one . I 've done both , the Win 7 process * seems * easier. < br />< br /> So what does this one do for you ? It saves 1 or 2 days of poking at the computer every so often to tell it to do updates again . Could you do them faster than that ? Sure , but you would need to sit at the machine for hours . If you are on a slow internet connection , it could take longer . If you are on Google Fiber at 1 Gb / s , can I come live at your house ? All approaches get you a fully working Win 10 machine . Check the current prices ( they change quickly ) . Right now you can save some real money going the Win 7 or 8.1 route . That * assumes * you have a DVD drive and do n't need to hassle with converting a DVD to a flash stick for the install. < br />< br /> Since these reviews hang around for a while - This was written when Win 10 first came out . You have a year to go from Win 7 to Win 8.1 at this point . A year from now , doing a free upgrade from 7 or 8.1 probably is n't going to work .#### #### ####[([19], [18], 'POS'), ([104, 105], [116], 'POS')]

Its essentially Windows 8 with a reworked UI . The good news with that is there are few compatibility issues . If your stuff worked on 8 , chances are good it will work on 10 .

As far as the OS is concerned , you get the same old constant nag screens and same old stupid architecture . Performance is good after a bare metal install as were earlier releases .

Now 2009 does n't work correctly on the &# 34 ; new &# 34 ; Ancestry.com , in addition to its own buggy operation . So I started looking for a replacement . I had downloaded the trial version from the Calico Pie website and was very pleased with its operation . Even the trial version took in my whole combined family tree . I was very pleased with the interface , and since I am not a touch typist I like the fact that when I set focus to type something in the focus stays even if the mouse gets bumped . This was not the case with FTM 2009 and due to hot key interaction caused many problems . All in all my experience with the trial was so rewarding that I bought the program . Once the full version was loaded I explored the links on MyHeritage and found new information that needs to be explored .

No problems at all with the set up . Insert the disk and go , it 's that simple . Takes about 20 minutes to install , but will then run through about 2 hours of updates . Use 32 bits if you have less than 3GB of memory , otherwise buy a 64 bit version . The 64 bit version will work in smaller systems too , but you run the risk of drivers for older devices not being available. < br />< br /> This disc ca n't be used for an upgrade . Use it if you are installing a new hard drive . Just install your hard drive and disconnect the old one .

It 's an APP for communicating with spirits . It runs on Windows 7 beautifully . It 's a Shoutcast station scanner and also comes with it 's own sound bank if you do n't have internet . I fired it up ( did n't have to register first , give you ten days to register E-Mail came back within 10 minutes after I copied and pasted my Order Invoice in the E-Mail given to me on the CD ) all registered and started playing around . The purchase , the lighting quick response time of support ( my windows sizes were zoomed , not their fault ) and the application are beyond my expectations .

My worst concern about buying this product was that it was not a legal copy of MS Office Pro 2010 . I never did get a prompt to activate with the product key until today ; 31 days after installation . And guess what ??? ? This copy is for corporate and / or institutional use ONLY and must be activated by a network administrator !< br />< br /> When I first received the product , it was evident that it had been opened and used previously .... . the MS certification seal was broken , and there were smudge marks on the disc . It installed fine , but when I tried to open an Excel file today , it warned me that the product had not been activated and was a corporate / institutional version . I tried to activate , but it would never go to a page to enter the code . So , I have paid for a product that is n't legal to use !< br />< br /> BTW , I took pics ( with my phone ) of the windows which popped up telling me this was not a personal user copy .

Nancy Drew : Labyrinth of Lies was the seventh game I played in the series ; my SO and I chose this game to purchase as a &# 34 ; new-ish &# 34 ; ND title , and it was the best entry in the series we 'd played . Our favorite parts were the immersive setting , developed through the graphics , music , and puzzles . The graphics were rich , exotic , and it was the clear the designers greatly enjoyed bringing ancient Greece to life . The music , rashly labeled &# 34 ; elevator music &# 34 ; in other reviews , was charming and had an authentic Greek &# 34 ; beat &# 34 ; to it . The puzzles , while sometimes tedious , were satisfying to solve and appropriately challenging . My SO 's favorite was the seed puzzle near the end : colorful , logical , and perilous . All in all , we were really bummed when we knew the game was coming to a close , but the ending was very satisfying !< br />< br /> We liked the story 's complexity and enjoyed each step of the way . It was never clear who the &# 34 ; villain / esse &# 34 ; might be , since they all acted shifty and suspect . The characters were memorable and revealed surprising details as the story progressed . They all carried a unique sense of character depth to them , at least by the end . Unlike the other titles we played , much of the character development was contained in personal notes found on their tablets ( a modern touch ) - it was very cool to hear their thoughts. < br />< br /> Overall , the game can be overwhelming -- there 's a LOT of content in here . Some of the puzzles were listed , or noticed , but not solvable until a certain event happened , making a certain HARDWARE TOOL accessible where we otherwise expected it to be . Grudge aside , there are a ton of mini-games ( 10 on the cell phone !) , and if anyone likes science ( Chemist , here ) , the game includes testing materials for authenticity using bonafide analytical techniques ( fluorescence , spectroscopy , and reactivity ).< br />< br /> If you 've read this far , read no more : buy . Enjoy . You wo n't go wrong with this purchase and I 'm sure you 'll enjoy the story .#### #### ####[([63], [108], 'POS'), ([63], [132], 'POS'), ([63], [429], 'POS'), ([69], [71], 'POS'), ([91], [108], 'POS'), ([91], [132], 'POS'), ([91], [429], 'POS'), ([61], [108], 'POS'), ([61], [429], 'POS')]

The McAfee LiveSafe program will cripple your ability to do your computer work . Once this program is installed on your computer , the results are daily popups . There are two kinds of popups . The first is a popup that asks if you want more information about the McAfee software . This kind of popup is annoying . Every single day , this popup occurs once . To get rid of this popup , you just click on the word , &# 34 ; no. &# 34 ; The second kind of popup is worse , because the only way to get rid of this popup is to turn off the computer . This popup takes the form of a dialogue box that asks , &# 34 ; When should we remind you about all this ?&# 34 ; This kind of popup is actually like a virus , because it takes the form of a stable dialogue box that blocks your ability to have access to any of the files on your desktop and blocks your ability to access any of the folders on your desktop . To get rid of this popup , and to gain access to your computer files , you are forced to reboot your computer . My opinions regarding the McAfee Corporation , its employees , its software engineers , its management , its marketing staff , its contractors , its distributors , and the vendors who sell or install this program , are not positive opinions . I believe that the correct term that applies to McAfee Livesafe is not &# 34 ; virus &# 34 ; but that the best , most accurate , and most correct term is &# 34 ; malware. &# 34 ;#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5], 'NEG')]

When I asked where online or if they could send me a link , they responded that they couldn't. < br />< br /> I would not recommend this product , nor do I plan on purchasing from Nuance in the future . The product itself is decent to an extent , but Nuance 's tech support is rotten .#### #### ####[([52], [53], 'NEG'), ([52], [158], 'NEG'), ([52, 53], [158], 'NEG')]
I have twin boys both at the bottom of the 3rd grade reading level . It was discovered that my one son had eye tracking problems . While attempting to decode words he would insert letters that were not there and would say words completely different from the word on the page but with the same meaning ( he was guessing based on context ) . I took him for vision therapy which definitely made improvements but he still needed more . My Dr. recommended the Ace Reading program which I purchased with the goal of improving both boys reading speeds this summer . My one son doubled his reading speed . His problem was focus . Even though I was prompting him to read faster , he would read the words at a leisurely pace with many long pauses . He would start off-topic discussion right in the middle of a sentence . The Acereader pushed him to read faster so his mind could n't wander to off-topic discussions . My son with the e-tracking problem has increased his speed by 20 WPM . He still has trouble skipping words or lines and reading accurately when reading a full page . It was eye-opening to watch him read with almost 100 % accuracy when only 1 word was flashed at a time in the middle of the screen . The eye movement drills and highlighted text are definitely improving his reading accuracy . He was extremely frustrated with the eye-span comprehension games because the default times were much too fast for him to read the words , decipher whether they were the same or different and press the correct key . Customer Support was very helpful with showing me how to slow down these drill using Menu mode and showed me several options in Reading mode that I can use to enter reading text that matches his needs . I 'm very hopeful that continued use of this program will have him meeting all his reading goals and struggling less in school . A nice options compared to the $ 20 / hour reading class I was considering sending him to this summer . The classes may not have addressed his problem areas .#### #### ####[([23, 24], [25], 'POS'), ([23, 24], [239], 'POS'), ([23, 24], [260], 'POS'), ([305, 306], [25], 'POS'), ([305, 306], [260], 'POS')]

I have been a loyal user of True Image for many years ... that is about to end . Older versions of True Image were stellar ! Older versions came with a bootable CD , compression was great , and imaging was fast ! I was very disappointed with this version because it was not bootable . Against my preference , I was forced to install the software on my PC . When I created an image , it took forever ! Additionally , I created an image from a source that had 11 GB of data . However , the image size was 30 + GB ? What 's that about ?!?!!?! ? How can the backup image be 3 times the size of the source disk ?? ? Even though the documentation indicates there are settings for compression , I could n't find them .

I went to chat and they took control of my computer and said there was a problem with McAfee and try again in a few hours . I did this and again went to chat who tried to load it and told me I had to go to another part of the company . I called , a woman worked on it , and said it would install and hung up . It did n't work . I called again , someone spent a really long time on it and said I had to go to the antivirus section where I was told they could not help me , but would recommend someone I could pay . I was furious , asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there was no one available . I hung up . I looked up McAfee online and found an area that said all problems would be immediately dealt with . I sent my complaint and was sent the connection to go back to chat . No one has contacted me .

I purchased this for my Dad . He composes music on his keyboard and wanted a software that would convert that to sheet music so he could print it out . First problem was the software would not load on his IMac with latest OS . Like others said it kept crashing . Customer service at Sibelius sent him a link to download product . This allowed him to load the program finally . The next problem was the music only loaded the music to the treble clef and not the bass . Again , he called cust . Support and they tried to help . They suggested he get a midi to pull the music from . He did that and still it only loads the treble clef . There is an app that does the same thing for . 99cents . Keep that in mind if you only need that . Support was unable to fix this issue and suggested it was a compatibility issue with his keyboard or computer . After emailing cust service several times , I did get quick responses . However , because most of the support was done over the phone , support will not take the product back citing their software does n't have compatibility issues . If you do your research , which arguably Dad should have done before he had me purchase this for him , you will see that it is a KNOWN ISSUE that this product loads only to the treble clef for a lot of people . There are videos , tutorials and the like from customers because it is so difficult to get this product to work . Even with all those resources , and poor Dad tried a lot of them , it just wo n't work . So consider us added to the list of many frustrated unhappy people who have purchased this product .#### #### ####[([35], [76], 'NEG'), ([35], [274], 'NEG')]
Be aware the software that comes with this product is extremely limited . It will only let you save the file in highly-compressed file formats , WMV and MPEG . The assumption they make is that you are too stupid to do anything other than copy to a DVD , another out-dated format . If you hope to edit the files or save them for a longer period of time ( at least if using it to preserve your family home movies on VHS ) the Roxio software is not useful . When you evaluate the price , consider that all you are paying for is the analog connector , which could probably be found for far less elsewhere .#### #### ####[([3], [11], 'NEG'), ([86, 87], [11], 'NEG'), ([86, 87], [89, 90], 'NEG'), ([107, 108], [89, 90], 'NEG')]

It works fine , but in order to do more complex animation on it , the program has to register a picture as a &# 34 ; vector file &# 34 ; . So here is the problem : If you were to import a picture ( say , from Photoshop ) It would import as a still picture file , which is limited to only tweens and cannot be given bone structures ( which is the whole point of this program , by the way ) . Thing is , picture files cannot be converted into vector files . Trust me , I tried , I looked up tutorials and everything. < br />< br /> With that said , if you 're just going to be making simple animations , this software could work , but if you 're planning on doing more complex stuff , it 's probably not your thing and I 'd suggest trying out Anime Studio Pro .#### #### ####[([16], [37], 'NEG')]

While living in the United States I had McAfee LiveSafe for a year without incident . Nothing happened to warrant interaction above the mundane , so I subscriber for another year . I signed up for the second year in May 2015 . Then on July 10th 2015 I went to Jamaica where I was out of range of my service provider , so I had to get a local sim card . The minute I installed the new sim card the phone was locked down . It took me three days of sharking my friends' phones and wi-fi to get the phone unlocked. < br />< br /> After two weeks in Jamaica , the sim slot on my phone got damaged and the phone could not read the sim card . I took it to the repair shop but they did not have the part to fix it . I took an old phone to them next day , which was not charging . They repaired the charging port and I transferred the sim card from the other phone to it . McAfee immediately locked the phone down and for seventy-two hours now I have been trying by every means at my disposal to get McAfee to unlock my phone ; without an iota of success. . McAfee has no way of identifying me as me . So far I have interacted with five different agents of McAfee , each reassuring me that thye will solve my problem ; each one sending command to my phone , giving me temporary pin , or referring me to a site where I can send the command myself . NOTHING HAS WORKED . I am finding out that McAfee 's tecnicians are in England , their sales dept is in the USA , and their customer service in India , and none have instant contact with the other . You give relevant information to one and then get an email from the other asking for the identical info. < br />< br /> So you see , McAfee provides excellent protection for my phone . They are excellent when it comes to locking down your phone , but they are pathetic imbeciles when it comes to unlocking the phone which they so efficiently locked . I am in a dangerous situation because if I am attacked I cannot make a phone call . I am in a foreign country and no one can reach me . THANKS McAfee . I use my phone to protect myself , and you are protecting my phone from me .#### #### ####[([116, 117], [122], 'NEG'), ([116, 117], [126, 127], 'NEG'), ([169, 170], [122], 'NEG'), ([169, 170], [167], 'NEG'), ([304, 305], [122], 'NEG'), ([304, 305], [126, 127], 'NEG'), ([304, 305], [167], 'NEG')]

Meh , 8.1 is n't that bad if you are very familiar with computers .

Would not load after several attempts . Called tech support . Had to allow them to take over computer to install program . Changes were made that I preferred not to change but had no choice .

Another chance for McAfee to make a great product but choked . Product definitely not worth the full retail asking price. < br /> One good thing . Tech support did not take any longer than 10 minutes to address my problem .

For more than 2 weeks , we ’re going back in forth with email , until they stop responding because they have to refer the problem to their engineering team . Do n’t take my word for it , search the web for installation problem of pinnacle studio , from the earlier version to the latest , THERE ARE FORUMS JUST FOR INSTALLATION PROBLEMS . So I ’ve just wasted my money , ca n’t return a software .

Great device for learning English ! I bought it for my mom and it 's easy to install , easy to use , and most importantly , easy to learn ! You hear the words , you say the words , you do it all ! It 's been outstanding , the only drawback is the price . It 's a bit steep for those who wish to learn , and after about 2 months , you have to begin paying for the online service that they provide . I think a great substitute for Rosetta Stone would be Duolingo , considering it 's free . But if you want a more in depth experience , definitely get a Rosetta Stone .#### #### ####[([99], [53], 'POS'), ([99], [104], 'POS'), ([17], [15], 'POS'), ([21], [19], 'POS'), ([21], [27], 'POS'), ([29], [19], 'POS'), ([29], [27], 'POS'), ([56], [53], 'POS'), ([56], [104], 'POS')]

My kids have loved using this typing instructor game . I know there are lots of typing instructor games that can be found on the internet , and many are free . However , I have some young kids and I do n't like the idea of them getting on internet yet . This was a great choice for them . They enjoy playing it and their typing has improved quickly. < br />< br /> The only downside to this program is it really is a 1-time use installation code . I had to upgrade the computer that my children were using and tried to install this on the new computer . The installation would n't take until I called the company to get a new installation code . I understand the security reasons to keep people from buying one copy for multiple computers , but a 1-use code just wastes time . I had to send an email and make a phone call and wait for their response - I know that does n't sound bad , but it really is a bit of a hassle. < br />< br /> Overall , I 'm pleased with the software and my kids still use it ( yes , even after 2 1 / 2 years ) .#### #### ####[([67], [30], 'POS'), ([67], [69], 'POS'), ([67], [78], 'POS'), ([67], [197], 'POS'), ([81], [30], 'POS'), ([81], [78], 'POS')]

This is a really old program so I probably should n't have taken the chance on it for Windows 8 . However , after fidgeting with settings and doing computer geek stuff , I finally got this to run on a not-so-great Windows 8 computer . Unfortunately , the kids ended up thinking this was boring and since it still ran VERY slow , they got bored with it and refuse to use it for longer than a few minutes . I see the price now is almost half what I paid 2 months ago ... . so I wish I had watched prices for a while before I bought it . I normally create my own educational material for my kids but I thought I would try something different and I had actually found a newer version of this through an online college for around $ 35. Maybe the newer version is worth the money , but I do n't think this one is great . If we can get it to work faster and see more of the materials on it then I will come back and update the review , but for now , do n't buy it if you have Windows 8 ! !#### #### ####[([84], [41], 'NEG'), ([5], [4], 'NEG')]
Windows &# 34 ; upgrades &# 34 ; are WORSE THAN USELESS. < br />< br /> I had to buy Windows 8 with my new tablet , and it is absolute trash-much harder to even access your desktop than with Windows 7 , and it keeps slamming unwanted applications onto the screen when I try to access my desktop . Very user unfriendly. < br />< br /> When I had to get Windows 7 with a new computer , several programs I owned -- including the rather costly Corel PhotoPaint -- would not work .

Well , I purchased this after purchasing an older version that did n't work with Windows 8 and returning it .

Great ! Fastest Scanning Anti-Virus ! Easiest on System Resources 4-10 MB of Memory ! Do n't believe Bitdefender their anti-virus is not the easiest on system resources or fastest ! Unlike Bitdefender that uses 250-400MB of memory and is constantly using lot 's system resources downloading virus signatures every hour as do most antiviruses Webroot does none of that ! It takes up almost no system resources . It scans from the cloud . Is better at detection and blocking malware . The only problem I have is Webroot 's browser plugin classifies a lot of websites incorrectly or wo n't let you visit sites they say are risky sites without white listing them , no proceed without white listing . Also the browser protection wo n't let you copy and paste in forms on websites or copy to clip board some times and this drives me crazy with no way to individually customize browser protection . You can only shut it off . Then the Webroot icon turns red and tells you your not protected .

I purchased this to run on my Mac Mini to run with Parallels 10 . I saw some mixed reviews which some stated it would not run on a Mac and some that dyed it would . I took my chances and purchased it along with Parallels 10 . When I opened the windows envelope there was a piece of paper wrapped around it that stated that this software would not run on a Mac with an exclamation mark , whether you had parallels or VMware or boot camp . Well I 'm here to tell you that it installed perfectly with parallels 10 and runs flawlessly . It comes with the product key and activated fine . I would recommend the latest version of parallel to be safe . I do not recommend using windows security essentials though . It is now being reported that this is a very poor free anti virus and malware program from Microsoft and has tested very poorly in tests . I recommend a good 3rd party program .#### #### ####[([12, 13], [150], 'POS'), ([68], [70], 'POS'), ([68], [106], 'POS'), ([68], [150], 'POS')]

This is nice technical software . I bought this along with my tablet as it was inexpensive , and I could learn to draw digitally .

I am not happy with this product . I own a small business and need the protection of a good anti-virus / security . I researched and found that this was one of the top rated programs so decided to get rid of Avast ( which went down hill and became not good ) and to go with this one . I am constantly telling it that certain emails are not Junk or Spam but it keeps moving them to the Junk Folder . Then it lets junk into my regular folder . I am constantly having to check both folders as , keep telling it that my business emails are NOT junk / spam , and have to constantly monitor it . I have set up rules for emails but it does no good . The &# 34 ; Safe Money &# 34 ; feature does n't work half the time and freezes up . I will be getting rid of this as soon as possible .

Had to return it because I found elsewhere on the internet where you can buy LEGAL software from Microsoft for about 10 % the cost of this software .

If you have an love XP , DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! . The application would not install , after 3 attempts I called McAfee 's phone help and the first tech ask if he could take over my computer by remote control . I thought I was dealing with a professional and allowed this to happen . After his efforts & several re-boots my computer would no longer boot up , I could n't even get it to start in the &# 34 ; safe mode &# 34 ; it was so screwed up , no applications would open of even attempt to do so . After more than an hour , he ask if he could email me a patch to another computer that I could capture on a thumb drive and load it to my non-functioning computer and that would fix the problem . I ask if he had been listening to me as I made it quite clear that my computer is no longer functional , how would I install this fix on a virtually dead computer ? ? We went around that tree several times and I finally realized that this so called tech was incompetent and hung up him . Called again hoping to get a more competent person and talk to . Tech # 2 could not help & switched me to a higher level of help . No help there either and was transferred to McAfee 's highest lever of tech help which ended in me being told I will need to take my computer to a repair shop - sorry .

This software is only compatible with Windows 95 or 98 . It cannot be updated for Windows 8 . I ordered this product March 16th of 2015 & just opened the package today July 26th 2015 .

The product should have stated that it was not compatible with the versions of Windows that everyone uses . It should not be sold when it is an obsolete software product . I tried to go to the website www.Broderbund.com they are the ones who designed the software , to see if there was some sort of update for this version .

I could not install the product from DVD . This was very disappointing . I was really looking forward to using NaturallySpeaking since it could save me a lot of time . I 'm not sure why the product would not install . I keep my computer as plain as possible . I tried to install twice . I received an error 1330 . So I did a web search and found out that Nuance recognizes the error and proposes solutions . I tried one of the solutions . It was at this point learned I could no longer do a control-a to select all files from Windows Explorer . This made me worried that this product may have screw up my Windows 7 operating system . Installations should be rock solid . If I need to patch together the installation then it makes me wonder about the rest of the software . Obviously , this product was not thoroughly tested when it was released . Fortunately , I performed a system restore to get my Windows 7 back to normal . As it turns out trying this software was a real waste of my time. < br />< br /> If I could rate Amazon separately I would ( I 'd give five stars ) . Purchase was easy . The cost was much less than the Nuance Communications website . The package arrived the next day with Prime . And , creating a return was easy too . Way to go Amazon !< br />< br /> Suggestion : Products like this probably cost Amazon money .

This software is a near requirement for Dr. Lewin 's math classes at Kennesaw State University ( ethics aside ) . It covers the whole range of topics in Calculus , from Calculus 1 to Calculus 3 in that order . It is VERY in-depth . Also , it gives you the answers of examples in a mathematical notational way that Dr. Lewin only accepts for his exams ( any answer , or any deviation that is different than what is presented in here is a 0 grade from Lewin ) . So technically , you need this software in my opinion. < br />< br /> 2 major points :< br /> 1 ) You can download this for free ( book version ) online < br /> 2 ) Video version ( which buying this software is the only way to obtain ) does not explain anything in detail , nor give greater examples more than the book version. < br />< br /> I repeat : The videos are just the free book version in video format / lecture format .

I agree with someone else 's comments re the dice . In short , the computer cheats . It does n't matter what difficulty level you put in , the results tend to be the same ... your opponent always gets 90 % of the doubles . I actually started keeping track of this ... Harley will get 8 doubles , while I get 2 . Elayne got 8 doubles , I got 2 , etc. etc . There is no way you can win fairly . I do n't care if I win , but at least I want a fair shot at it . I love Backgammon because it is strategy , skill and LUCK OF THE DICE . The actual player actually does n't get lucky ... I have an older version of this game , plus the newest version ( 2013 ? ) ... . it does n't matter which one you use , the results are the same .

Their ' right out of the box accuracy ' claim is questionable . They claim you can speak at a normal rate and it can keep up , but it can not . I had a prior version ( about years ago ) and the only improvement I find for home use is being able to open documents and web pages . If you do n't mind having to SERIOUSLY proofread EVERYTHING , it is useful as it does type faster than I do .

I 've bought the Just Flight Combat Helicopters UH-1 Huey & CH-47 Chinook boxed ( CD-ROM ) version from Amazon . The Huey 's works pretty well with downloaded patches from the Nemeth Design internet site , but the CH-47 Chinook will not work and will never work in the add - on pack , no one can start the engines correctly in the orders of the including manual ... Why ? It was not easy for me to find out the reason but now I know it and I will give it to the Amazon customers in future . Just Flight make a very good work with their add-on 's but in that case there was a mistake : The CH-47 Chinook which will be installed with the Bell Huey ( The Bell Huey will start and fly normal in the FSX SP2 version ) in the pack but the Boeing Vertol CH-47 Chinook is for the ACCLERATION version ONLY and NOT for the normal FSX SP2 version . That means : The Bell Huey in the FSX will work and fly but the Boeing Chinook will not start the engines and get up in the air . I copy the site from the Nemeth Desgin Developement Group for you , so all customers can show it now by themself : http :// www.nemethdesigns.com / payware / 51-boeing-ch-47-chinook-for-fsx-new.html Please read also the most important last sentence in the description which is standing over the Download patch 1.01 : This addon requires Acceleration Expansion Pack for FSX to work properly . The most even all customers will going to be mad and / or angry if they want and try to start and fly the CH-47 Chinook in that Combat Helicopter pack .#### #### ####[([134], [26], 'NEU'), ([175], [26], 'NEU'), ([175], [42, 43], 'NEU'), ([22], [26], 'NEU')]

I had hoped this package began by teaching you words by visual association and building upon that . Instead you begin conjugating verbs and pairing them with words you are not familiar with . This makes it fairly tough but I 'm going to repeat the tougher lessons and try to stick with it though I was feeling turned off starting with lesson 2 . I would n't rate this product as the worst nor would I rate it to be the best either . I gave it three stars because I could n't give it 2-1 / 2 .#### #### ####[([22], [38], 'NEU')]
In theory the system is great . However I am getting a lot of programming bugs such as clicking next does not advance the lesson to the next question . Sometimes pressing the back button advances the lesson forward . Sometimes there appears to be only one question in the lesson , but if you move on to the next lesson and then back again another question will appear . Confusing ? Indeed ! These are very real issues that appear consistently in all the lessons . If the software would work properly and hence allow the beautifully thought out lessons to be effective , that would be great . As it is , it is just annoying . It seems more like sloppy beta software . When I wrote to Fuenz about the problems I got no response . I am using a Mac and ca n't be sure if these issues happen on Windows .#### #### ####[([125], [123], 'NEU'), ([125], [117], 'NEU'), ([3], [5], 'NEU')]

This new Norton Security works well in my PC with Windows 7 . I was using the older version called Norton Internet Security which Norton no longer sells . To install this , you have to un-install the older Internet Security first . I took the easy route and called Norton . They take control of your computer , un-install the old version and install the new version at no charge . Aside from a few early glitches for the first day , and one call back to Norton , this new version works great . I should have purchased Norton Security for 5 devices for only $ 5.00 more . That would let me give 4 friends a &# 34 ; key &# 34 ; to use for themselves .

Great sevice I have been using for about 4 years . Easy renewal process for subscription . 3-device subscription model for residential customers is very reasonably priced and reliable . I am in the IT field and we have not had any adware / spyware clogging our home computers / tablets fir the lst 8 , maybe even 10 years . Having a good router ( wifi too ) with the active firewall , QoS and Access Control settings , WPA2 ( AES ) encryption and a product like Norton Internet security is what lets you keep faith in the currently crazy and hacking-prone web world. < br /> P.S : personally I would recommend to always use your own router , installed after the cable modem ( ISP provided modem ) , even if they give you a router with Wifi capabilities . I have seen too many hime networks with basic ( WEP ) or even worse no encryption of any kind , always broadcasting their Wifi SSIDs . That is also true for some geek squad services , I have observed in the area , but even that is better than just relying on your cable box and TW technician to set the security properly. < br /> If you happen to be a retiree and not a techical person , do spend this one time fee to have a professional install your own Wifi router . If you are willing and able to spend 10-20k to renovate your kitchen ir bathroom , you should definitely NOT skip on your security .#### #### ####[([72], [25], 'POS')]

I love both games . There 's a bit of a learning curve if you 're new to Anno but once you get the hang of it , it 's a lot of fun .

Thankfully , 1404 is n't connected to U-Play and can be installed and launched normally. < br />< br /> It 's a steal to get both Anno 1404 with the Venice expansion pack and Anno 2070 with the Deep Ocean expansion pack at this price . Before you buy it 's a good idea to make sure your Windows computer 's system rating in Games is 4.3 or above ( Windows Vista or newer ) .

Windows 8 was a difficult move for many people . The user interface is optimized for touch , so it feels awkward at times with a mouse , and the combination between metro ui and desktop mode does n't quite mesh as well as it should . I admit , I too was a bit frustrated with the removal of the start menu . But ultimately these things are tiny gripes , and it 's really not so bad once you get used to it . The people who despise Windows 8 are largely either unwilling to adapt or computer illiterate. < br />< br /> I got Windows 8 when it was fairly new , and my experience has always been fairly positive . It is every bit as sleak and fast as Windows 7 , and I actually did enjoy some of the Windows Store Apps for a while . ( The novelty quickly wore off , though , as the selection is nothing compared to the iOS app store or Google Play . ) Compatibility has rarely been an issue for anything designed for Vista and above. < br />< br /> I do n't have a lot of huge pros to compliment about Windows 8 , but I do n't have any major complaints either . I do n't know that I would say it 's worth upgrading from 7 to 8 , because there just is n't that much of a difference , but I think it is pretty ignorant to say that it is much worse than Windows 7 , as many people imply . The enhanced task manager and some improved menus relating to system configuration are reason enough for me to say that Windows 8 ( and 8.1 ) is at least a step forward , even if not a very big one. < br />< br /> I bought this for a new rig , knowing the Windows 10 free upgrade is coming up . Looking forward to trying that out , and hopeful that this next iteration will be a big step forward .#### #### ####[([11, 12], [21], 'POS'), ([61, 62], [141], 'POS'), ([61, 62], [277], 'POS')]

Still confusing and difficult to use as ever ! We have been using DeLorme Street Atlas for over 10 years since purchasing our motorhome . Has a definite learning curve . Entering point A and point B are not too bad , it is the little things , like changing settings , making it take the route you want , and the missing roads that make this program frustrating . We had tried Streets and Trips at one point , but had issues with that as well . We updated from 2012 to 2015 but do n't see much difference . Still have to use Google Maps to find some places then put a Stop location on the map where the road SHOULD be , but is n't , on Street Atlas. < br /> One annoyance that 2015 has is that it seems to randomly change the map to point in the direction of travel , which we both hate . We want it pointing North all the time . When we go into options , the box for rotating in the direction of travel is greyed out and it IS unchecked , so we do n't know why it does it . Clicking on the arrow in the compass circle on the right side of the screen seems to fix it for a while. < br /> We used to do drive-by home occupancy inspections , and would do up to 60 in a day . This program was the only way we could successfully create our route around town . We would enter them in as stops , with our home as start and finish , and then rearrange and compute route until it looked like a good round trip . Of course we ran into problems with newer communities , but would then just find the location in Google and and it in on the map. < br /> The main plus of this program is that when using it on a nice 17 &# 34 ; laptop ( with a matte screen !) we can see surrounding areas and if we want to look at alternate routes , it is easier than on a 5.5 &# 34 ; phone or 5 &# 34 ; Tom Tom , which we have both as well. < br /> Overall , we like it and use it alot , but it could be more accurate and easier to use .#### #### ####[([5], [1], 'POS'), ([5], [3], 'POS'), ([5], [408], 'POS'), ([67], [68], 'POS')]

You can also completely change your automatically generated route by hand or make one from scratch .

I have been using various Paperport Pro for years . Last year my prior edition would not load into my new computer so I purchased Paperport 14 Pro. < br /> The program was a disappointment from the first day . On about every third scan , I received errors that my scanner was not properly connected . It was necessary to re-start every time ( which corrected the problem after waiting 5-minutes for a complete re-start ).< br /> On 7 / 18 / 15 , while using the program , it crashed with a Fatal Error . I reviewed several articles with suggested fixes . The fixes included uninstalling the program , removing remaining Nuance files and re-installing . Nothing worked . I found several comments on various websites indicating the same problem ( One even suggested re-setting the compatibility mode to Windows Vista SP2 . ( I have Windows 7 64-bit ).< br /> Nuance does not offer any suggestions , acknowledge the problem and ( according to to other folks ) does not reply with any fixes when an E-Mail is submitted .

Love this cookbook . I 've been using it for years but I love the new version that makes it so easy to use . I love adding my own recipes and those from the internet . The snag-it feature lets you copy and paste all the ingredients into the recipe all in the right places .

I have used Kaspersky Internet Security for many years and never had any trouble at all . This 2015 Edition has caused many problems with my Laptop Windows 8.1 as well as my computer with Windows 7 .

This software has the same problem most piano courses software or paper or even many teachers have . Almost all of the material was written over 50 years ago often much older . If you are n't interested in classical music it will be a bit of a slog to get through it. < br />< br /> Software-wise this program ran fine for me on a Mac with OS X 10.10 , but it looks like it 's just been patched over and over again just enough to keep it running since it was first written back in the mid-90 's . That said I have n't had any issues with it so far and it 's worked fine with my MIDI keyboard . The only complaint I have is I have a true MIDI keyboard with no sound engine at all so turning up the volume in the software and my keyboard is really quite unless I pound on the keys .

I bought this product directly from the manufacturer after reading a very positive comparative review : it had all the features I needed and I met all of the system requirements . Then came the nightmare . I tried to install it on Windows Vista , Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 . It got to 10 % installation , then stalled . Then I tried customer support , because no documentation is available for troubleshooting . The support site is circuitous : if it were a person , you 'd say it 's yelling at clients from a window telling them to go elsewhere , then when you go elsewhere , someone else yells out ... you get the picture . Went to FAQ , where all of the questions are about usage , not installation . When I attempted to contact support , I was required first to joing Subscribers' Club whose membership asks for personal questions I am not about to give strangers online . Therefore , I wish I could say this is the great product I read about , but since I have not been able to install it , I 'll go purchase an alternative .#### #### ####[([77, 78], [80], 'NEG'), ([46, 47], [80], 'NEG')]

Nor will I recommend it to friend or foe . I 'm disgusted. < br /> I ’ve been working with apps and utilities since DOS 4.0 . I retired as an IT desktop technician not that many years ago . I ’ve never had so much trouble with a utility as Acronis True Image . Acronis is focused on controlling license not supporting the people who buy their product. < br /> Years ago I upgraded Seagate Disc Wizard to ATI 2013 . That was fine until I rebuilt my machine and had to reload it . Nothing I did would fix the registration serial number . I hoped upgrading to ATI 2015 would resolve the registration issue . It took enormous time with the help desk to get operational . It was like working with my hands tied behind my back . I never did get a disk imaged. < br /> I had to rebuild my system again a few months back . ATI 2015 Upgrade ( registration serial number again ) was hopelessly broke . OK , I broke down and bought 3 seats of ATI 2015 ( build 6525 ) not the upgrade . Did that fix anything ? NO . I downloaded Win ADK 8.1 and built an ATI PE 2015 boot as the 1st test . When I tried to create an image of my primary drive it popped a dialog box , ” This is a trial version of True Image . I was never successful in getting a useable image with ATI . Shame on me for buying newer versions when the old ones did n’t get the job done . The problem is Acronis ties down the product attempting to keep hackers from using it . In the process they make the product incredibly difficult to use. < br /> Now , It ’s Windows 10 time . I ’m not going anywhere near Acronis True Image ever again .#### #### ####[([52, 53, 54], [47], 'NEG'), ([52, 53, 54], [177], 'NEG'), ([52, 53], [177], 'NEG')]

Serif has joined Microsoft in deciding that we are too stupid to know how we want things to work on our computers . A dialog during the installation process lets you choose a location for the program , then puts a shortcut at the at location and installs it where they want to .

I bought the program to migrate files to a new computer . I had to call tech support to get the program to work . I had a huge amount of files to transfer and it took four days to accomplish this with the program running continuously . The program stopped several times during the process requiring more calls to tech support . Tech support had to take control of both computers remotely to accomplish the set up . What really ticked me off was the program came with cables to do a wire transfer but they set it up to transfer the files by wifi . And the program downloads a file management program that tech sport hounds you to purchase and there is no letting go of this monster once it is installed . The program does not tell you this when you purchase it . So whenever you want to do anything on the computer the program butts in and requires you to use their program to use your new computer . Tech support is in India and the technicians may or may not be able to help you . The is a fee of several hundred dollars to use he program . This program also blocks the installation of new programs such as Dragon speech recognition software and even their tech support ca n't make it work . I am so pissed that this file manager comes without any notification that you are getting it . Had I known this I would never have bought it . I would have transferred the files manually . The PC Mover says programs will transfer from the old computer and be ready to use on the new computer without re installation . I had to rebuy and reinstall almost every program . So be forewarned . This program will transfer files but you do n't get what it says it will do . Now my computer is infested with an unwanted file manager program and I am not happy . I wish I had never bought this program . You are warned .#### #### ####[([49], [50], 'NEG'), ([49], [331], 'NEG')]

This is a tedious game to play because it requires control of every single action . I prefer to direct the action not control it . For example , when invading a planet I prefer to designate targets and let the AI determine how to complete the objective . In this game you must control first where to move , then where to shoot , then how many times to pull the trigger , then proceed to the next trooper and repeat the same process . This is a poor knock-off of Master of Orion II .#### #### ####[([14], [3], 'NEG')]

It 's been a long time . I am at least a few years behind on upgrades . I really have n't had any reason to do so up until now . I recently had been concerned about my old software working correctly with Windows 8.1 , which I moved to , and also with the coming of Windows 10 . This was a very reasonable offer that motivated me to migrate from OmniPage 15 to 18 . I like OmniPage very much . I have been using it for much more than a decade . I have tried other OCR software , but I believe that I am spoiled by OmniPage . Their new editions , however , are very expensive -- better put : cost-prohibitive -- and provide little new functionality as far as I am concerned in proportion to the money that is spent . This edition installs and seems to work well on Windows 8.1 . It registered quickly with the given Serial Number , Activated flawlessly , and so I am satisfied . I knew eventually I would have to upgrade to newer software , but was hanging on waiting for an opportunity like this to come . Hopefully , it will allow me to be able to seek another reasonably priced upgrade in the future , but as you can see , I am not in a hurry to spend more money on this !#### #### ####[([58, 59], [155], 'POS')]

The ABSOLUTELY best way for children to learn to type . The lessons consist of games in which juicy , delicious bugs -- work with me here ! -- each sport a letter and you must type said letter to slurp up the bug . Sounds disgusting ? Of course , which means your child will eat it up , if you 'll pardon the pun . All three of my children adored this game , and it taught them to type . While the game wo n't develop their speed much above 30 words per minute or so , it definitely teaches them the keyboard better than any other method .

WinZip was once an indispensable tool that I 've used on every machine since Windows 3.1 ; however , its utility has declined and Corel has loaded it with so much extraneous junk that I 'm too apprehensive to install it on a new PC . My primary dissatisfaction is one of Corel 's business integrity : a license-holding customer should NOT be provided with installation software that surrepticiously diverts the IE browser to Ask.com and installs a toolbar so simply so Corel can generate even more revenue IF the user accepts the &# 34 ; recommended &# 34 ; defaults . I get the fact that software companies need monetize their wares and recoup their investment ; however , for revenue consumers this is wrong . The prosumers in you might wish to use WinZip 's . iso file instead and make your modifications before installing. < br />< br /> In v18 and v19 there were big changes that increased the size of the graphics to accommodate touch screens , while eliminating the file tree that resembles Windows Explorer . As a result , referencing multiple folders and paths within a Zip is much less efficient . For example , while it 's possible to include folders and the file paths in order to restore these files later , the Path feature must be activated before files are added to the Ziip ( via a filter . ) This is neither efficient or intuitive . When 19.5 was released I tested it on a virtual machine and found it included additional &# 34 ; file management &# 34 ; software that installs as startup utilities . It appears that it can be turned off through the Options menu , but checking through Autoruns mine were still active . It simply reinforced my impression that Corel 's priority with WinZip is monetization , so check the privacy policy carefully should you choose to install .#### #### ####[([20], [22], 'NEG'), ([20], [161], 'NEG')]

I am a long – time user and fan of Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking . Over many years I ’ve found that each version was a step forward , but still buggy in its own way . I ’ve also long viewed Nuance customer support as deplorable . Nuance employs a very effective end-user firewall . Even so , I largely forgave the flaws which were overshadowed by what , for me was a continuing meaningful boost in productivity. < br />< br /> MY WILLINGNESS TO FORGIVE IS OVER ! I am one of the over 7 million people who now use the Microsoft Office suite by way of the recurring subscription plan , i.e. Microsoft Office 365 . Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking v12.5 Premium and ( I have it on good authority ) v13 Premium ARE NOT functionally compatible with Microsoft Office 365 . Nuance does not disclose this plainly and their only user ’s forum answer to a serious problem that forces users to rely on the ridiculously limited functionality of the last-resort Dragon Pad function suggests that DNS users stick with stand-alone versions of Microsoft Office . For multiple PC users like me , that imposes a huge , largely hidden additional expense. < br />< br /> In fairness , Microsoft is n’t quick to reveal that the Office 365 applications do not become 100 % resident on the host PCs . Instead , some sort of hybrid local / cloud / background is employed . It is this non-localized application residence that renders Nuance ’s Dragon Naturally Speaking largely incompatible with Microsoft Office 365 Nuance ’s Dragon Naturally Speaking or visa versa if you prefer. < br />< br /> Thus , the subscription model of the world ’s most popular office suite and the worlds most adopted voice recognition application want nothing to do with each other ! Neither company is particularly forthcoming about this glaring shortcoming . Each conveniently points a finger at the other , while neither bothers of offer a reasonably visible and / or accessible compatibility warning ― not one that a customer is likely to see prior to purchase anyway. < br />< br /> So … If you are a fan / user of Nuance ’s Dragon Naturally Speaking , know that Dragon WILL NOT FUNTION with Microsoft Office 365 applications in the way that Dragon users have become accustomed . Dragon dictation CANNOT be input directly into ( for example ) a Word document . The ONLY means of input is the multi-step process of ( 1 ) dictating first to the simple plain text Dragon dictation Pad , ( 2 ) selecting the desired text from the pad , ( 3 ) cutting or copying the selected text from the Pad and ( 4 ) pasting the text to your Word document . Even Google ’s free office suite does a better job than this ! It too requires use of the Dragon Pad , but the with the free Google app , the Dragon Pad is called up when dictating begins and moving the Dragon Pad text to the document is accomplished more easily with the Dragon Pad Transfer button / command. < br />< br /> I have the sense that this issue will catch up with and haunt Microsoft and / or Nuance ( Dragon ) , but a lot of money will have changed hands by then and a lot of users will feel frustrated at best , and duped at worst. < br />< br /> Making all this a bit worse is the fact that I viewed Dragon v12.5 Premium as the most pronounced advancement to the product ever . Perusing Amazon online reviews of Dragon 13 Premium suggests that a nearly 25 % of those bothering to review give Dragon 13 just ONE STAR ! Many of those reviewers appear to be experienced and until now , happy Dragon users. < br />< br /> I submit that if the reviews were based on the combined use of Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 13 WITH Microsoft Office 365 , the number of zero to one star reviews would skyrocket . Together , these products are a giant leap backwards and virtually useless as a boost to voice recognition productivity .#### #### ####[([304, 305], [265], 'NEG'), ([304, 305], [529], 'NEG'), ([261, 262], [529], 'NEG')]

But I am shocked and amazed , and how awesome this program is ! It is so good it can even tell the difference between ' end ' , and ' and ' .

It 's not Kapersky that I rated so low as an internet virus protection program , it is their Safe Money feature . Ever since I updated to the 2015 version , it does NOT work correctly with Windows 8.1 . Instead of the green border showing that my browsing is protected , I get a brown border and an error message in the lower right-hand corner telling me that KIS is not providing complete protection and says that protection against screenshots is disabled , which they are not . On startup , it tells me that my internet connection is not secure . How can that be when I have to use a network SSID and Security Key to even access the internet ? The program runs so slow that some of my websites wo n't open up . I have been emailing with Kapersky for more than a month now , and the problem is still NOT resolved .#### #### ####[([11, 12], [101, 102], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], [34, 35], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], [83], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], [129], 'NEG'), ([98, 99], [101, 102], 'NEG')]

This software uses a challenge response authorization scheme . Yes that 's right ; for a $ 20 piece of software . Upon installation and attempting to authorize a dialog box pops up saying &# 34 ; cannot connect to activation server &# 34 ; . I filled in the support request fields at the web site and explicitly explained that I tried doing this without any fire walls enabled . I received a response advising me to &# 34 ; be sure you turn off the firewall &# 34 ; ... Brilliant ; no ?? ? By this time it 's Friday afternoon , so I respond explaining AGAIN that when their product attempts to phone home , it does n't even invoke the firewall dialog box asking if I want to allow this program to establish an out going connection ... which means that the program is n't even getting so far as to attempt to get a connection !!< br /> BUG CITY < br />< br /> I again explain that their software ca n't phone home even without the windoze firewall on ( which it is n't usually anyways ) or my Antivirus firewall disabled and that I even found out how to turn of the SPI firewall on my wireless router off . All to no avail .< br />< br /> So the weekend passes and after a very busy Monday I check my e-mails and NOTHING , NADA no response from their tech &# 34 ; support &# 34 ; whatsoever ..< br />< br /> I have uninstalled this program ( Which by the way also installed a service called &# 34 ; Protexis ) Thanks for yet another TSR hardware drain !< br />< br /> Thank god AMAZON is reasonable enough to let me return this CRAP software !!< br />< br /> DO NOT BUY !!!!! !#### #### ####[([1], [290], 'NEG')]

We were very happy with Peachtree ( now Sage ) accounting software which we used for 20 + years . We had some questions and after waiting for hours on hold , we were told we should update , so in August of 2014 we bought the updated latest version . Right from the start , we had many problems . We are a small business with gross sales of under $ 1,000,000 . Suddenly , System Cost Adjustments began appearing in our financial statements , for 1st for $ 293,000 , then for $ 4,239,987 . Sage was unable to provide any assistance at all , telling us that these entries were made automatically and telling us we had to buy an annual Sage Support package , the cheapest of which was $ 649.00 . I believe there was a virus in the software . Sage provided no solution to our dilemma . Even our accountant was perplexed by the crazy figures and spent many hours fixing the problem . We decided to move to another accounting program . After using Peachtree / Sage for so many years , the transition was painful . However , the problems caused by Sage were enormous and beyond our ability to fix , and apparently beyond Sage 's capabilities to fix either .#### #### ####[([76, 77], [141], 'NEG'), ([144], [59], 'NEG'), ([144], [141], 'NEG')]

So it is months later and do I like it now ? No. I absolutely despise it and the horse it rode in on . I can say that I am more or less used to 8.1 but getting there was a huge productivity killer , so many internet queries , &# 34 ; Where did they put create a system image ?&# 34 ; , etc . Worse , Microsoft keeps on nagging me to upgrade to Win 10 . I spent half a morning learning how to kill their pestering . Do I have anything good to say about Win 8.1 ? No , nope , nyet , nada , zip . Getting rid of all the crapware and Microsoft store clutter took too long . There should be a &# 34 ; decrappify my new PC &# 34 ; switch . Apple OS 's are n't any better so your best bet is a Linux distro and Libraoffice . I use Knoppix , but for my next machine I might start with UBUTU . BTW out of the blue office stopped working on my win 7 pc a few days ago . Reinstalling did not help . What happened ? It looks like some sort of maintenance failed and corrupted it . Win 10 stuff ? What I wrote when I was first using Win 8.1 : Tried it , hate it , a bucket of tar . You ca n't swim , you ca n't tread water , you only sink . I 've been using Microsoft releases ( and numerous other operating systems since DOS . Most were small increments of frustration , new bugs and a few new goofy features , but not Win 8 . It is just plain ugly . So what is wrong with those executives at MS ? Why do they feel compelled to make us learn a new way to do the same thing every three years ? I have two machines , a slow old Win 7 machine and a screaming fast new Win 8 PC . The fast machine has an SSD , tons of memory , fast i7 processor and so on . Boots in a flash and then I try to do anything , and Win 8 's new &# 34 ; features &# 34 ; stop me dead in my tracks . I spend the day querying the internet reading solutions from other unhappy Win 8 users . ( BTW , I am a computer professional who has used numerous other operating systems . I give this one the prize for being the most annoying . ) Does anyone like Win 8 you ask ? The Win 8 project manager who should be sent toSiberia ? I have a job to do and buying a fast PC slows me down because of Win 8 . Often I boot the old Win 7 machine just so I can get my work done . Bottom line , do not buy Win 8 and pray that Win 10 is better or for a sure bet , find a copy of Win 7 . Wish I had a spare , I 'd blow away Win 8 faster than you can say SSD .#### #### ####[([145], [296], 'NEG'), ([145], [360], 'NEG'), ([144, 145], [360], 'NEG')]

Delighted with this latest version of Home Designer , it 's the third time I 've purchased this product beginning with the one I used to create my own custom home ( 3D renderings completed in 2005 ) . As an interior designer , this is a key tool of mine used on my client 's behalf as , after all , so many folks have trouble visualizing , so it 's ideal for this application of test-driving various space planning and / or design concepts on paper. < br />< br /> But as a pre-build tool , it ca n't be beat . And as a result of the [ voluminous !] hours I spent designing and planning my own residence ( including placing all key furnishings ) , we had zero change orders during my home 's construction . As an aside , I 'd spent so much time in my virtual home that when the walls finally went up and the sheetrock was installed ... it already felt eerily familiar (!).< br />< br /> The how-to tutorial 's are definitely worth viewing as things are not necessarily intuitive , especially if you 've never used a program of this sort before . Wanted to mention that I ran into a problem this time as it turned out my Dell desktop did n't have a dedicated graphics card , so the output of . jpgs ( for clients ) was n't what it needed to be -- had never realized this when buying the computer . So I did have to purchase and have a graphics card installed ( the one I got was specifically designed for my model of Dell for 3D programs ) -- resulting in an extra headache and expense I had n't planned on . But it all worked out and now I 'm super happy with the caliber of final graphics from the 3D mode. < br />< br /> Lastly , I have to compliment and congratulate the Chief Architect team of tech support . Because of discovering this graphics issue ( the &# 34 ; final review &# 34 ; feature would n't even load ) and another question about only wanting wallpaper on some but not all walls in a given room I was designing , I made several calls to them following my purchase . They were SO nice , prompt , and knowledgeable -- wish I could put them in a clone machine for so many other companies whose tech support feels like I 've either landed in the land of robots .... or alternately am stuck w / techno-nincompoops ! On the wallpaper issue which also included a second crown molding which mysteriously appeared and I could n't deactivate , I was able to route the file for plan itself via their support interface , and within less than a day received a detailed reply back showing me by screenshot exactly what to do where to achieve the desired results . Just PERFECT in my book . And really warm , lovely , articulate folks with a genuine spirit of helpfulness to boot , a Very positive experience for this end user. < br />< br /> FYI , my graphics card exercise cost $ 117 for the part ( incl. shpg. ) and I paid my local Staples $ 39 to install it . Happy all 's upgraded now and I also highly recommend the manufacturer catalogue downloads , especially if you 're in the building trades like I am -- although do be aware some of them have ginormous file sizes. < br />< br /> Overall , SO pleased and delighted with this software purchase and , after over a decade of using earlier versions plus these most recent tech support encounters , I 'm surely a loyal Chief Architect fan for life ! !#### #### ####[([230, 231], [243, 244], 'POS'), ([230, 231], [605], 'POS')]

AmitBarnwal lists many helpful pros and cons of Mathematica 10 . I would add to his list that for those working in Graph Theory and Combinatorics , it 's still a major disappointment . Mathematica owes its very existence to its ease of use , and that simplicity rests upon its documentation . Typically , there are lots of detailed examples illustrating a wide range of applications and pitfalls , and for most commands they do an outstanding job . An unfortunate and glaring exception is the command MinimumSpanningTree , which incorporates methods that have become exponentially important in the past decade . Their documentation for this command is so inadequate and the few , pathetic examples are so trivial that their perfunctory explanations are completely useless . They have now included this command in several versions of Mathematica , and I 've waited patiently for their documentation to improve , but it has n't . In fact , in this version they state simply that MinimumSpanningTree has been replaced by FindSpanningTree . This is appalling . Mathematica developers need to spend less time creating bloatware by adding hundreds of functions and combining them into more and more unwieldy packages , and instead spend more time improving their documentation to make their existing commands more useful . Mathematica seems to have been constructed by geeks who were born after 1990 and know absolutely nothing about good business practices .#### #### ####[([43], [41], 'NEG'), ([104], [110], 'NEG'), ([166], [110], 'NEG'), ([166], [175], 'NEG'), ([166], [215], 'NEG'), ([171], [175], 'NEG'), ([171], [215], 'NEG'), ([208], [32], 'NEG'), ([208], [215], 'NEG')]

This is a fantastic photo editing program . It easily rivals Adobe Photoshop @ 1 / 5 the cost . This program comes with great bonus additions and add ons . My only criticism is that the users manual has to be down loaded and printed out and it 's nearly 900 pages long . this post processing program is by far the greatest value in a software program that I have ever seen .

The poor rating is due to sending of a product previously known to be defective . Norton deserves a five-star as I have been repeatedly using their products since 1996. < br />< br /> This was just a product key but the product key was defective . My first attempt to have this corrected returned the Indian sub-continent response to follow the instructions on the back of the card with the product key which obviously did not work or I otherwise would not have had to contact them concerning the defective product key . I had even explained the additional steps and troubleshooting to confirm that the issue was with an invalid product key but apparently she lacked either the English skills or technical knowledge to understand the issue. < br />< br /> The next day I used the option to have someone call me . This person admitted that they had problems with a series of product keys and would send one to me without having to go the return route . He stated that he had tried same-day delivery but that it was too late in the day so it was sent next-day delivery . It was sent next-day but USPS meaning that if and when they get around to it the product will appear in the mailbox , which it did late in the afternoon. < br />< br /> Bottom line is that I was unable to use the product for nearly two days while waiting for a valid product key to arrive and my request to have a product key emailed instead was not answered. < br />< br /> Product :< br />< br /> I have never had a problem with Norton slowing down any system that I have owned and this is no exception even when being used on an eight-year old computer . The only slowdowns ever experienced are when I run scans without having the option set to run in background although I admit to not even looked for this setting in the current version .#### #### ####[([43, 44], [46], 'NEG'), ([43, 44], [91], 'NEG'), ([43, 44], [112], 'NEG'), ([43, 44], [154], 'NEG'), ([43, 44], [254], 'NEG'), ([43, 44], [291, 292], 'NEG')]

I 've been using this software since 1994 . Back then it was called Peachtree Accounting for Windows . I think it was version 1 . It was buggy , poorly written , annoying , but it did the job better than anything else that my small business could afford . Since then they have continued to add mostly useless features , but have done very little to fix bugs . The user interface is poor and inconsistent . It was written before current Windows standards and has never been re-written . Make no mistake : in my opinion , if you buy this you 'll be using software that has n't changed substantially since 1994. < br /> That said , a few years ago I tried to switch to Quickbooks and found it worse . I no longer remember what it could n't do , but I decided to stick with Peachtree . Sorry Sage , I still think of it as Peachtree . If you thought you would somehow dodge the lousy reputation by changing the name , forget it . Instead why do n't you improve the product ? It would be a big job to recode the whole thing , but you 'd be left with a great product instead of a 3 star one . Do n't build more features , do n't try to replace real bookkeeping with useless automated tools , just give us good solid basic accounting which meets Windows standards .#### #### ####[([225], [59], 'NEU'), ([60], [59], 'NEU'), ([72, 73], [75], 'NEU'), ([72, 73], [77], 'NEU')]

A passable introduction to programming in Visual Basic . NET , with an author that ' s clearly skilled and pleasant to listen to , but with some major flaws . First of all , I understand the strategy of explaining even the basics of the language with a desktop style program instead of a boring console application , though I am not totally sold on it . I am not totally sure that learning the basics of the language in the midst of buttons and controls won ' t obscure and weaken the foundation of understanding that a good programmer need , but then again , maybe I am just old school. < br /> But if you choose to teach the fundamental of the language in a graphic framework , at least have the decency to do so in a modern one , like windows apps or at least WPF , not the jurassic windows forms. . Yes , I know , they are simple , but they are so obsolete now !< br /> Also , I would explain both the graphic framework and the language together as we go along , not make a long , boring overview of the window forms controls , that besides killing all the excitement in learning a programming language also make little sense if you do it before you know what a class or an even is. .< br /> Finally , I think the videos are too short . They range from 3 to 8 minutes , and I think the average student need more time to &# 34 ; get in the zone &# 34 ; , so I think they should be longer and some of them should be woven together . I find the constant switching from one short video to the next to be quite an annoyance and disruptive for and efficient learning process. < br /> This said , if you concentrate and pay attention and try your hand at the exercises that the author proposes ( I love this part ) you will end up with a reasonable understanding of the fundamentals of Visual Basic . The subject is explained clearly , and the choice of arguments is reasonable , though I think object oriented features should be emphasized more. < br /> At least the depth of this tutorial series is serious and not totally amateurish like the &# 34 ; Visual Basic Essential Training &# 34 ; series from Lynda.coml Basic Essential Training &# 34 ; series from Lynda.com#### #### ####[([184, 185], [248], 'NEU'), ([184, 185], [375], 'NEU')]
Great suite , with an easy-to-use interface . . BitDefender offers excellent antivirus and browser / antiphising protection based on numerous independent lab tests .

I changed back from the new version of the Mac Tree Maker to the classic form because the new version has a number of glitches as reported by others . They are working 24 / 7 to improve matters according to the call-in person when I complained . The new version has many nice glitzy features but I preferred the classic form for usability . For example , if one looks for media such as “ comments ” they are found under “ tools ” for some reason . For my tree , some of the most important parts were the “ stories &# 34 ; explaining the rationale for decision making in constructing certain parts of a tree . This is very important because often there is little basis for supporting the existence of an alleged ancestor . &# 34 ; Comments and and stories ” are needed for perspective . Too often , erroneous information is copied many times over and becomes fact in time . Unfortunately the stories were not present in the new version thus my giving the evaluation a one star .

Due to poor customer service , I recommend prospective customers to keep that in mind when considering this product and act accordingly. < br />< br /> Update : Even though I could not install or use the software , they charged my credit card renewal fees one year after first purchase. < br /> This is the worst company in the world .

Macgourmet Deluxe worked well for several years , but recently the import feature stopped working . Upon contacting the developer , they told me the import is very complicated and time-consuming to fix , but they are working on it . After several weeks , I contacted them again and they said that the import feature in MGD3 was outsourced to a third-party that stopped supporting their software , but if I upgrade to MGD4 it should work again . I do n't mind upgrading to gain functionality , but I actually liked MGD3 and would rather get Paprika for $ 20 then pay $ 25 to upgrade , particularly when it may &# 34 ; stop &# 34 ; working again in the future if MGD5 ever comes out .#### #### ####[([25], [28], 'NEG'), ([25], [30], 'NEG')]

I had posted a review before on this saying that it was the worst , i was wrong . There was a problem with my harddrive . I had recently bought a new harddrive 2TB and it worked fast . I was mistaken . Microsoft you do well . Only thing i hate about the new Windows 10 is that they spy on everything you do . Big Brother ? no thanks Microsoft .

I 'm a graduate student with a refurbished Dell Latitude E5430 , a laptop PC . I bought this software because my computer came with a free trial of Trend Micro -- the free trial worked noticeably well -- its positive reviews , and its low price . You can set it up to rate links as safe or unsafe ( for example , if you google search something , the software goes through the search results and puts green check marks next to safe sites and red x 's next to dangerous ones ) . At first , I was dubious about the validity of the ratings because it seemed to mark everything as safe . However , I do see red x 's next to sites that are known to be infected with viruses . Will have to review again when the semester ends but so far so good .#### #### ####[([41], [40], 'POS')]

I 'm so glad I did n't purchase this crap ( and that 's exactly what it is -- CRAP !) . I bought a Memorex external CD burner for my laptop and installed the Nero 2014 software on my computer . Today , I tried to unsuccessfully burn music and I could n't figure out what the problem was . I created an account , activated the link that was sent to me via email ... and after several attempts , I was never able to sign into my account . I created a playlist so I could burn a CD and when I clicked on the &# 34 ; burn &# 34 ; icon , a window popped up asking if I wanted to create an audio CD or an MP3 CD . After clicking audio CD on several attempts , nothing happened to show that the CD was burning . I even tried to burn the CD through Nero Express and a window popped up saying that Nero Express was a trial version that expires next month and I 'd have to buy the software . If I purchase a device , the software should be free as long as you can do the basic stuff like burn CDs , organize your files , etc . If it 's advanced , then of course you should pay for it . This software is absolutely ridiculous . I used Nero a long time ago when I had a desktop computer in 2000 or 2001 and I did n't experience this much frustration and aggravation . This crap will be removed from my computer immediately . If you 're looking for burning software , definitely pass this one up .#### #### ####[([234], [199], 'NEG'), ([234], [237], 'NEG')]

Installed on a Dell E310 with a new 1Tb hard drive . Works fine . Very easy , menu driven install . Took about 30 mins . I chose &# 34 ; Custom &# 34 ; set-up . Note it 's the operating system and Explorer . Does n't come with anything else - like the junk when you buy a new system - which to me is refreshing. < br />< br /> I purchased from a 3rd party seller with fulfillment by Amazon . Looks legit , CD with hologram , in a plain , sealed pack . Product key was small font like on the back of a credit card but perfectly legible . It registered fine with Microsoft. < br />< br /> Be patient . It 's SP1 so it took 193 updates and several hours to update after the first power off . Then 75 updates later in the day at about the 5th power off and 30 updates at power off after the first night. < br />< br /> The new system found the drive , video card , and CD drive . Had to download the sound card driver . Only had one minor glitch - I had a second drive which I disconnected for the install and upon start-up , I got a , &# 34 ; Drive 1 not found . Hit F1 to continue , F2 to set-up. &# 34 ; message . For now , I just went F2 to set-up and turned off drive 1 - problem solved .

We 'll see how Win 10 works out . Do some real research before plunking down almost $ 100 , though . Anything running on the NT Kernel is simply not going to be as stable , fast , nor as secure as a Unix-like OS such as Apple 's or a Linux distro . There 's a lot of work involved keeping Windows healthy , too . I 've gladly sold off the last license & disc of Windows I had ( this version ) and can find absolutely no reason to miss it . All five computers in our house - and two at my wife 's small business - now run Ubuntu or a fork of Ubuntu ( my personal desktop runs Mint 17.1 ) . The kids have too many games they 've gotten from their Steam accounts to miss their old Windows games . LibreOffice is free and does anything we could do with MS Office . GIMP is different , but I can &# 34 ; Photo Shop &# 34 ; my pictures to death , and again for free . My Android 's Linux , as is my router - and probably every server I port through on the Net .

This software proved to be just what I imagined . At first I was concerned that the version would not be compatible with win 8.1 but downloaded from the cd correctly . However it did not immediately establish an icon so that I could access the Kontact2 player . I had to go to the file and right click on it where a window dropped down asking me if I wanted to search for an update . Upon clicking that window the icon in the player changed to a new icon in the file and then established an icon on my task bar of win 8.1 . After that it was clear sailing .

This is the original game and the main problem with it is that you need an ancient computer to play it on as it has 16 bit resolution that wo n't be resolved with anything past Windows 95 . The other thing I dislike about it is in the game itself where the Council , without warning , votes you out of the game . That can be frustrating , especially if you were building your countries and developing your armies and thought you were doing well and suddenly the game is over . This game has the dreadnoughts and tanks that Imperialism 2 lacks . This is my favorite computer strategy game because it does n't require all the clicking and swordplay and gunplay and endless calculations per turn that generally every game requires nowadays . This is more or less a painless Risk . You have to develop your countries and armies but it 's not overly time consuming per turn . A nice mindless , relaxing way to spend some time .#### #### ####[([25, 26], [8], 'NEU')]

Product performed as advertised . Tried using the Windows Transfer method to transfer the files and programs from a Windows 7 to 8.1 computer.and all it did was transfer the files . Ordered the Laplink PCMover for $ 14.95 and 2 days later it arrived by UPS at 7:00 PM that evening . By 8:00 PM the transfer was in operation and I could go do other things . It allowed several transfer methods including direct cable but since my two computers were in different rooms I selected the wireless transfer . The transfer speed was phenomenal . I was able to transfer 22 GB of data in about 3 - 4 hours . I was able to install the software on both computers and transfer the programs by 12:00 am that night , of course I did n't stay up to watch it . It even notified me by email or text message that the operation was complete . I had no problems with the programs that transferred and it identified up front those that would n't transfer . The software was very easy to use and you could select all the programs , files and most settings using a simple and easy to follow user interface . I highly recommend this program if you are upgrading or transferring the PROGRAMS and files from one computer to another .

I give the title 5 stars . Counter-Strike is a great game , always has been , always will be . Why do I give the game 1-star ? Because they introduced Cases . Gambling . Spend $ 2.49 for a key to open a case for a 1 in a million chance to open a $ 2,000 skin , or for a 99.99 % chance to open up a 5 cent skin . This is a video game . Not a Casino . If I want a cool gun skin , I should be able to achieve it , not have to buy it for $ 2,000 or spend $ 5,000 on cases to get one .

For a couple of years , I did n't have access to this amazing product . OH HAPPY DAY ! DVO came up with the Mac version. < br /> I love it ! Can I say again , I LOVE IT ! I have it on my Mac Book , iPhone , and iPad . I can capture recipes from my food blogs and any I find. < br /> Thank you for the Mac version. < br /> I recently had a problem with capturing my Pinterest boards . I worked closely with Technical support and we figured it out ! I can only capture 20 recipes from my board at a time , but it works !!< br /> Not sure why the negative reviews !

I have been using DVO Cook'n Recipe Organizer for a number of years now and through several upgrades can say that I do n't know what I would do without it to keep my recipes organized in categories . Not only can I add my personal recipes but this version will recommend popular recipe downloads and search the internet for recipes for me and then allow me to automatically save them in the program . After a computer operating system upgrade my Cook'n program was n't working correctly so I emailed the company and got a response within several hours that included an apology for my problem , clear instructions and a link for a new download along with a personal comment to let their representative know if I had any other problems . I have used computers for many years and have never enjoyed the level of customer service I have experienced with Cook'n . I have contacted them in the past with questions and have always received a personal response . I highly recommend Cook'n not only for the quality and capability of the program but also for the amazing customer support . And , did I mention that my recipes automatically sync across my computer , iPad and iPhone so even if I am out I can check a recipe to see if I need to pick something up from the store !

Grandma has been using it a few times a week . Overall it worked much better than any other similar software we tried. < br /> The speed on my HP laptop running Windows 8 is okay .

I have been working with ATO Deluxe 14 for a few months on a PC running Windows 7 . I needed to begin using ATO on my home laptop running Windows 8.1 , but the backup file failed to open there . I contacted tech support and maybe it was a slow day , but they generated a service ticket within an hour . Via email , they walked me through a few suggestions , but those did not solve the problem . The technician asked me to send him my backup file which he then doctored somehow and sent back a couple of days later .

Microsoft managed to destroy a great product with Windows 8 because Streets and Trips 2013 , which I use everyday , now self corrupts , checks the internet for &# 34 ; licensing &# 34 ; issues and FREQUENTLY stops working . An error message pops up announcing that fact ( Error Code : 0xC004D301 ) and advises the customer to call Microsoft to address the issue . Then an elaborate fix is required , which usually involves Microsoft 's Reset Tool , which may or may not be available ( going on 4 days waiting now for an upgrade for the Reset Tool to become available for the fix ) and a heavily accented Microsoft Support person most likely residing in India and 45-90 minutes . In a couple of weeks or months , or some random period of time , you get to do it all over again .

I wish I had read these reviews prior to my purchase of this product . It appears that this product works for about 75 % of users , but I , unfortunately , appear to be in that 25 % . I bought the &# 34 ; ultra &# 34 ; version of &# 34 ; powerDVD &# 34 ; ( retail box w / disc ) for my win 8 machine and played maybe 4 movies in the first year . Since I have several other entertainment systems , I rarely watched movies on my computer . I then decided to watch a blu-ray a couple of weeks ago and guess what ? Just like all these other folks , it would n't load to 100 % , always stopped at 99 % and the product froze . I had to reboot , or end the task in taskmanager just to get it to stop and release my desktop . So , just like all the responses to the posts on here , I did open a case , provided all the info , including all the diag info and a detailed description of the issue ( when the blu-ray is loading , there is a dialogue box that opens with a load progress bar expressed in % . When the progress reaches 99 % , the product freezes / becomes unresponsive and the drive stops spinning . It remains in that state indefinitely until windows intervenes and indicates that the product is not responding and asks if I want to wait or close . Even then , that progress dialogue box remains stuck on the desktop which requires a restart of the system to get rid of , or ending the task CLHELPER in the task manager ) that was requested and got a response ... asking for error codes and more info as it they are trying to make it more difficult than it needs to be , especially in light of the fact that in my detailed description of the issue , I clearly stated that the dang product FROZE , which means nothing else happens beyond that , no error code , no nothing ! Whoever the support person who responded to me knows nothing about the product and only serves to frustrate me further . If anyone out there knows of a reliable media product that will play blu-ray , let me know. < br />< br /> Nobody should pay good money and then have to engage in a bunch of technical nonsense to get the thing to work . A significant % of product owners have had these issues , that should be a red flag for Cyberlink . I really wish I had read these other reviews :(#### #### ####[([235], [236, 237], 'NEG')]

Product is good . 2 teens and 2 parents and 0 viruses in 3 years using it . We game online , watch videos , etc ... with no apparent affect on speed .

I ca n't tell that this is a big huge improvement over Dragon 12.5 in fact there is certain functionalities lost , and I find them very annoying . I 'm considering uninstalling Dragon 13 and reinstalling Dragon 12 , In particular is the correction menu function in unsupported applications like Thunderbird ( Mozilla based e-mail client ) you just get the Dragon message &# 34 ; no matching text found &# 34 ; but if you are using the Dictation Box then the function works perfectly . Mostly a hassle in the addressing field , if you say the name of the recipient and it guesses wrong ( using the wrong spelling ) you cannot say &# 34 ; correct that &# 34 ; and see the other options . Think twice before upgrading !#### #### ####[([45], [20], 'NEU'), ([45], [27], 'NEU'), ([45], [86], 'NEU'), ([45], [90], 'NEU'), ([45], [111], 'NEU')]
A so called &# 34 ; upgraded MAC operating system &# 34 ; no longer supported my Microsoft Office for MAC software . I had lost all of my e-mail messages , including some important documents . I was advised in an on-line technical Chat session to purchase Microsoft Office Mac Home & Student to replace my e-mail software and retrieve my mail messages . The Microsoft Office Mac Home & Student software that I purchased from Amazon did not include the e-mail component which was the primary purpose for purchasing the suite . I thought the suite included Microsoft Word , Power Point , Excel , and Entourage ( or comparable e-mail ) for MAC . I also thought I was also getting a CD . Instead , I was given a code for downloading the software , which did not work . I contacted Apple tech support on-line for assistance and was advised that because I purchased the software from a 3rd party vendor ( Amazon ) , Apple could not assist in the download . I was also told that the origin of the software was an out-of-country source with a code that was not compatible for in-country downloading . It was then that I was told that the software also did not include the e-mail component of the suite . Total loss. < br /> I had to purchase the Microsoft Office for Home & Business version of the software for an additional $ 219.99 to get the software which included the e-mail component . However , I had to purchase the software from Microsoft , not Apple to get the technical support needed for the download . Each time I attempted to access the Microsoft site , somehow Apple would re-direct my browser to the Apple Store ! Frustrating . I had to completely shut down my computer , wait for several minutes and re-boot before I was allowed to access the Microsoft site . Once I got to Microsoft , I had to work my way to their &# 34 ; MAC Department &# 34 ; where I bought the correct software and was able to download it . Once it was downloaded , I discovered that I could not access my e-mail. < br /> A Microsoft technician attemptedto load my archived e-mail but the system crashed and in the meantime he had to leave for the day . The next morning Microsoft jettisoned me to their technical support office in the Philippines . A technician advised me to disregard the archived mail on my computer and re-open an account with the prior Internet carrier . She contacted the carrier , and they agreed . Again , we ran out of time . Next day I contacted the Philippine tech support office and was bluntly told by a technician to forget it , I would never be able to retrieve my mail . It was gone in cyber space forever . Then the phone connection went dead. < br /> I happened to glance down at my computer screen . My e-mail account was open . It was loading messages ... loading and loading ... message after message ! It was retrieving my lost mail ... all the way back to 2006 ! Holy Cow ! The first Philippine technician was right ... And the Microsoft Office for Home & Business e-mail software did work ! I contacted the old Internet Carrier and asked to keep the e-mail account open . &# 34 ; There is a $ 4.95 monthly charge ,&# 34 ; the rep replied . &# 34 ; Let 's do it !&# 34 ; , I responded . So it is . I am grateful for &# 34 ; Divine Intervention &# 34 ; ! All is forgiven ... but not forgotten . I am sharing my &# 34 ; lessons learned &# 34 ; not to harm but to enlighten those who may encounter a similar problem and perhaps , help avoid a similar experience. < br /> I am very pleased with most of my purchases from Amazon . They are have high quality merchandise , good delivery , and very reasonable prices . This is the first time I 've experienced a problem .

Norton is a good anti virus , but their customer service is the pits . I had an occasion where I had to restore my computer , this caused Norton to scramble , I went to the Norton site ( since you cannot get a disk from Norton ) and was told to uninstall Norton which I did , on the completion of the uninstall there was noting instructing me as to how to reinstall . I signed back onto the Norton site and chose the chat function , and waited 29 minutes to chat with a technician . Then 3 hours later the tech was able to get Norton back onto my computer .

It works . And if all you 're looking for is that , you 're going to be fine . But its a resource hog , and does n't play well with Firefox . Major slowdowns , lengthy boot-ups .

BAD , VERY BAD , AND WORSE THAN VERY BAD < br /> PURE UGLY - I bought Bitdefender 3PCs / 2Years from Amazon , originally to get rid of products like it . And Bitdefender , in my experience , is among the very worst. < br />< br /> Bitdefender first threatened to turn off their product after one year , on a two year 3 PC license agreement . They did this through one of the most irritating string of banner pop-up ads I have yet encountered. < br />< br /> Then , a year later , as the two-year license was really about to expire , they renewed the nettlesome pop-ups . These ads , in addition to being frequent and large , had a clever twist , when the big red kill X was selected , the ads merely sent more pop-ups. < br />< br /> Then after multiple attempts to uninstall Bitdefender using Windows 8 &# 34 ; Programs and Features &# 34 ; uninstall , it would n't uninstall. < br />< br /> When remove is selected within Bitdefender , instead of removing the program , it sends more ads. < br /> Your computer , your choice. < br /> Getting through to Bitdefender , through their website or other search means , is impossible. < br /> Bitdefender , if you are listening , or for that matter , if you even care , any comments ? Please send them to albackus @ gmail.com. < br /> Today is July 4 , 2015 . I ’ll be updating this report with when and if Bitdefender responds. < br /> UPDATE < br /> Today is July 17 , 2015 .

The user interface is over stylized for a different look from last year 's version , but ends up being counter intuitive because it does n't follow standard conventions . The result is much more time than usual to figure out where to do things and how . Imagine your disk crashed in part and you are having to restore some files . This is an anxious state of affairs . This is not the time to spend figuring out how to use something you are only going to use rarely , hopefully . Ca n't find something ? Try right clicking on mouse . No use , there is no right click menu . There is no internal search function for files . I see a button for backup , but not for restore . Where is it ? Where is it ? Looking ? Surprise ! It 's on the other side of the window . It is almost as if they made things more confusing than necessary so they can get more support requests from already anxious users . If you click away from the downloading splash box to another selection on the box , surprise , not only does your restore halt , but so do all the settings you made .

On the web , there are multiple forums with complaints and unanswered questions about activating and transferring Adobe photo-related products . I bought PE 13 last week , and it took me two days to activate it . The screens that show up once the software is installed are poorly written and misleading . They state that you are not connected to the internet when you are . If you try activate offline , you are asked for a request code with no instruction on how to get it . Technical support is only by chat , and in a painfully slow process I found the support person had no useful instructions and not a clue about this not-uncommon problem . I finally found the right instructions in an Amazon review by Chewthrutherestraints on April 28 , 2015. < br />< br /> I have been using PE since version 2 , I like using PE , but I ca n't recommend this product and I 'll be very cautious about buying other Adobe Cloud-related products that use the same validating system .#### #### ####[([39], [49, 50], 'NEG'), ([39], [52], 'NEG')]

Was pretty much a 1-click backup as advertised but that was the only reason for 2 stars . The down side ( that I can see of the 1-click backup ) is it does n't give you any options as to the backup name and the directory you want them to go to ( like on an external usb drive ) . From what I experienced , it put in it 's own created directory under it 's own created name . I made secondary backups trying to name it and direct it , which after wards it did n't seem to recognize as a valid backup . I have n't yet needed or tried to restore from the backups I created . Honestly , I do n't know if I 'll be able to restore my PC or not . I had Acronis TI 9 and absolutely loved it .

Annoying things about QuickBooks Pro 2015 ...< br />< br />* Just sat through an upgrade to the software , and an upgrade to the databases ... Takes a long time - why 'd they upgrade the databases ? What changed so much that it required the data format to be updated ? Or is it more forced upgrade nonsense ?< br />< br />* They changed the screens - not to add more information , but just to move stuff around . Really annoying. < br />< br />* The bottom part of the shortcut bar is stolen for some inane advertising &# 34 ; Do More With QuickBooks &# 34 ; . You ca n't hide it or delete it ( well , unless you hack your HOSTS file and fool with an HTML file in the program ) . This stinks . I paid for this upgrade , and they steal my screen space . Not cool Intuit . Not cool at all. < br />< br />* The emailed invoices get sent out in HTML format - so if you use Thunderbird , the damn thing shows you the HTML code if you have your prefs in Tbird set to PLAIN TEXT ... No way to disable this HTML pseudo-functionality . This is n't how it worked previously , so they BROKE IT. < br />< br /> Bad enough we have to be forced to upgrade , but when they break things and steal from us - that 's when I take exception. < br />< br /> Wonder how long it 'll take for them to be sued ?#### #### ####[([96], [101], 'NEG'), ([96], [0], 'NEG'), ([96], [98], 'NEG')]

Have had every version of Photoshop Elements since 4 ( which was probably the most fun version made ) . I 'm really disappointed in this one . It looks like back to basic Photoshop ( the free version ) with some perks tossed in . Not great for editing photos . I 'll still be using 6 or 9 for that .

Ok so i was a little hesitant purchasing because I saw older reviews referring to issue when used with windows 7 . I decided to try it anyway when I saw it at a great price and figured It could return if absolutely necessary . I installed it on my windows 7 64 bit without issue and it runs great . It looks fun and engaging from the few minutes I took checking it out , exploring it a bit . I distinctly remember arguing with my typing teacher in school saying i 'll never need to know this but thankfully I kept at it and in today 's age it 's an invaluable skill so I 'm excited to find a fun way to teach my son . Regarding the comments with install issues .... I do n't know if they made a new version of this or what , but my box has a copyright of 2014 and the system requirements state it works with windows 8 , 7 , vista , or xp . Hopefully it will work on windows 10 when I upgrade soon :)#### #### ####[([19, 20], [59], 'POS'), ([58], [59], 'POS')]

As I 'm very close to my real world insturment checkride , I decided to give X plane a second try , along with significantly upgrading my PC to I7-4790K . I 'd previously tried ver 9 demo , not thrilled but still later the full program ... still not thrilled with either the flight dynamics or ( significant lack of ) scenery and poor navigation instrumentation . How &# 34 ; real &# 34 ; was that as they 'd advertised . So a few years later with my IFR , I realized that Microsoft FSX did not update the GPS database and research led me to believe that X-Plane had great ATC and GPS approaches. . at least that 's what their website advertised . Not so ... ATC communication is mostly background gibberish and certainly does not tie in to my real world frequencies ( NY Class B area ) . The GPS actually leaves out the approaches I am practicing. . approaches the 10 yr old FSx has . And then I read that updates require a subscription service no less. . that would also update good old FSX anyway , which flies more realistically at least with the stock C172 . Sure FSX is looking a bit outdated. . X plane has fantastically realistic clouds and terrestrial scenery while sparse , looks &# 34 ; real &# 34 ; , but for VFR practice , FSX scenery plants the landmarks you need. . and for IFR , well I ca n't be fighting the unrealistic controls all the time. . I need to practice &# 34 ; procedures &# 34 ; , right ... timing , radios , GPS inputs , etc . it 's almost impossible in X plane. . at least in the 2 C172 versions I 've struggled with . Add to that procedures not even existing ... damn these guys anger me . I hate that they get away with this . I hate to return the product because it hurts Amazon , the vendor and consumers in the end . Back to FSX for me along with a subscription service to update the GPS and hopefully charts .#### #### ####[([54, 55], [49, 50], 'NEG'), ([65, 66], [64], 'NEG'), ([65, 66], [157, 158], 'NEG')]

My daughter is a photographer , and right after editing some wedding photos her macbook pro crashed . Her next step would have been to back them up on an external drive and burn them to a disc , but due to the crash she could n't do that . We took the laptop to an apple store but were told it would be 14 working days before they could even look at her laptop . We then took it to a local repair shop and they said they could recover the data in 5 days . After paying $ 125 , we realized that none of the stuff she really needed , including the wedding photos were recovered . Through amazon , I purchased a new hard drive that my son installed to get her computer running again . Next , I purchased some hardware / cables to be able to connect the old , bare hard drive to my computer to see if it would mount , it did not . I then searched for recovery software online and found Stellar Phoenix . I decided to run a scan , mainly searching for photos , videos and audio . It took over 3 days , not good ! Once done , it showed folders named &# 34 ; jpg &# 34 ; , &# 34 ; tiff &# 34 ; &# 34 ; png &# 34 ; etc , which you can click on and get a small preview window to see the file , unless it was over 10 mb , which the wedding photos would have been . The next step was to &# 34 ; recover &# 34 ; the files . When I selected that option , it went to another window and asked for the registration key , which of course I did not have , so you were prompted to purchase the software for $ 99 . After wasting 3 days scanning , I was expected to complete the purchase without knowing if it even recovered the files we were after , not good ! So I googled recovery software for mac reviews and found that Data Rescue 4 was the highest rated option . I decided to try it and within 5 minutes , I was downloading the wedding photos ! There was an option to search for the files by name , which I used to find the folder she had all the wedding photos in . Can you imagine my daughter 's relief not having to tell her client that she lost all the wedding photos ? Thanks to Data Rescue 4 , mom was the hero of the day !#### #### ####[([30, 31], [126], 'POS'), ([127, 128], [126], 'POS')]
I have been using cookn for almost two years and use it quite extensively . I especially like how easy it is to import receipts from a variety of locations without any or very little keyboarding .

Until recently I was not a Cook'n Club member which is supposed to give me first attention with any problem I have had with Cook'n but honestly , I have found their support staff excellent . They have always responded to my question and all problems have been resolved in a timely manner . My husband , who has Cook'n on his Ipad , has had some issues . I do my work on a laptop .

Honestly , the interface is a huge pain . The editing tools feel like a vector illustration program from 20 years ago , but with more constraints and complexity due to the way it handles materials . Simple editing operations ( e.g. scaling ) are n't uniformly supported across all classes of objects ( or not supported at all ) . Many common operations ca n't be triggered manually , and instead require a magic sequence of operations that have to occur in just the right way ( e.g. generating stair returns ) . It 's insanely difficult and often impossible to create your own objects and manipulate them as groups ( e.g. add a pergola to a landscape ) . And the interface does n't make anywhere near sufficient accommodations for anything custom ( e.g. I still ca n't model my roof eaves and slope to anything near what they are in reality ) . Accepting all that , I ca n't really find anything else in the product space , so I give it a grudging three stars .#### #### ####[([3], [6, 7], 'NEU'), ([3], [97], 'NEU'), ([42], [6, 7], 'NEU'), ([42], [124, 125], 'NEU')]

I love Cook’n ! I got this software to replace an old DOS program that I got in 1992 ! I loved it as I could easily enter my own recipes . Over the years I did wonder if there was something better , and I did download a number of trial run subscriptions . None of them were as good as my old software , COOKBOOK . Two years ago along came a new computer and my old DOS program would no longer work . I was forced to find something else as I was tired getting that old computer out every time I wanted a recipe ! That is when I found Cook’n ! I watched Dan ’s demo video and said to myself “ this is the one ! ” It is the only one I reviewed where I could easily get all 300 + recipes from my old software into the new . Using the “ snip it ” tool made it very easy ! This software does so much and I have not even touched on some of the things it will do . I love it that when I see a recipe online that I would like to have , all I need to do is have Cook’n open and enter the name and I can “ capture ” it right into my software . I have had some issues that were easily resolved by the great support staff . They try to respond quickly with their easy to follow instructions and I have not had to wait long .

Lucky my credit card company just refunded me the $ 135 . Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on Sony Vegas Pro 13 . I went to SafeHarbor.com and got the Academic Vegas Pro 13 Suite on sale for $ 279 . On Sony 's website the non-academic program costs $ 800 . I contacted SafeHarbor and asked if I could purchase it because my girlfriend is a teacher , and they told me yes . All I had to do is email over a picture of her teacher ID and I saved over $ 500 . Sony allows Academic programs ( which is the same as the non-academic program , just cheaper ) to be sold to teachers or students K-College . They also allow you to purchase the program in your name for a teacher or student . You just need their ID . Let me tell you , I will never go back to Roxio . For the extra $ 150 not only is it totally worth the cost , but if I knew how good this was years ago , I would have paid full price for it before my girlfriend and I were together . It takes a little getting use to , and some things are easier in Roxio , but the things you can do with Vegas are limitless . And I have yet to have a crash . My load and save times are very quick . You can download a trial version on Sony 's website . One you do it , you wont go back . But give it a fair shot and some time . There are good youtube videos on how to do things .#### #### ####[([32], [31], 'NEG'), ([32], [349], 'NEG'), ([55], [57], 'NEG'), ([55], [68], 'NEG'), ([55], [78], 'NEG'), ([55], [218], 'NEG'), ([67], [45], 'NEG'), ([67], [57], 'NEG'), ([67], [68], 'NEG'), ([67], [81], 'NEG'), ([67], [218], 'NEG'), ([77], [57], 'NEG'), ([77], [68], 'NEG'), ([77], [78], 'NEG'), ([77], [218], 'NEG')]
The problem is not with the software but the fact that I was having trouble and there is absolutely no way to get thru to tech support to figure out the problem . Have used WP almost since it was first released and have never had any trouble with it at all . Now that I have a problem I am totally unable to resolve it .

I switched this year from TurboTax for the same reason as everyone else - but was disappointed . Its much harder to navigate to different sections , or to forms ( e.g. you can only open 1 form at a time ; they do n't link to each other , etc. ) or to return to exactly where you were up to . When opening supporting info , you have to know which line you are supporting , and the lines are sometimes misidentified in the list . The options to print out or save for your records are limited . The help is not as clear as Turbo Tax etc . All in all , its not as user-friendly . On top of all this , the program insisted on my including an explanatory statement that TT never required ( and the IRS never complained about its absence ) . Since the program does not include explanatory statements , I had to type one up separately , so the program did not let me e-file . Then , it did not let me e-file my state returns ( including a NY return , which legally must be e-filed ) because I had not e-filed the Federal return . So much for the free e-files included in the package .#### #### ####[([102], [20], 'NEG'), ([102], [99], 'NEG')]

We have been working at my company with CorelDRAW since the first version . We have tried many other packages over the years . The main competitor these days is Adobe Illustrator . CorelDRAW has every feature of Adobe Illustrator and more . The pricing & distribution model is heads above Adobe 's model ( you get to own your own copy of the software + free software upgrades ) and the technology is better . I could go on a feature list that raves about the software but I will just pick one that is the deal maker for us over Adobe . The drawing canvas in Adobe Illustrator is limited to around 20 feet . My industry ( interior & exterior signs & advertising ) often creates products that are that size or larger and CorelDRAW allows us to not have to work everything under scale , we can work at 1 to 1 size . This may not sound like a big deal but working at scale when you will be outputting to machinery adds an extra layer of complexity where things can go wrong . Again , I can go on and on but CorelDRAW is a powerful , professional , and easy yet thoroughly expandable and customizable design package . It is one of the best pieces of software I have ever had the pleasure to work with . - See more at : http :// promoter.swixhq.com / survey / pvR7DMhKRjgtxr9KVCvejNkaF /? region = us _ in _ app & swref = email & swuid = 2232 & version = 60 & recommendation = 10 # sthash.bpMTmqdE.dpuf#### #### ####[([8], [220], 'POS')]
This software produces an awesome product , however , I CANNOT recommend it , especially for anyone using a MAC . It is sold as being Mac compatible , but is not compatible with Yosemite and no timetable for getting there . Also , and most important , many of the most vital printer functions are not available because it is designed for the printer to be controlled through the Windows print manager . I bought it , but the only way it can be used is using Windows 7 through Parallels on my Mac . Clunky , buggy , but at least I 'm still in business . And their site has NO tech support FAQs , NO forums , and only a 2 hour window to reach the toll free tech department in Portugal . When I was originally trying to work out problems with the software and the Evolis printer , my only practical option was remote chat with a technician -- but I got up at 2am to do it .#### #### ####[([53, 54], [31, 32], 'NEG'), ([53, 54], [56, 57], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [31, 32], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [56, 57], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [98], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [113], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [145], 'NEG')]

I wanted to leave a review since I have found this software to be really useful . I bought this software 4-5 months back and I have managed to close about 6 deals in that time , all while using this tool for accessing and forecasting my investments . I went thru a period of 1-2 years trying to find an accounting software or tool that understood the real estate business that I was doing , and frankly there was n't one I found to meet my expectations . I ran into this by chance and boy am I glad . I use this software daily , I have 6-10 investments at any given time , and anyone on my team can see our financial position by the click of a mouse . It 's easy , it 's intuitive , and frankly looks very impressive when presenting to another investor or your colleagues . I send out reports , budget projections , etc . all from this software . It sounds difficult but it literally took me 1-2 hours to master every single facet of the software . The developer spent time in this and I am grateful . BUY BUY BUY THIS ... I AM A REAL PERSON .

Let 's get this out of the way , I skipped 7 and Vista , so I have the unique perspective of jumping from XP directly to 8.1 . What I Do n't like : App interface , I 'm saying this right now , I payed to get a PC , I want to see a PC-style desktop interface . App interfaces are for tablets , smartphone , laptops and other &# 34 ; portables &# 34 ; . Luckily 8.1 has exactly this , a way for us to have a desktop . Second dislike : Resource allocation : This goes back to the app style OS , when you open something , it continues to use resources . Considering I have 32GB of RAM , not really an issue for me , but others will be bottle-necked , so I 'm putting it out there . Third dislike : Update process . OS will start updates in sleep mode , and if it does and you come back to use your device , it will seem like it is frozen until the update finishes or you reboot ( which will cancel the changes and makes you start the update all over , but at least then you will know what is going on ) . What I do like : Desktop mode : easier to use , even better than XP , really like when you open File Explorer , it will give you the pathway tree and you can click anywhere along the line to jump instantly there ( big assist when migrating data ) . Second like : Customizable everything : Is there anything you CAN'T customize with this OS ? Place the taskbar anywhere , Make whatever picture your app icon ... and that 's not even the tip of the iceberg . Third like : Free Windows 10 Upgrade . I ca n't wait . All in all , the system 's not bad , but it 's truly built for what I am running ... a power machine . It will eat budget machines alive . I 'm hoping 10 will use less resources so I can stretch out more of the 32GB for other fun stuff ... .#### #### ####[([153], [96], 'NEU'), ([153], [150], 'NEU'), ([35, 36], [226], 'NEU'), ([35, 36], [329, 330], 'NEU'), ([98, 99], [96], 'NEU'), ([98, 99], [150], 'NEU'), ([152, 153], [96], 'NEU'), ([152, 153], [150], 'NEU')]

Truthfully , I have n't done too much video editing , but I am really impressed with the intuitive tutorial that you can access at any time .

The built-in OCR in any printer is worlds better than this package . I think it may have correctly interpreted 1-2 % of characters . Probably the biggest waste of time and money I 've ever experienced in software . I 'm not angry , and I do n't want ( or expect ) a refund . I 'm simply informing those interested that this software will not perform anywhere in the realm of an OCR . It behaves moreover as a random character generator . Your printer 's OCR drivers will beat this every time. < br />< br /> I have fed this scanned pdf 's , typed PDF 's , and OneNote handwritten ( via stylus ) pages . All failed to accurately interpret ~ 98 % of characters . For a large company 's primary products , this much sound like an exaggeration or user error . You do n't know me , but take it from an unknown source , this is no exaggeration . I 'm proficient in many platforms of graphic and print design and layout , engineering modeling , word processing , office and office macros , most of adobe 's offerings , ect .

Lacks some of the shape tools and more sophisticated text handling you 'd expect from Photoshop , but has some very nice features that more than make up for these shortcomings - the best of which is that you have a tools console that let you fine tune most tools ( pencil , paint brush , airbrush , eraser , selection tools ) on the fly , as you go ( e.g. you can change the size , density , hardness , flow rate of an airbrush or brush or pencil - stop and change settings as you need then continue , no problem ) . Has a nice , rearrangable / customizable work area . Easy handling of multiple layers , great for compositing images . Not as strong as Photoshop in the ' layers effects' but overall quite adequate for most users , I 'd think. < br /> If you do n't want to have to ' rent ' your photo-editing software & put your work on some ' cloud ' ( not my idea of secure storage , no matter what the software pushers say ) - then this is an excellent tool for you !#### #### ####[([10], [0], 'POS'), ([42], [122], 'POS'), ([42], [21], 'POS'), ([42], [108], 'POS'), ([42], [116], 'POS'), ([22], [21], 'POS'), ([22], [116], 'POS'), ([113, 114], [108], 'POS'), ([113, 114], [116], 'POS')]

I have used turbo tax for 20 years . Recently they have screwed up their business model , by aligning everything to their online offerings .

While Norton Internet Security Software may be pretty good compared to others there is one huge drawback to Semantec Products : At about the half way point in customers' paid subscriptions Norton security software is programmed to dump its subscribers completely ( kick them to the curb , so to speak ) leaving Norton customers completely unprotected and leaving customers' computers wide open to fraud , phishing and loss of personal data. < br /> When this happens Norton starts running Expired Subscription Notices and warning its customers to renew their subscriptions immediately or face hacking and information theft. < br /> I have been using Norton for the past 2 years and at first I thought it was just an honest mistake but then the same thing happened again on my 2nd year of my subscription about 6 months after I renewed the program ; and this time I could n't get thru to Norton servers to correct the problem with a Semantec Rep because ( they said ) all servers were down . The only available option was to pay more money to renew my &# 34 ; expired &# 34 ; Norton software . In other words Norton / Semantec was Money-Grubbing for &# 34 ; New &# 34 ; Subscribers and extra Cash Flow. < br /> I told them to stuff it ; I purchased another security program from their competition and I advise all Norton / Semantec Customers to do the same .#### #### ####[([3], [8], 'NEG'), ([3], [16], 'NEG'), ([195], [81], 'NEG'), ([171], [81], 'NEG')]

A very loose story line consisting of characters telling you to do things for them that require you to visit those annoying HO scenes over and over again . The small number of mini games or puzzles were unoriginal and either too easy or impossible to determine what you needed to do .

This was a great price for Win 7 - included the hologram with product key ( it was under the label inside the DVD case ) . Disc was read no problem , OS loaded without any hiccup . Just note - these System Builder kits are meant for only a single computer - other comments indicate that if you change out your hard drive , this OS will no longer work . That was fine for me - I was specifically changing to an SDD , and I figured I should do a clean Windows install anyway . But if your hard drive is old or &# 34 ; clicking ,&# 34 ; get a new hard drive before you install this OS . ( Get an SDD - Win 7 on SDD has been fast and stable so far , and my computer is from 2006 , so it 's technically not even rated for Win 7 . ) Also , check your processor - I was hoping I could get Win 7 64-bit , but my processor does not support that , so I went with 32-bit .

I bought the Cook’n software a couple of years ago to help me with a food allergy issue . I was put on a 4-day rotation plan , where I could n’t eat the same thing on consecutive days . I was bewildered as to how I was going to sort all my menus out until I hit on the Cook’n software and its category system . It was a breeze !< br /> Another plus is that I can run around the Internet looking for recipes to suit my allergies and , when I find one , I can instantly post it into my software . Even if the recipe does n’t suit me exactly , I love it that I can tailor any ingredient / amount to what ’s healthy for me . I can access my recipes any time ; put it on my tablet for easy use in the kitchen ; and easily share recipes on social media or e-mail. < br /> I recently joined the Cook’n Club . What a gold mine ! Besides getting a FREE COOKBOOK EVERY MONTH , I am participating in the Cook’n forum , which is a perk in my day. < br /> I recently had technical issues ( for reasons still unknown ) . The tech staff at DVO is top-notch ! They stuck with me until the issue was resolved , and now I am enjoying Cook’n all over again . ( I like that all my recipes are automatically backed up to the cloud , and I never lost a recipe or my organization. )< br /> I highly recommend this software for beginning , intermediate , or advanced cooks .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [70], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [247], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [274], 'POS'), ([218, 219], [223], 'POS'), ([218, 219], [70], 'POS'), ([218, 219], [247], 'POS'), ([218, 219], [274], 'POS')]

Reading a PDF with no conversion on a Kindle is very un pleasant as the characters are too small. < br /> I bought this primarily to convert PDF files to ebook documents. < br />< br /> Then I found out that it just cant really deal with most mathematical formulae. < br /> But I found out later that this is not a solved problem : there is no OCR for any but the most trivial formulae. < br /> Even the Greek letter pi inside text gets converted into &# 34 ; 7r &# 34 ; .

I originally owned this software in the early 90 's and it would really tax my old 386 25mhz PC , I remember the snowbarn.cdr file would take over an half hour to render .

My experience was similar to many who rave about this product . The Trojan that had imbedded itself in five files and folders slowed down my computer to a crawl and repeatedly caused it to freeze up . I was desperate , and went to Best Buy for advice . The recommended option was to pay $ 199 for their Geek Service . They do a great job , but I did n't want to pay for it . The second option , he said , was to download the free Malwarebytes . It 's difficult to do that when every window freezes up , but I was eventually successful and ran an hour 's scan . The result was AMAZING ! The program identified the Trojan in an heuristic analysis , as well as another malware it classified as flying under the radar of antivirus programs . Now my computer runs faster than it did before the major attack and has cleared up small gliches that I previously thought were registry issues . I 'm so happy ! I would recommend this program to everyone .#### #### ####[([60, 61], [66], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [152], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [181], 'POS'), ([91], [172], 'POS')]

great software . The customer service team and Dan Oaks the President and founder have been working tirelessly to get the website , the Mac software and the iPhone / iPad apps all working together seamlessly . Just today Mr. Oaks emailed me saying they are working updating the older recipes in the archives so that they are Mac compatible to download . The new iPhone app is improving on a regular basis . When the old app was n't working they decided to tackle it from the ground up and rebuild . It took a while the but the results are worth the wait . If you LOVE recipes , have an addiction to collecting them on the web and in magazines and emails etc but need ONE Amazing place to organize them all , Try Cook'n with the apps . I have not used the Android apps but I understand they work the same way . I have tried every major and minor cookbook software available for the Mac , this wins Hands Down ! Expect a few glitches as they work out the new iPhone app in phases but customer service is helpful and resolves them efficiently . Do not let any growing pains deter you . This Software is the ONLY Software I have ever used with recipe capture right from the internet .

As someone who is very comfortable with Photoshop , I approached Adobe Lightroom with great reservation . But , I was intrigued by its editing tools and wanted one of its most useful features -- soft proofing . The learning curve was uncomfortable , primarily because Lightroom wants to be your primary photo manager . You must abandon your understanding of computer files and folders and give into Lightroom 's organizational style . Once that 's accomplished , everything else is easy . The photo editor is a joy to use , and the program allows you to jump out to other programs as much as you need to provided you use Lightroom as the home base . Initially , I found myself jumping to Photoshop all the time , but now that I 'm used to Lightroom 's tools , I find myself doing is less and less . Instead , I find myself employing the Topaz line of tools . It 's also easy on storage memory given the way edits are saved . And when all is said and done , and the image is ready to publish , the print manager is fabulous .#### #### ####[([36], [32], 'POS'), ([36], [196], 'POS'), ([84, 85], [88], 'POS'), ([33], [32], 'POS')]

Not technically savvy so got on phone and called my tech service subscribed to who immediately took care of the situation through internet teleport .

Unfortunately for me though because I bought the system based on excellent presentation by shopping network who , by the way said the product was only replaceable within thirty days so would not refund 100 dollars I spent for the system . So writing to say that it did not provide virus protection , company does n't put money where their mouth is and they do n't care if you get on the internet to warn others about their unk system , did not do well for me and wo n't buy anything like this from a home shopping network unless planning to use it right away , so can return#### #### ####[([9, 10], [11], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [87], 'NEG'), ([140, 141], [11], 'NEG'), ([140, 141], [87], 'NEG')]

First off , I 'll say that I am a fan of Lightroom and have been using it since Version 3 . It is my go-to program for importing / editing / storing photos both from my Canon DSLR and my family 's smartphones. < br />< br /> However , I was unhappy about how long Adobe took to fix glaring issues in their previous Lightroom 5 , and now Adobe 's new policies for Lightroom 6 are another thorn in my side . Specifically , the policy that standalone versions of Lightroom 6 will get no feature updates is just a poor way to treat new and long-time Lightroom customers. < br />< br /> Looking at updates to the * previous * Lightroom 5 , there were bug fixes of course , but Lightroom also gained the following functions :< br />- Lightroom 5.2 : added Feather control for the Clone / Heal brush , added Smoothness adjustment slider for Color Noise Reduction. < br />- Lightroom 5.4 : added support for Lightroom Sync. < br />- Lightroom 5.7 : added integrated Aperture / iPhoto importer. < br /> Nothing huge , but definitely some useful features. < br />< br /> Now with Lightroom 6 , features added to the CC ( subscription ) version are being specifically excluded from the standalone product . The first of these is the Dehaze slider , but I guess there will be others in the future . And once again my opinion of a good product is marred by the poorly thought out and greedy policies of Adobe . I 'm not sure what the correct policy is - but I do know that the current policy is the wrong one. < br />< br /> I 've read in a few places that Adobe claims the Sarbanes – Oxley Act of 2002 prevents them from adding new features to products already paid for . However , this flies in the face of real world examples from the small ( Angry Birds supplying many new levels for the initial 99 cent purchase ) to the quite large ( Microsoft giving all Windows 7 and Windows 8 users a free copy of Windows 10 ) . You need a better excuse , Adobe. < br />< br /> Edit - if you 've own a previous version of Lightroom * do not * buy the Full version here - buy the Upgrade version directly from Adobe and save $ 70 .#### #### ####[([149, 150], [103], 'NEU'), ([149, 150], [261], 'NEU'), ([234, 235], [103], 'NEU'), ([234, 235], [261], 'NEU'), ([319], [198], 'NEU'), ([185], [103], 'NEU')]

This review is more for Corel as a company than for WordPerfect as a program . I have been using WordPerfect since the DOS days - yes I am old ! ! I love the program . I feel it 's much easier to use than Word ( for me , anyway ) . But lately , Corel 's support has basically vanished . There is no support phone service , there is no support chat . The only thin you can do is email them and hope they get back to you in a day or so. < br />< br /> My problem started as I was preparing a paper that I needed for the next day . When I tried to open a new document , I got an error message that my &# 34 ; trial &# 34 ; version had expired and that I needed to activate the program . I had registered the program after I installed it and the program was activated . I tried re-activating it using the pop up box that contained the error ( it gave that option ) , but then I received a message that I had activated this program too many times on this computer ( it was the first install , BTW ) . Than , since I could n't activate that way , it said enter your Activation code . I never received an activation code , only a serial number for my legally purchased and registered program . As I needed to complete my paper for the next morning , I hunted furiously for a support contact number . I could not find any . Long story short , I never found any way to contact support other than sending an email . Fortunately , I was able to finish my paper on another computer. < br />< br /> I did not hear back from Corel until a day and a half later asking me what the problem was . I replied with an explanation of the issue . That was a week ago . I have not received a response to my reply containing the explanation . Normally WordPerfect does n't cause too many issues and when it works , I love the program . But you should be aware of this support status these days if you are considering buying this program .#### #### ####[([11], [62], 'NEU'), ([35], [33], 'NEU'), ([35], [42], 'NEU'), ([35], [379], 'NEU'), ([44], [42], 'NEU')]

I really like this because it does everything I wanted it too . It ’s like viewing , editing and cropping my pictures with my Microsoft Picture Viewer . Really. . ! I can even adjust the color any way I want on my all my videos , and I can also set the contrast up to make my videos come to life . I can zoom , expand and save it just the way I like it . It ’s totally what I ’ve been looking for . Although it did crash on me a few times when I was making too many tweaks to my video . However when I closed the program and opened it up again I found it saved all my previous work . Nice. . So Next time. . I will be sure save my progress as I go . I also managed to get an error when I made too many tweaks to the video audio track . It ’s did n’t save my video to HDD , only the audio was there but that was also no problem because I went back and saved it again without the Magic tool . Stay away from the Magic tool. . ( It was n’t helping me out at all. . ) But this sort of thing is trivial with only a few flaws. . I actually highly recommend this video editor for anyone who likes doing this type hobby . It ’s much better than my old Video Editor and I ’m totally satisfied with my purchase. < br />< br /> Note : There are a few YouTube video on this software which helped me out in several ways . Like mostly , after I import my video I ca n’t do anything with it until I drag it down to the video editing bar . That ’s where I make the magic happen . It ’s been about a week now and I ’m getting the knack for using Cyberlink . Hope you enjoy it and make some awesome videos like I just did . : )#### #### ####[([25, 26, 27], [249], 'POS'), ([37], [249], 'POS')]

There was no written instruction , you 're on your own with the three discs .

I use the dictation box or pad and then copy and paste my text into my word file. < br /> I did not have any particular problems with the installation , beyond the fact that it took a very long time ( a few hours ).< br /> Dictating this review , there was one major error : Dragon typed & quot ; men instead of improvement. < br /> However , Dragon is typing the words almost as quickly as I can say them .

First off , I did not buy this lamp on Amazon , but I did check here for reviews and found none . A seller on E-bay happened to be selling one cheaper because the box was damaged . Since I usually shop Amazon and especially read reviews before purchasing anything , I want to help other potential buyers make the right personal choice . So ... there is no good description anywhere about how this lamp works for a cubicle space . I took a chance and am glad I did . It has an adjustable bracket that cannot be seen in the picture ; it fits over the top of the cubicle wall . The problem is that the bracket did not open wide enough for my cubicle wall . This was a simple fix for me - I took the back side of the bracket off and then used strong double-sided Velcro to attach the remaining top piece of the bracket to the top wood strip of the cubicle wall . Hopefully , when I retire in 11 years , there will be no damage to the wood piece . :-) The lamp can be moved up and down on the u-shaped slide that can be seen in the photo . I do not believe that it moves easily enough so I keep it in a stationary position over my desk . It also swings left to right and in and out easily , but I have it positioned where I want it , so I do not use those features much either . Plus , it is only being held by hidden Velcro , so I do not want to move it around too much . I have a 60 watt LED bulb and it is bright and beautiful . When I first received the lamp and opened the box , I thought that I had made a mistake purchasing it because it is large . However , once I got it in place , it looks wonderful in my perfectly decorated cubicle . Best of all I will save my eyesight while reading at my desk . This lamp is exactly what I want and need it to be ... after a little improvising on my part .

I had rights to downgrade to Win 7 but decided to keep Win 8.1 pro with my new computer . If I had to choose a primary reason to keep the Win 8 , it would be for speed . Boot time as well as overall snappiness is markedly improved over Win 7. < br />< br /> I have a touchscreen that I take advantage every so often . But , I do n't feel the touch screen is necessary when using 8.1 < br />< br /> Good luck < br />< br /> Good luck .#### #### ####[([84], [95], 'POS'), ([87], [95], 'POS')]
It cost way too much for only 3 downloads . Plus ....... I mean MINUS really ....... Outlook was NOT included . The only changes I have noticed are it looks a little bit crisper / sharper than Office 2007 . The only reason I purchased it was the newest Office Suite was even more expensive . Now MS wants to charge monthly for Outlook ? WTF ?#### #### ####[([17], [19, 20], 'NEG'), ([50, 51], [34], 'NEG'), ([50, 51], [36], 'NEG'), ([50, 51], [55], 'NEG')]

The product works as described . The drives comes with both 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu , in bootable format . It also includes means for installation. < br />< br /> For a small fee , you get a usb 2.0 drive with a bootable Linux distro pre-installed . While you can make your own bootable drive , it 's a hassle in my experience , and I do n't like wasting usb 3.0 flash drives for such a task . This package gives you everything you need for less than the cost of a usb 2.0 flash drive , so you ca n't beat it. < br />< br /> The drive itself is mediocre quality and is n't name-brand -- I would n't use it to store any important data for instance . But that 's not what it 's for and again , the price is nice. < br />< br /> There 's a great deal of documentation online for bootable Ubuntu , so the support is strong. < br />< br /> I 'm a web software engineer . In terms of OS , I typically only use Unix and OS X . However , I recently purchased a cheap ASUS x55leb01 to run Windows and Linux . ( It was a more convenient option than setting up VMs on my development laptop , and it allows me to do some pen testing and exploring without worry as well . ) Despite the description saying it would come with Windows 7 , it came with Windows 8.1 . Anyway , I 've had some difficulty running Ubuntu 14.04 as a second OS . I partitioned the hard drive , configured the machine 's firmware and boot process and installed Ubuntu with this drive . Unfortunately , there 's apparently some issues with 14.04 and Windows 8.1 . The installation process is going to require some extra work . So this is n't a reflection on the product itself , it is just a note to make sure you look into compatibility and understand how to use this product. < br />< br /> Overall , I 'm happy with this product and recommend it for anyone seeking a quick solution for bootable Ubuntu .#### #### ####[([165], [61], 'POS'), ([165], [305], 'POS'), ([112], [61], 'POS'), ([112], [305], 'POS')]

Like so many others , I am writing this using Dragon. < br />< br /> Right now , I have a bad head cold and a sore throat , so my level of accuracy has been reduced . That said , I am completely blown away by the level of accuracy that I can achieve . Installation was easy , there was no horribly tedious long training process that I expected. < br />< br /> There have been hiccups . It occasionally stops recognizing the microphone . When that happens , I have to close Dragon and restart it . That does n't take very much time , though , it is perfectly manageable. < br />< br /> One important thing that I will say is that I am not sure how people can use a program like this without doing something with their hands if that is an option . I was about to go crazy until I started embroidering while I wrote . Now , my workflow is pretty seamless. < br />< br /> Overall , I 'm extremely happy .#### #### ####[([87], [84], 'POS')]

Have to agree with Robert Bidinotto 's excellent review . There 's not much more to add as he covers most of it . I was using WIN4 for years and found it very good but then I heard a lot about Scrivener and that it had been ported from the MAC to the PC so I thought I would give that a go . Used Scrivener for a year largely because it was in active development while development on WIN4 seemed to have stopped . To be honest I was reasonably happy with Scrivener but I would n't consider myself a power user with the software as the learning curve is pretty steep and would rather be writing than learning how to use the software . Along came WIN5 so I decided to move back and am glad I did as it was like rediscovering an old friend . The new features are excellent and as well as this WIN5 is faster then WIN4 . Everything just seems more snappier . I know Scrivener has a lot of love out there but I genuinely find WriteItNow a lot easier to use and in terms of organisation nothing really beats it . I do n't find myself looking at help files or tutorials as I had to do with Scrivener as WIN5 is much easier to get your head around and I think if you download and try the demo , you will too !#### #### ####[([110], [113], 'POS'), ([110], [162], 'POS'), ([152], [154], 'POS'), ([160], [162], 'POS')]

After happily using Movie Edit Pro 17 Plus for a coupla years , I decided to &# 34 ; upgrade &# 34 ; to the 2015 version . I 'm two months in to struggling with this garbage - so I 've gone back to the older version . But hey , the $ 70 spent on this software was n't a complete waste ... the DVD works great as a shiny drink coaster . I use this software to edit together multi-camera live music videos . I mix the audio and edit together the multiple video angles into one video . My biggest issues are these ( in comparison to the three-year-old Movie Edit Pro 17 Plus ) : SLOW ! Something as simple as loading a video file into the editing window takes forever . Then , after finally loading your videos on the timeline , heaven forbid you actually want to visualize the audio portion of one of the files because rendering takes EASILY three times longer in the new version compared to the old . And while it 's taking forever , the software locks you out until it 's completed its task . UNSTABLE ! The program locks up at least once out of every 5 times I use it . I 'm sure the manufacturer can back me on this because they 've received DOZENS of crash reports from my computer . I can count on one hand the number of times the older version crashed on me over two-plus years . UGLY ! One of the selling points is the cleaner looking colors . This new version looks hideous and is harder to navigate because their choice in colors . I have yet to find a &# 34 ; Use old visualization style &# 34 ; setting or someplace to customize the visual settings so I can manually undo their &# 34 ; improvements &# 34 ; . AUDIO EDITING ! They 've changed the way the audio controls affect the finished sound . After years of getting great sound from version 17 , the exact same controls , used in the same manner offer much worse results . AUDIO SYNC ! In this version , you have the option of synching up multiple files based on the audio tracks . This would be great if it actually worked . It does n't . There is one feature I like in this version . The multicam editing works well in theory . Loading four different videos and clicking on which angle you want to use at which point in the video is a time saver ... but it wo n't use cropped video . So , instead of clicking and finishing , I then have to go back and crop individual camera angles before finishing . After running the old version and this version on the same computer , using the same video / audio files , I have given up on the new version completely and I will not be purchasing another version of this software . And just to illustrate my point - I started rendering the audio visualization on a 16-minute long video before I started typing this . The file is currently at about 50 % in calculating graphics data ... but at least my beautiful coffee table will be protected from cold drink water rings . Edit : I almost forgot ... ANNOYING ! Right out of the box , the program is unuseable until you register . And if you happen to have an earlier version registered from years ago and you do n't know your password , you ca n't use this version until you sort it out . No , &# 34 ; remind me later &# 34 ; . No , &# 34 ; deny registration &# 34 ; . It 's either &# 34 ; give us your information or get lost &# 34 ; . My solution was creating a new Gmail account and registering a password consisting of several choice explitives strung together .

Only a high rating because I 've used Turbo Tax for over 20 years and it is convenient . I resent the fact that they took forms out this year from the Deluxe version ( Schedule D and E ) , causing me to buy a higher priced product . Of course , there are a lot of other people equally disappointed in their decision . I tried to get the rebate that was promised online and with a customer rep that I talked to . Turns out the rebate expired in April . The first thing I did n't do after finishing my taxes on April 12 was apply for a rebate , so I missed out . The rebate was the only reason I had decided to stay with TurboTax for 2014 taxes . Really , Intuit , have you ever heard of extensions for filing taxes ? Cutting your rebate off in April was really stingy since the form was supposed to be filed before filing for the rebate . If they continue putting the forms I need in a the premier version , I may check out the competitors for 2015 tax prep .#### #### ####[([8, 9], [17], 'POS'), ([8, 9], [158], 'POS'), ([89], [90], 'POS'), ([89], [158], 'POS')]
Fluenz is the best Spanish program we have used . We are homeschoolers , and over the years I tried several different programs with our children , including Rosetta stone , Berlitz , and Learnables . All of them fell short of our expectations . Fluenz is absolutely amazing compared to those other programs. < br />< br />( Rosetta Stone was very confusing to my daughter , because they never explained anything , and expected her to learn through &# 34 ; immersion. &# 34 ; I did the Rosetta Stone program myself up to level / year 4 , and I think I only gained about 1-2 years of high school level Spanish )< br />< br /> The Fluenz program is highly superior to all the other programs . It provides a teacher who speaks in English , and who teaches the lesson and explains anything that is confusing . The practices are very thorough , and my daughter 's accent is extremely good . Many people have commented that she sounds like a native speaker. < br />< br /> You can repeat or skip any sections that you want to . You learn through pictures and video , conversations , and also through extensive writing / grammar exercises . The entire program can be done on the computer. < br />< br /> As a mom who homeschools 5 children , and who has only a basic knowledge of Spanish , I really appreciated the fact that my daughter could do her entire Spanish program on her own . That freed up my time to help her with some of her other classwork . With Fluenz , I know my children could learn any language , regardless of my own person knowledge. < br />< br /> The only negative to this program is that there is a lot of repetition . So if you have a child who highly dislikes repetition , they may not like it . But honestly , without the repetition , you probably will not retain much of what you learned. < br />< br /> Soon , when my daughter is done with this program , she is going to test out of college Spanish through the CLEP program . You can get up to 14 college credits that way. < br />< br /> I tend to be very picky about curriculum , but I have to say that I cannot be more pleased with Fluenz.have to say that I cannot be more pleased with Fluenz .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [3], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [125], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [157], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [166], 'POS'), ([163], [157], 'POS'), ([163], [166], 'POS')]

The actual speech recognition is slightly better than Apple 's built-in speech recognition . Dragon Dictate has the benefit that it is programmable , with the effect being that you can add macros to all sorts of programs , which can include text and commands and even AppleScript .

Dragon 's major downside is that , in officially unsupported software , the sentences that you speak usually have capitalization problems. < br />< br /> Do n't bother calling their support department .

I have been using SurfEasy for almost a year now and true to what this review says it 's stable for the most part , fast and pretty much flawless to use once it 's set up . It has one major drawback which you need to consider before you shell out any cash however . The SurfEasy VPN instantly shuts off your protection when it detects you are torrenting . It goes so far as to put up a warning that it has disabled itself because you are on a torrent site and then eventually resumes once you exit the site. < br />< br /> To be honest , I just want a VPN to be a VPN and I really do n't care about the pressure from the entertainment industry . They do n't seem to be squeamish about any ( and I mean ANY ) other form of traffic they let through ( which honestly is a VPN 's job ) , so why block torrents , and what will be next ??< br />< br /> As much as I like the service , I will very likely not use them again , and find a VPN that just does the job without their own in-house surveillance and controls .#### #### ####[([31], [29], 'NEU'), ([31], [185], 'NEU')]

Sound Forge Audio Studio 10 was included in the Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platimum 10 Suite I purchased in 2010 . I use Sound Forge every week to edit the sermons from our church . MUCH easier to use than Goldwave or Audacity , it is very easy to use . The only issues I have with it is I ca n't use 3rd party addons / codecs and I have to save recordings as wave files , then convert to mp3 with other applications like Goldwave . This is because for some unknown reason ( Sony has yet to address ?) , if I save it to mp3 , the length of the recording increases by a random fraction of a second . CD authoring software likes whole numbers , or more precisely , the players like whole numbers , otherwise they have to compensate for the fraction of a second causing the playback to not be consistent . This is mostly a problem when the fraction of a second occurs between 2 songs . It can affect gap length when you have 2 songs , especially without a gap between them ( think Boston 's &# 34 ; 3rd Stage &# 34 ; album , or Queen 's &# 34 ; We will Rock You / We are The Champions &# 34 ; song ) , there may be a stutter from the player calculating the length of the song . I have CD authoring software that will tell me a song is &# 34 ; not compliant &# 34 ; to the Redbook Standard ( https :// en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Compact _ Disc _ Digital _ Audio ) if I do n't edit my recording to whole numbers ( like 1:35 [ good ] instead of 1:35.035 [ bad ]) . Maybe a newer version of Sound Forge has fixed this error , but I do not know . Sony has yet to tell me if they fixed the error . I submitted it to them a long time ago and they said they would look into it .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [165], 'POS')]

I purchased this through Amazon because Intuit no longer supported my 2012 version . This upgrade is pretty frustrating to work with compared to 2012 . I feel like their credit card services are being forced down my throat . The credit card payment method is everywhere and it 's very annoying to have to turn off . I really liked the bank ACH payment method from the 2012 version , but it does n't work correctly in the 2015 version . My guess is that it is not a priority because they only charge $. 50 per ACH transaction while they charge 2.4 % on the credit card side . Why would someone use their credit card services when you can use a different vendor for half the fee ? Anyway , I guess it does n't matter because the Payment Center does n't recognize my password despite resetting it several times . I do n't recommend this product at this time .#### #### ####[([142], [51], 'NEG'), ([142], [73, 74], 'NEG'), ([142], [143, 144], 'NEG'), ([30, 31], [143, 144], 'NEG'), ([41, 42], [51], 'NEG'), ([41, 42], [143, 144], 'NEG'), ([63], [73, 74], 'NEG')]

On more than one occasion this software , over time , removed critical files that caused me to wipe the laptop and start over to regain critical operating files . Every single version of this software ( since v10-12 ) removes critical files - such as system restore points ( even those manually created ) to restore your system in the event of a failure . If you also use Norton ( ID safe or other Symantec products ) , this software uninstalls the temp files , updates , and backed up files . This software occasionally changes the properties of files - such as the print spooler -- by uninstalling or relegating it to a status where it does n't start . You will have to manually go in and change that status back to proper start group . It also removes critical extension files of your downloaded software by deeming them irrelevant or space-wasting files . The software does help bring your system connectivity back to optimal speed with efficiency . It 's just too aggressive and error-prone when it comes to assessing the actual files it ought to support rather than remove / alter . Needs better algorithms .#### #### ####[([46, 47], [82], 'NEU'), ([46, 47], [155], 'NEU'), ([106, 107], [82], 'NEU'), ([106, 107], [155], 'NEU'), ([106, 107], [199], 'NEU')]

It 's a tax program , OK ? I mean , I 'm not going to get all excited about it . Yet it does a very good job . I 've been using TurboTax for well over 15 years , and am pleased with it ? Why not 5-stars ?? ? Because for the year 2014 , they screwed around with how they packaged and distributed their various versions , and now have this new &# 34 ; Deductions and Homeowners &# 34 ; version that has removed some of the features from previous versions , requiring you to either forego the feature , or pay for the ( even more ) expensive versions. < br />< br /> My personal opinion is that , if the government wants us to pay them taxes every year , then THEY should supply the tax software .

I have used this software for over a year now . It is great to put all my saved recipes in one place . I ca n't say it is perfect but it is better than what I had before . It imports recipes on the Internet . Depending on the sites , some imports work perfectly and some need adjustments / corrections before I save them . I had an IT career , it was very hard to satisfy all customers and create perfect software , so I do n't mind the glitches this software has . Yes it is annoying when suddenly the program quits , but you can just relaunch . I have the software on my Mac , iPad and iPhone and it is so convenient to be able to bring up a recipe to check what ingredients I need to buy at the grocery store. < br />< br /> I have had to contact the technical support a few times and every time they replied in a timely matter and my problems were resolved .

Exactly what it says it is folks - a DVD containing Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit , SP1 , and a COA ( Certificate of Authenticity ) which you stick on the side of your computer so when the Microsoft License Police invade your home , you can prove you did n't steal the license . Yes , it does say on the COA that it is for a &# 34 ; refurbished &# 34 ; PC , but I can tell you from decades of experience it makes absolutely no difference to anyone , nor does it change the product or its performance. < br />< br /> If you need a copy of Windows 7 because you just built a PC , or simply need to reinstall Windows because you lost your copy , this will do the trick .

Moneydance is an excellent program for managing your finances , but my low rating comes from the fact that in order to use it , you have to look at it . The UI has been destroyed .

One of the last first-person dungeon crawls from the heyday of such games . As such , it is pretty well polished and refined . In a sense , it is a rather &# 34 ; dumbed down &# 34 ; game , considering how complex most of these games were at the time . There are no experience levels , though the game 's systems kind of imitate a levelling system . In this game , your stat increases come from items you find while exploring . So , rather than farm levels , you will just have to search everywhere to ensure you are getting powered up . Your weapon and magic skills increase slowly with use , and monsters do n't respawn . Also , there actually is a useful , markable map in-game , so that is very helpful . You collect a decent amount of magic over the course of the game , but every time you play it is the same. < br />< br /> The pixel art and MIDI tracks are perfect , and have held up very well . The dungeons have a little more variety than many of the other dungeon crawlers of the day , and the layouts are a lot less frustrating with fewer nonsense puzzles and more pure exploration. < br />< br /> You are restricted to the one character , so if you are looking for a party based dungeon crawler , look elsewhere . Otherwise , if you are looking for a real classic and one of the best of the genre , you would do well to give it a try . Mount your disc drive in DOSBox , and it runs perfect on modern consoles . The only real downside I can think of is that it is n't very replayable , since you will want to explore everywhere and collect everything with each play-through , and it will be the same every time , with every character ( you pick one of five ) learning the same spells and using the same weapons. < br />< br /> As far as single character , first person dungeon crawls go , this is easily the best of all time .#### #### ####[([113, 114], [289], 'POS')]

Being relatively new to DSLR photography this is my first experience with Lightroom software . Previously I had used point-and-shoot cameras and made adjustments with Photoshop Elements , which I liked a lot . I resisted Lightroom because I thought PS Elements did everything I could possibly need - I was wrong. < br />< br /> Having joined a digital photography club in an attempt to learn more about my camera , I was surprised at how universally the other , more experienced members , loved and recommended Lightroom . In addition to being a superior tool for organizing photos , Lightroom also allows you to do some nice editing and seems to handle edits to my Canon RAW files better than Elements did . There is also an option to take the files I 've been working on in Lightroom and &# 34 ; Edit In &# 34 ; another program , so I can finish them off in Elements . Or , I can just use my favorite filters in Lightroom directly. < br />< br /> In addition to editing , Lightroom makes it easy to watermark your photos and publish them to the internet , including Facebook. < br />< br /> Maybe my favorite feature in Lightroom is the ability to tether the camera to the PC while I 'm doing a shoot and see the images in full size . With a full size image on the screen it 's so much easier to see if I need to make changes in lighting , position , filters , etc. < br />< br /> Learning and using Lightroom was not intuitive for me , even as someone with years of experience using Adobe 's Photoshop Elements . However , there are some fantastic free video tutorials on the Adobe website that can walk you through how to do the basic functions . For experienced Lightroom users there is also a video with detailed outlines of six new features and improvements in Lightroom 5. < br />< br /> Highly recommended to anyone who is trying to move beyond basic point-and-shoot photography and basic edits .#### #### ####[([12, 13], [188], 'POS'), ([12, 13], [249], 'POS'), ([12, 13], [276, 277], 'POS'), ([89], [188], 'POS'), ([89], [249], 'POS')]

I do NOT like McAfee as a corporation and their product has started going downhill , by the time I need to renew , I will probably have researched a different provider . McAfee call centers in the Philippines is probably one of the worse call centers I have EVER had to deal with .

Also this version of McAfee is becoming bloatware - too much of a memory hog . Also if purchasing this product from this vendor ( 3-year version ) - the vendor pre-activates to a different account and if you have an existing account and are just renewing McAfee cannot merge the accounts - so its a clusterf * uck to get it resolved , McAfee has to close the old account , create a new , then you have to completely remove all McAfee products from your workstations and re-install - it was a mess and add McAfee 's call center to the mix , it was a nightmare .#### #### ####[([72], [44], 'NEG'), ([72], [193], 'NEG')]

The APICS exam simulator is a total rip off. < br />< br /> 1 ) Some of the questions even on the real APICS exams are really stupid and have little or no real life relevance . They pick any random line from the books and translate it into questions . I am already half way through so I will definitely go through the entire certification but not really sure what value addition does it do . So knowledge gain by studying for certification vs. time and cost is something which does n't give a good ROI < br />< br /> At a professional level am not sure - probably it will be helpful but the price of APICS certification ($ 140 for a student member ) itself is a rip off. < br />< br /> 2 ) I bought t he simulator exam . It has LITTLE OR NO RELEVANCE to the real time exam . I wish I had read other reviews here before buying . I was too panicked before my first exam so I ended up buying this one through APICS website . I was so discouraged by the simulator test result that i thought I would fail . But I did n't .

I am not a novice when it comes to recipe programs since I have purchased five other programs in the last 20 years . I think the overall functions of the Cook'n is the best I have used yet and is absolutely the best organized and keeps getting better . When I have had a problem the trouble shooters have performed like no other company and found a solution immediately like I was their only customer . This is very special service which is not found often . I have the program on a MAC OS-X which is my main computer for making my cookbook but had to put it on my PC because my wife wanted to check all my work and could not use the MAC . It has great ' themes' for all interest and when you email a recipe to someone , it looks just like it does on your computer. < br />< br /> Update : I 've been using this program since it first came out . It has had problems since the beginning , but now my really big complaint is that they want to charge about $ 5.00 and up per month to use Cook'n , so the too small fonts and other update problems are not the only problem . I complained to DVO that every time I have opened it tells me I have to join their Cloud Cook'n program to continue using it . Finally , after much complaining by me that I did n't want to see that notice that I need to join the program to see my recipes , they told me I did n't have to pay any other fees and could use the program without any more help from them . When I just signed up for their cloud program it deleted several chapters on my recipe collection and would not allow me to update from a backup . I had to restore my MAC software to get it back my Cook'n files and lost this weeks work on everything else .

So far , I have been very pleased with this software . It has been loaded on three computers , as purchased . The security scan on two computers resulted in no threats detected ... I was wondering if it was doing the job intended . However , on the third computer ( my wife 's ) there were multiple threats detected and we were able to correct them all . It has been unobtrusive , working in the background , and does n't take any noticeable resources to operate . It is definitely there ... put in a thumb drive or a CD , and up pops a window ' asking ' if I want it to scan . I receive a small window now and then letting me know that the software has updated itself . No ads , thankfully , and no distracting pop-up windows for any other reason . Good idea to run a full scan about once per month ... takes about an hour to do this , so I let it run while I 'm watching a movie or doing errands .

The software arrived as advertised but with one caveat you must call ( says so on little piece of paper that comes with it ) Microsoft online activation. < br /> Software installed fine but rejected the product code with message to call the micosoft . The call center sucks they try to send a txt message I am still waiting after about three tries so I try the voice activation stupid computer can neither recognize my accent ( NZ ) or my keypad presses then I am transferred to god knows where but the nice lady had a very very confusing accent finally got it activated . I am happy now but I am not sure that the savings were equal to the frustrations in activating only you can decide that. < br /> And bother with windows 10 I personally do not like it it tries to do the Apple thing , total device integration . it almost demands that you go out and buy a XBOX i do not even play games . Nuff said . Not sure how many stars but the product did work and activate not I will buy again .#### #### ####[([47, 48], [49], 'POS'), ([47, 48], [143, 144], 'POS'), ([138, 139], [49], 'POS'), ([138, 139], [143, 144], 'POS')]
At home I upgraded a Vista machine to Windows 8 and then to 8.1 . It took a good while to learn to use Windows 8 / 8.1 . Windows 8.1 is an improvement over 8 . I still use Windows 7 at work . At this point I do n't really have a preference between 7 or 8.1 , but getting comfortable with Windows 8 / 8.1 was not easy . I did for a while use a shell application to provide the Start Menu , but it was buggy and slow . I eventually uninstalled the shell. < br />< br /> Hoping Windows 10 is the answer .#### #### ####[([80], [90], 'NEU'), ([80], [92], 'NEU'), ([80], [33], 'NEU'), ([80], [69, 70], 'NEU'), ([85], [90], 'NEU'), ([85], [92], 'NEU'), ([85], [33], 'NEU'), ([85], [69, 70], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], [90], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], [92], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], [33], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], [69, 70], 'NEU'), ([64, 65], [90], 'NEU'), ([64, 65], [92], 'NEU'), ([64, 65], [69, 70], 'NEU'), ([84, 85], [90], 'NEU'), ([84, 85], [92], 'NEU'), ([84, 85], [69, 70], 'NEU'), ([105, 106], [33], 'NEU')]

I like that this version actually worked for me . The 2014 version was spotty at best . This one so far does work . The only negative I have about this version happened when I changed ISP 's recently , and subsequently network IP addresses changed , ( Thanks Uverse for not letting my router and your router work on the same network ) Acronis could no longer find my NAS drives , I was able to quickly rebuild the tasks and all is back to running smooth again .

I have been using Cook'n since version 1 , I think . I started out using Master Chef . It was very hard to use . Cook'n is amazing . It has an interface that allows you to import recipes from multiple sources . The manual input for recipes is about as easy to use as it can be . You can build your cookbook any way you want , with chapters that you set up and name . You can search many different ways including just in your cookbook or the entire internet . You can attach pictures and notes . You can even file tips with no recipe . I used to have over 100 cookbooks ; my wife was military and travelled about 75 % of the time , globally . Every country or state that she visited , she bought me a cookbook . I now have about 5 . I rely on Cook'n completely . You can purchase ( at a discount ) or use a coupon code for a free cookbook every month . The entire cookbook is download to the Cook'n database . After importing it , you can move your favorites to your personal cookbook . Cook'n is a great piece of software for active cooks . There is a menu planner and a grocery list formulator , as well . The software works on PC , Mac , phones and iPads . Very versatile .#### #### ####[([24], [207], 'POS'), ([24], [28], 'POS'), ([33], [207], 'POS'), ([33], [28], 'POS'), ([33], [242], 'POS'), ([45, 46], [52], 'POS'), ([230], [207], 'POS'), ([230], [28], 'POS'), ([230], [242], 'POS')]

Words cannot describe how ill and angry the new version of TI 2015 make me . Read all the other one star reviews , and it 's all in there , no need for me to duplicate the comments . Impossible to use in a meaningful way , particularly on a Lenovo W540 . There is no dashboard on the Lenovo , so you NEVER know what is happening ( no HD light ) , and how the backup is performing . It all workarounds trying to to get performance ...... and the critical ... restore if you are lucky . Before 2015 , restore was easy . The preferences are no longer there , but some obscure new name and functions. < br />< br /> The Metro interface is a disaster . Colors bleed into the background .

I like this version but I have a few complaints . The features that were in previous version of Manga Studio are absent . I notice I cannot create a project with more than one page like I could in version 3 . If you want a project with more than one page and be able to print a story you need the EX version . Other than that I love Manga Studio 5 . It is perfect for a hobbyist like me and at a price I actually find reasonable . EX version is better but you 'll pay more for it . I recommend EX if money is no object or you happen to be a professional comic artist. < br /> I also like the painting features . I do n't find the 3D characters and environments useful at all . But I guess they 're good if you like to create comics with 3D figures . I just do n't know if it is possible to import your own 3D models and characters in this version of Manga Studio 5 .

There is no better way to organize recipes . Before Cook'n , I would copy recipes on letter size sheets and stored the in three 3 &# 34 ; loose leaf notebooks . I do menus two weeks at a time and finding what I wanted was a nightmare . Now everything is on my computer ( iMac 27 ) . I quickly scan the contents of my cookbooks in Cook'n , or I can search for recipes with particular ingredients . I decide on the meals and then schedule them on my calendar app and print out the calendar . The best thing is that you do n't need to print out any recipes . I have the iPhone and iPad apps so I just bring the recipe up on my iPad , put on the stand and use it right in the kitchen . All of these devices sync with the Cook'n cloud so you have your recipes wherever you go .

This Antivirus software is a must have to protect your computer and other devices . You can use this software to protect your computer , android cell phone , etc . You can protect any of your 5 devices in any combination you want . I have used Kaspersky products for over 15 years and will not use any other program . For those of you new to Kaspersky products this program is easy to install , just follow the step by step instructions . Before installation always uninstall current antivirus programs that may interfere with the installation . What I choose to do every year is to uninstall the previous years Kaspersky software using the computer uninstall program , then I do a new install with the new software . Or , you can purchase a new license from Kaspersky and use that instead . I have found that you can load Kaspersky into your android phone two ways : by using a QR Scanning app to scan from the Kaspersky booklet provided . Or you can go up to Kaspersky and download to your android phone the software and put in the product code for your license .

The software works well , and has a decent user interface . However , customer support weighs heavily for me and theirs is awful . The software is overseas , which never sits well with me . The call center is very noisy and the rep had a * very * thick accent , making communication hard . He kept repeating over & over some script about how they are providing support for Malwarebytes making it obvious that they were providing support for numerous other software products as well . But he must have said this 6-8 times every time I asked a question or made a comment he could n't respond to. < br />< br /> I recently purchased a 3-computer license . My call was to find out how to transfer a license from a laptop no longer being used to a desktop that was replacing it . The rep once again - repeated his mantra , and then wanted to remote into my new computer to &# 34 ; diagnose &# 34 ; it . I firmly mentioned there was nothing wrong with the computer and I just needed to transfer a license . He insisted the only way he could help me was to remote in and make sure it was compatible . I assured him it was and that I would not allow him to remote in . Finally after a few volleys of this , I said no thank you and hung up . Five minutes later , I found out how to deactivate and transfer the license online .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [8], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [56], 'POS')]

Quickbooks Sucks . I * had * to upgrade from 2012 , because they would n't let me download bank information if I did n't . I at least expected the software to be less buggy or faster or add some features . Welp my expectations turned out to be waaaayyyy tooooo higghhhhh . Next time I 'll know better and expect the software to be no less than 20 % more difficult to use than the previous version . I do n't think they can find a way to disappoint then -- although they 'll probably find a way . Other than making frequently used features hard to use and activate , there 's nothing special about this upgrade . They were kind enough to hide things like bank feeds and balances in new places ( that I do n't believe you can move ) , and provided us with all kinds of new error messages popping up about where my files are stored on the drive and which sequence of events I did wrong this time . It seems to be the same bug-filled software as always with a different shell so that they can claim , &# 34 ; look at all the updates we 've made &# 34 ; to justify their price. < br />< br /> I certainly commend them for finding a way to make a consistently crappy product worse . I commend them even more for finding a way to force consumers to buy their product despite the fact that it is no better than it was 3 years ago , and finally : congratulations for keeping all decent competition out of the marketplace so that we 're all stuck with this sloppy mess of accounting software because there is no alternative . I feel like a pre-Gorbachev Russian begging for a morsel of something better than stale bread . NYET !< br />< br /> And that 's not all . . . their payroll sucks too . Be very careful giving this company your credit card information because a $ 225 dollar purchase , may become an over $ 400 renewal . They thought they * got * me , but my credit card company honored my dispute and refunded my money to which Intuit replied via e-mail , &# 34 ; We consider this a balance due &# 34 ; or something close . The only reason I had to dispute the charge was that their customer disservice department refused to process the cancellation ; instead requiring me to start over and call a different department . I said no thanks and handled the way I hope everyone handles it when they over charge . If we all play duck duck goose trying to find a customer service rep empowered to cancel service we never ordered , then finally give up and write off the $$ , they will continue to operate exactly as they currently do.dispute the charge was that their customer disservice department refused to process the cancellation ; instead requiring me to start over and call a different department .

The 100 % Truth about this OS is that it is a very early version of Windows XP PRO , and one that has a good deal of XP Home in it too . Recognizing this fact that it might be , I had a professional computer Expert load it for me . This program is missing all of the required main drivers to make it work properly , but which he loaded in from the Internet . This version is the very earliest of the XP programs coming directly from NT & Windows 2000 . It cost me an extra $ 110.00 to make it work which it does nicely for me now , but all I wanted to use it for is to run the old Microsoft style games that either they produced or Sierra did originally . While the gentleman also loaded a driver in to take me on the Internet in a LAN connection for DSL , I personally would NOT recommend you do it , because it is a very outdated OS system still recognizing Internet Explorer # 6 . This OS system by itself is practically worthless , but still fun if you do it the way I did , then it runs fine . Also , there is no working writing program unless you happen to have a copy of something like Windows Office 97 like I do . That should work fine . As yet I have not researched for an old style printer with a usable driver that will work IF one still exists (?).< br />< br /> I might add , that I 've already had & used an updated version of XP PRO from 2007 that is much more refined , and worked better and was from IBM instead of ' Dell ' and lasted for me until the hard drive died last year in June of 2014 . Then I began with Lubuntu ( a < br /> Linux system OS ) on a new hard drive , and now I own 2 computers using different operating systems. < br />< br /> So the end result is --- You can buy this old OS , but unless you know Exactly how to set it up for yourself , then plan on spending + $ 100.00 to get someone else to do it for you . Of course , you can always purchase a brand new copy of a more recent XP PRO for upwards of $ 300.00 and get a clean copy that ' may ' have everything . It 's your choice. < br />< br /> Thank you .#### #### ####[([62], [56], 'POS'), ([176, 177], [175], 'POS'), ([176, 177], [295], 'POS'), ([186, 187], [175], 'POS'), ([186, 187], [192], 'POS'), ([255], [175], 'POS'), ([255], [192], 'POS'), ([311, 312], [56], 'POS'), ([311, 312], [313], 'POS')]

I can say that this is the best Windows ever . it has all the things which many People critized in Win8 ( Start menu , Desktop Focus ) and also the cool Things / ideas in which Win8 evolved . Additionally they added some cool Features like virtual Desktops ( yes i know they have been available in Linux for years , but that doesnt make it bad , or not ?) , Continuum , Cortana and Notification Center , and many more small Things. < br />< br /> The UI has evolved in the last weeks like i would never have thought , and the Insider Programm is a very innovative and transparent idea , thanks to Gabe Aul and his Team .

Ideally , software that trains you to read music should have a rhythm-only mode , a notes-only mode ( wait for note ) , and a rhythm-and-notes-together mode . Of the currently-available software titles for training yourself to read score , the ones I 've found to be good are Adventus Piano Suite ( which has all three of the modes I just described ) , Piano Marvel , and Etude Sight Reader . The best software I 've used for training in sight reading is the Miracle Piano Teaching System , which is now unfortunately discontinued . So , all things considered , I 'd say that Adventus Piano Suite is arguably the best currently-available score-reading software . The main window is not resizable but there are three zoom levels that help with that . The modes take a moment to get used to , the software would benefit from keyboard shortcuts and a bit of UI redesign ( it is quite old now for software ) but none of those things are serious enough to detract even a single star . And for its primary purpose which is to teach you to read music and train you to do that quickly , it has absolutely everything you 'd need and it does it well . Despite its outdated appearance this is a very solid piece of Windows programming . Which brings me to another consideration , which is that Adventus Piano Suite is Windows-only . I can see that Piano Marvel , which benefits from the broad reach that all browser-based software does , has a wider audience than Windows users . But Piano Marvel ( at time of writing ) lacks the features of Adventus Piano Suite . And being a web app , rather than native , it 's likely a little more prone to stability and performance issues . I have n't seen any perf or latency issues with Adventus Piano Suite . I have a Korg M3 with firewire connected to my PC . Also , even though the title is probably 20 years old , it works without any problem on Windows 8.1 ( you have to download the HTML Help viewer separately , but Windows will guide you through that process the first time to try to access the Help menu ) . Knowing some of the differences between Win8.1 and Win10 , I 'd be surprised if this title does not work just as well on Windows 10 , also . If you do n't want to buy it used from Amazon , go to the adventus website and buy it there .#### #### ####[([88], [283], 'POS'), ([121], [283], 'POS'), ([285], [283], 'POS'), ([311], [283], 'POS'), ([311], [312], 'POS')]
&# 34 ; Latin is a dead language < br /> As dead as it can be < br /> First it killed the Romans < br /> And now it 's killing me &# 34 ;< br />< br /> Latin , as taught , is dry and pedantic . Yet Ovid viewed it as something with which to pick up girls ; while Martial hurled vicious insults with it . Rosetta Stone introduces us to that sort of Latin . The stuff of everyday life . And I keep with it because that hideous grammar was , nevertheless , something with which they , you know , actually talked. < br />< br /> It is for this intuitive quality that I do not damn this program . Rather , I consign it to purgatory. < br />< br /> First the vocabulary is absurd . Do we really need to know what they , perhaps , might have used for &# 34 ; computer &# 34 ; or &# 34 ; telephone ,&# 34 ; or &# 34 ; airplane &# 34 ; There is some value in wordplay , but Rosetta Stone should emphasize the words found in common textbooks or flash card sets. < br />< br /> And second , it is particularly frustrating when Rosetta Stone tells me I have mispronounced one of these made up words . Really ? Yes , I know that many scholars have beliefs about how Latin was pronounced , and you may agree with them This is not the proper venue for us to debate this . Suffice it to say that Latin is a language that we do not speak but rather read . There is some value in attempting to pronounce it . You thereby use your entire brain , which enhances your comprehension . And which makes Latin more like a &# 34 ; real &# 34 ; language . But constantly to be punished for what Rosetta Stone thinks is a bad accent is absurd . OK , I have a Pompeii accent or sound like some hick from Britannia . Life is short , and I 'd rather be reading Ovid . Which is what I may do if this Rosetta Stone course does not get real .#### #### ####[([96], [95], 'NEG'), ([96], [146], 'NEG'), ([96], [219], 'NEG'), ([96], [338], 'NEG'), ([144], [6], 'NEG'), ([144], [49], 'NEG'), ([144], [95], 'NEG'), ([144], [146], 'NEG'), ([144], [219], 'NEG'), ([144], [306], 'NEG')]

I 've been using quicken h & b for years and love it. the reason i gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because i upgraded for the tablet app and it 's not able to access the full program . I write all my business invoices on quicken and when i 'm out of the office i have the synced app but i 'm only able to access my bank ledgers ....... very disappointing . I hope quicken fixes this soon .#### #### ####[([40], [34, 35], 'POS'), ([40], [75], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [34, 35], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [75], 'POS')]
This product is terrible , and so is the customer service . I thought I could save a few bucks by switching from TurboTax , but it 's not worth it . For one thing , you end up paying for the state file . For another , the whole program is wonky and not nearly as easy to follow as TurboTax . Finally , trying to do an Amended Return is a nightmare . After intense googling to figure out how to do it , I was able to &# 34 ; amend &# 34 ; but cannot find out how to PRINT the amendment ! There is no online web help for that problem -- they demand you call and talk to their Press 1 Press 2 robot , which eventually tells you there is no support available on Sundays . UGH ! ! I ca n't say enough bad things about this product . I would have been better off with paper .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [3], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [73], 'NEG'), ([50], [52], 'NEG'), ([50], [73], 'NEG'), ([69, 70], [57], 'NEG')]
So far , I am quite pleased with this product . It appears to be much better than other Internet Security programs that I have had in the past. < br />< br /> The only other comment I have about this product is that it took forever to download . Maybe it was my computer . But , During the download process it said it would take &# 34 ; about 20 minutes &# 34 ; . It took well over 45 minutes . During other processes it said so many &# 34 ; seconds &# 34 ; . Those seconds turned into SEVERAL minutes . Maybe that information should be updated on the program to accurately reflect how long it really might take . I downloaded this program on two different computers . So , it became annoying . Otherwise , this program would have received FIVE starts .#### #### ####[([19, 20], [139], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [16], 'POS')]

This seems to be a product with a lot of issues . At least under Windows 8 it is frequently crushing , plays sound but no image , does not start properly. < br /> Ending task and starting again does not seem to work and the reboot is required. < br /> The task it is suppose to perform is rather simple and certainly nothing new in computing yet it looks like CyberLink is better at advertising it than making it work properly .

I bought this software from the manufacturer as the Amazon add did not give the version number . Amazon should never allow a merchant to sell software without a version number. < br />< br /> I bought the Standard Version 7.15 from Foxit directly ( i.e. , not the &# 34 ; business &# 34 ; version ) . I think this software is outstanding . I have used Adobe Acrobat Pro for 12 years or more . Bought new Adobe versions about every 2 to 3 years . My latest version ( V8 ) would not load on a new computer and Adobe was no help . Their customer service is terrible. < br />< br /> Foxit PDF is truly excellent software . Much easier to use than Adobe . A couple of customer service contacts the first couple of weeks were excellent and fast . Now , since the price is probably 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the Adobe Acrobat price , that really makes it great .#### #### ####[([63], [123], 'POS'), ([63], [127], 'POS'), ([63], [65], 'POS')]

Installed perfectly , no issues at all . I read many negative reviews ?? ? I 'm thinking it was simply the person may have never installed an operating system before . Any time you install an new O.S. ; it is VERY time consuming because of all the updates after the installation .

I recently started my own business - my first try at it - and after speaking with many people I know who own small businesses , I went with QuickBooks . Almost everyone I spoke to uses it . I know there are other bookkeeping / accounting software products out there , but I have no point of reference with which to judge them . Than being said , I think QuickBooks has been really good for doing what I need it to do . I have a simple , one-man business with no payroll responsibilities .

As an early adopter of officially released 2012 , I may well have received the bug-farm edition ... v.v . 72-hr. crashes or hourly function freezes . After the fiasco of revision 2008 , I had hoped for better from Microsoft ; this has n't been the case . No need for listing the litany of issues : buy it , and you 'll experience them for yourself [ and , expense a Keurig coffee maker and a nice cot for the all nighters ] Since this latest episode , I convinced management that Windows was only a solution for a bygone era . The research team was already on Linux , and support of Widows solely for one subset of users did n't seem prudent . I moved our company to RHEL Linux with WebMin for control , and could n't be happier . I can use CentOS Linux for test build / platforms . No muss of fuss , and much more flexible than WinServ . For users who still need Windows support ( v.v. the bean counters ) , I can use a virtualized copy of WinServe 2008 for cover ... easy peasy . Eventually , I figure on collapsing Windows everything .

I was tempted to give this three stars just because I 've learned how bad overall card game software seems to be , and this may be better than most if you 're looking for specific non-solitaire games . I bought this and SolSuite ( the download of the free trial version is available via a &# 34 ; sponsored &# 34 ; link on Amazon or you can easily find their web site ) a while ago when I accidentally deleted all the Microsoft games from my old XP laptop . If you 're looking for solitaire games , SolSuite is vastly better. < br />< br /> I bought the 2008 version of Hoyle after reading reviews here , saying it 's preferable to the later versions . It seems like very old-fashioned clunky software that 's in need of a total overhaul . It 's slow . It sometimes freaks out and does strange things on my Win 7 laptop , though it 's never actually crashed . It takes up my whole screen so I ca n't do anything else while it 's open . . . I ca n't find any way to minimize it or change the size . . . maybe there 's a way around that , but I have n't found it . The music plays the same short snippets of pieces over and over . Very annoying , so I turned it off . The settings do n't always seem to hold - for example , I kept trying to increase the the number of shuffles allowed on a game . Eventually this &# 34 ; took &# 34 ; for some unknown reason and it 's working now . But until it did , it kept announcing that the game was over and shutting it down long before I 'd intended. < br />< br /> In addition , this software , unless I 'm missing something , is n't good for learning games if you do n't already know them . SolSuite has pretty good game instructions , statistics on difficulty and so forth , and it also has a &# 34 ; hint &# 34 ; option , which I find very useful when I 'm learning a new game . I would like to find software for games other than solitaire that has aids of that type . My main reason for buying the Hoyle was to try to learn new games , but that 's not gonna happen. < br />< br /> So I would say if you already know how to play a non-solitaire card game you ca n't find elsewhere and your tolerance for a fairly primitive interface is high , this may be okay for you . But I would n't recommend it for anything else . It seems as though it was designed for DOS and never really made the leap to Windows !#### #### ####[([136], [135], 'NEG'), ([136], [236], 'NEG'), ([136], [454], 'NEG'), ([100], [236], 'NEG'), ([100], [346], 'NEG'), ([100], [454], 'NEG'), ([223], [236], 'NEG'), ([223], [454], 'NEG'), ([455], [135], 'NEG'), ([455], [236], 'NEG'), ([455], [454], 'NEG')]

When you buy the software other than the manufacturer , Acronis makes you pay the cost saving by torturing you with zillions of questions to validate your purchase . They are extremely neurotic in suspecting all non direct sales could be people who steal their software . Yes , it is not easy product to use . But it is definitely more reliable than the old Norton Ghost before Symantec retires . From what I read on reviews , I did not dare to try Symantec 's newer backup software. < br />< br /> I did test the restore on both of my PC 's . It does work flawlessly . If you want to restore one or more files , it took a little working to figure it out .

Up till a few weeks ago I was using Quicken 2007 and it was great . I have one checking account that goes back to 1994 . I must have gone through three or four Quicken versions and they all worked .

Be extra careful with the software . You might be trapped for a continues paying schedule . I wish I have seen the Users review before I purchased full version of the Parallel Desktop software . Then I wo n't really do it . I am not a computer expert , but I have pretty good experience with PC and Mac . when I got my mac , I still have some paid full version of software which for PC I use , that 's the reason I considered a friend suggestion . He showed me his brand new Mac computer and the software he bought . I thought was nice . Then I went out and bought a full version to install it on my Mac . It has been working , But it always ask me to upgrade of course pay for them . I did n't need the &# 34 ; new features &# 34 ; so I did n't . But now when Mac upgrade to current Yosemite the Parallel does n't work due to Virtual machine function . I ca n't not use the Parallels . I contact the customer support team . This is where the trouble begins . The support team was very consist on their phone manner , and as well as their suggestion -- Money . all of them want me to pay full price for an other version of the software , because they do not support some older version of their software . I left my contact info to them , they said they will call back . some did . Some just never did . after quiet a few phone calls and e-mails . There was one Customer support manager replied and offer me an 8 dollars discount . I thought They were joking at the beginning , but it turn out that their manager could n't make any decision more than 8 dollars ! What a bit company ! I told them I feel they do n't even take customer inquiry seriously , and felt very back about their system user experience . Then they manager promised me to call me back in 24 hrs to see if any possible solutions . But he lied , no one called and no e-mail was sent . I wo n't buy their product again .

There is often a 2 second pause between words in a sentence . For example , &# 34 ; Literally ( pause pause pause ) then ( pause pause pause ) it means ( pause pause pause ) He is well &# 34 ; . Instructor ( native english speaker ) pronounces pronunciation as ' pronounce iation ' . There is a Match the Words exercise but nothing on the screen allows you to match the words and the instructions do n't address how to make the exercise function . In the Write the Words exercise , the question does not differentiate between singular or plural YOU so you have no way of knowing if you should answer tu or vous . On the good side , this software seems to require less mouse usage than Rosetta . Rosetta requires a lot of positioning the mouse and clicking while this software often allows use of right arrow key to advance . But Fluenz does require the mouse to again and again make the language subtitle choice so the advantage may be lost .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEG'), ([1], [8], 'NEG'), ([228, 229], [227], 'NEG')]

There 's this windows 8 stigma going around because people do n't know how to get to their desktop view . But when you do learn how to do it , its great. < br />< br /> To be serious here , this is the best version of windows I 've ever used . Its very powerful , its fast , and I 've never had this version of windows crash on me . This is Microsoft trying to further their technology , and people hated it because they changed it a lot . &# 34 ; If it ai n't broke do n't fix it &# 34 ; mentality really does hold back tech . But the ' tablet ' view is really geared for a touch screen , and it is kinda neat . I mainly use it for smartglass. < br />< br /> One thing I like is , you do not need a SSD for the OS on this one , unless you like fractions of seconds shaved off . This OS loads up from a cold boot in mere seconds . Roughly around 4 seconds . Longest , maybe 7 , at most . So unless you 're gaming and want faster load times , an SSD is n't needed for most people. < br />< br /> What is also nice , it includes both a x32 and a x64 version of windows . So take your choice , choose x64 if you have 2GB of RAM or more. < br />< br /> If you are wondering why you would also get this now ? You get a free key for windows 10 , which I am very excited about . Other then that , I have no negative views about Windows 8 .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [135], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [208], 'POS')]

First , the link provided within the McAfee folder with the Key card does n't work . I had to search for other solution to find the McAfee page with the product activation field so I could enter the key code and download the software ( expectantly ?) . However , the key code did not work ! Spent almost two hours on the phone with Intel / McAfee only to have them decide they could not confirm that I purchased the retail key card with access code and refer me back to Amazon . In general , the McAfee site was not helpful ... its only a store front to sell , sell , sell . On the other hand , Amazon was GREAT . Within about two minutes they credited my account for the purchase and told me to throw away the useless card . Not sure what &# 34 ; Online Tech Group &# 34 ; is selling , but it did n't work and wasted my time .

It seems that a lot of the hate for Windows 8 is based around the Start Screen . Luckily , you can download programs that give you the Start Menu back . Also you can boot to the desktop and entirely bypass the Start Screen , so those issues can easily be taken care of . The fact that it 's not the default option on desktop platforms is inexcusable , but the option is there and it is easy to resolve . In fact , you never have to use the Start Screen at all . I certainly do n't anyway . If you are an advanced user there are even more tweaks to get Windows 8 the way you want it to be. < br />< br /> Yes Microsoft made some mistakes with Windows 8 , but it is hardly unusable . I am not a fan of the UI , as I preferred the classic look which is unfortunately gone and no replacement is available . Some of the behavior of Windows 8 is inconsistent as well . However it 's definitely faster than Windows 7 . I 've had no crashes or issues so far either . Granted I only had maybe one crash on Windows 7 in over three years of use so it 's been comparable in terms of stability so far . I like Windows 8 a lot more than I thought I would . It just needed time to mature and for MS to realize that this is NOT what people wanted , initially anyway , from a desktop OS . Hopefully Windows 10 will resolve all the issues users had with Windows 8 .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [79], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [143], 'POS'), ([15, 16], [7], 'POS'), ([15, 16], [143], 'POS')]

SmartDraw CI is a diagramming software for Windows which ships with lots of templates , e. g. for floor plans , flowcharts , and calendars . My first impression of the trial version was very positive because the user interface looks modern and I hoped that SmartDraw would be easy to use . But I soon ran into problems . * The user interface might appear modern , but most dialogue boxes look like a reincarnation of ancient Windows 98 . * You want to export to PDF ? SmartDraw will install a printer driver to accomplish this . * Exporting to Microsoft Word 2010 results in a document containing a picture which means that you cannot edit it besides adjusting contrast , brightness etc . To change the labels or something else , you have to edit the SmartDraw document and export it again . * At your first Excel import ( e. g. to obtain data for a bar chart ) , an ActiveX component is installed . * According to the current ( 2015 ) User Guide , you need Visio to import Visio documents . My trial version behaved differently . SmartDraw CI apparently sends your Visio document to a Web server , converts it , and sends it back to you . Or it is supposed to do this , for the trial version could not connect to the server . * You cannot use SVG with SmartDraw . * Although there is a huge amount of templates , there is no support for bubble charts . * Besides some pre-sets , I could not find any options for 3d bar charts . ( The Perspective Export mentioned in the User Guide is something different and was not available either . ) *** For my purposes , SmartDraw CI offers to few features for too much money . Microsoft Office 2010 is cheaper and supports PDF , bubble charts and 3d bar charts . If you are looking for an affordable alternative , try Edraw Max 7.9 . It supports SVG , exports to PDF and Microsoft Office ( resulting in a drawing which you can edit within Word ) , is compatible with Visio and has a modern user interface featuring ribbons.has a modern user interface featuring ribbons .#### #### ####[([63], [41], 'NEU'), ([63], [66], 'NEU'), ([63], [379], 'NEU'), ([38, 39], [41], 'NEU'), ([38, 39], [66], 'NEU'), ([38, 39], [379], 'NEU'), ([46], [49], 'NEU'), ([46], [58], 'NEU'), ([46], [238], 'NEU'), ([46], [367], 'NEU'), ([62, 63], [41], 'NEU'), ([62, 63], [66], 'NEU'), ([62, 63], [379], 'NEU'), ([123], [49], 'NEU'), ([123], [58], 'NEU'), ([123], [367], 'NEU'), ([165, 166], [292, 293], 'NEU'), ([165, 166], [367], 'NEU'), ([121], [49], 'NEU'), ([121], [58], 'NEU'), ([121], [238], 'NEU'), ([121], [367], 'NEU')]

I finally broke down and ordered the latest version because the very old version I had used for many years would n't run with Windows 7 . I was surprised by how much the program had changed . The features are mostly the same , you just wo n't recognize them because the way to use nearly everything has changed . It was a pretty painful relearning process , but I 'm getting up to speed . The other thing I was surprised about was that the same bugs that were in my 20 year old version are pretty much the same ones in this new version . For instance , if you do a copy / paste operation , do n't change the view or craziness starts to happen . That 's just one example of the bugs that are amazingly still present in this & quot ; upgraded & quot ; version . The one redeeming feature it still does have is that if the program loses its mind , you can still do a save and all is well . However , it gets to be extremely annoying to have to restart the program all the time though .#### #### ####[([24, 25], [20, 21], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], [190], 'NEU'), ([34], [36], 'NEU'), ([34], [190], 'NEU'), ([39], [190], 'NEU')]

Parallels 10 is great , not only for running Windows inside Yosemite -- which , thankfully , I do n't have to do -- but for running Mac OS 10.6 , Snow Leopard , inside Yosemite . That I DO need to do : it enables me to run legacy software which Apple left high and dry when it made the baffling decision to stop supporting Rosetta after Snow Leopard . This runs regularly and reliably , every single day , unlike my attempts with VMWare Fusion and even earlier versions of Parallels , all of which were very unstable or unusable for one reason or another . One caveat : if you want to run OS 10.6 inside Parallels , you must buy a copy of Snow Leopard Server , NOT the regular Snow Leopard ; Parallels did not get a ULA for regular Snow Leopard and so , it is not supported . But Snow Leopard Server IS supported and works beautifully .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [3], 'POS'), ([0, 1], [163], 'POS')]

I have been a fan of WordPerfect since the old DOS based WP5.1 . I believe it is a far superior product to Word . The ability to format is vastly superior , primarily because of the reveal,codes feature , , which allows you to see exactly what formatting has been applied at precise spots in the document . The ability to type a document was also superior , as virtually all commands could be entered from the keyboard , without the need to slow down typing to wrestle with the mouse , drop down menus , etc. < br />< br /> WordPerfect fell out of favor as the world moved to Windows and graphics interfaces . The Microsoft marketing juggernaut convinced everyone to switch to Word , which over the years became more and more bloated with features which no one uses , but which require three or four clicks to accomplish simple things like changing paragraph layouts. < br />< br /> In recent years , WordPerfect has fought back , adding graphics interfaces,while retaining the simple interface which I loved . X7 continues this tradition . Fully compatible with Word ( so you can import all your friends screwed up Word documents , and return them in Word readable format ) , it still,retains the reveal codes and other features I love . Nice step up from the X5 I had been using , but more relevantly , light years ahead of any version of Word .#### #### ####[([139], [137], 'POS'), ([180], [20], 'POS'), ([180], [31], 'POS'), ([180], [179], 'POS'), ([223], [67], 'POS')]

When I was a kid , I obsessively played the shareware version of this game , which only included the first table ( Super Android ) . I 've always wondered what the other tables were like -- and now I know !< br />< br /> I may be biased because of nostalgia , but I think Super Android is the best table of the bunch : it 's got lots of ramps and targets , good graphics , a decent amount of challenge , and on-screen instructions to guide you through each of the objectives . As for the non-shareware tables , the gameplay is pretty good , but not quite as compelling. < br />< br /> There is a * lot * of variation between tables , with things like flipper sizes , table features , and score readouts varying from table to table . Each one really feels like a different computer game ! As a result , some of the tables have grown on me ( I * really * like Excalibur at the moment ; Deep and Sea is good , as well as Crash and Burn ) , but some of the others have n't . It 's hard to describe , but Enigma , Space Journey , and Toy Factory feel &# 34 ; cheap &# 34 ; or &# 34 ; flimsy &# 34 ; , like I 'm playing a free online game. < br />< br /> Also of note : I got the jewel case with informational booklet . The &# 34 ; expert tips &# 34 ; are n't spectacular , and the writing has a couple of typos ... so do n't feel bad if you do n't have the booklet . However , the booklet did give me a greater appreciation of what Epic Pinball tried to be : a collection of * various styles * of pinball tables of different , inspired by both old and modern tables in real life . On that front , I think Epic did fairly well. < br />< br /> Overall , I 'm glad that I finally bought the full version , even though it was n't as awesome as I expected . If you 're on the fence , I recommend trying out the shareware version , which you can still get from DOS shareware sites .

I was copying images to it from a Mac when I noticed that some of the thumbnails were not displaying as images on the SSD drive , when I clicked on them no image appeared. < br /> I ejected the disk then reconnected it , but the disk icon did not appear. < br /> I tried it on another Mac , still nothing. < br /> I searched the net for solutions , spoke to a lot of tech people ; there are a lot of people out there with a lot of ideas , but none seemed as convincing as Data Rescue. < br /> So I emailed their support team and received a swift reply saying that they thought Data Rescue might well be able to retrieve my data. < br /> I live in the UK , and Data Rescue is n't sold here as yet , so I ordered it directly from the Prosoft website and downloaded it. < br /> I ran the software with my fingers firmly crossed . The first scan came up with nothing at all , but suggested I do a longer and more thorough scan , which I did . After about half an hour or so the scan of the drive resulted in Data Rescue retrieving 100 % of my data from the damaged drive. < br /> I then ran Disk Warrior which fixed the b tree structure on the drive , and then extracted the data too , but disk warrior could not retrieve all the data , whereas Data Rescue had retrieved it all , even on a then still damaged / un-repaired disk. < br /> This is a wonderful piece of software from a company with a very fine support team . I simply cannot recommend it more highly. < br /> Thank you Data Rescue 4 .#### #### ####[([300], [297], 'POS'), ([300], [287], 'POS'), ([309], [307], 'POS'), ([309], [29], 'POS'), ([309], [29, 30], 'POS'), ([27], [29, 30], 'POS'), ([59, 60], [29, 30], 'POS'), ([59, 60], [62], 'POS')]

I used Ear Master Pro 5 years ago and realize that my ear was not developing , I stopped using the program . Then here comes EarMaster Pro 6 . It boasts of its unique sight-singing and melody imitation feature . There is even a Youtube Video of Hans Jakobsen using the sight-singing feature . A little bit about my life . In my music program at York University , they had the first year students sight-singing and I was terrible at it , but wanting to improve . After the winter semester , I bought this program , thinking it will help me with my problems with singing pitches . However , due to technical difficulties with I do n't know the microphone , the configuration , or basically my inexperience with singing pitches . It just defeats the purpose of why I bought this program. < br />< br /> The program always marks my answers wrong in the sight-singing and melody imitation feature . Even simple do re mi melodies , even though I am singing the correct pitch , it would be marked as wrong . There was one time I spend 28 attempts singing literally a do re mi melody and it was marked as wrong . Makes me look stupid , makes me feel bad about myself . The company declared that EarMaster is a patient , non-judgmental teacher . More like having Simon Cowell judging my &# 34 ; awfully dreadful &# 34 ; singing voice. < br />< br /> The pros of this program are the Melodic Dictation and Interval Singing Feature . I am progressing with these features . My only problem with Interval Singing is that it records unnecessary pitches that I did n't sing . I was able to solve that using the eraser in the toolbox . Or else this program would be a load of Bull-crap. < br />< br /> For the sight-singing , I solved that problem by joining Mark O'Leary's sight singing school online . I am progressing much faster in sight singing than Ear Master. < br />< br /> Overall , I stopped using EarMaster years ago , because it focuses on interval training . The exercises are artificial and not found in real music . Interval Training is a heresy taught in many music schools . I discovered that Keycenter Tonality Internalisation by singing the pitches and listening is the correct method to train your ear. < br />< br /> EarMaster and Auralia are , both expensive and a waste of money . Not recommended.ter Tonality Internalisation by singing the pitches and listening is the correct method to train your ear . EarMaster and Auralia are , both expensive and a waste of money .

I 've been using YNAB for 9 months . This software has been the single largest catalyst for improving not only my financial situation , but also improving my marriage ! Personal finance is more personal than finance , and my wife and I continuously struggled with when it was okay to spend money . We are both naturally frugal so we were more inclined to pass on purchases than overspend . This may seem good at first thought , but it caused a lot of frustration . Even though we keep a fairly large bank balance , we never knew how all the money was allocated . YNAB solved this problem by forcing us to assign every dollar a job ( rule 1 ) . By &# 34 ; spending &# 34 ; each dollar when we got paid , we could essentially know , within reason , where the money would GO instead of later wondering where it WENT .

Performed a clean install using this software on a 9-year old Dell Inspiron 530s desktop and it worked perfectly . Note one needs to back up all files one wants to keep because a clean install will reformat the hard drive . XP was working ok , but with all the notes on XP support going away , I thought I 'd try an upgrade . I decided to try Windows 8 since it is newer and that was a disaster . It is so bad that Microsoft gives you 8.1 for free . However , 8.1 was only better from the standpoint of being able to easily shut down the computer which I never could figure out with 8 . And the monitor resolution had problems and there are no driver upgrades for my Dell monitor in 8 / 8.1 ( nor would a new monitor work according to Dell ) . The various tips to use in Windows 8 / 8.1 to improve monitor resolution would not work . ( I wasted my money with Windows 8 . ) Windows 7 even updated the monitor driver automatically . The computer is now working faster than with XP and the monitor resolution is correct . I will be more careful in deciding what Microsoft product to upgrade with in the future .

Finally got a refund and to the correct person to order the software that I wanted and after 3 tries of running a card and me saying I would just call later and try again they call me back not once but twice asking for another try at it and they had finally figured out they were running the card incorrectly .

NOPE. < br /> I spend a couple hours creating an awesome little template with our company logo and everything we need. . I loved this idea because doing an acknowledgment through the invoicing system immediately hit my A / R and I also ended up having to do multiple invoices ( 30 % deposit , 70 % remainder + whatever terms )< br />< br /> Well , I finish my template and guess what , It decides to put about half my changes in .

Called in a specialist. . 4 hours and 350 dollars later he 's telling me &# 34 ; I 'd call them if I were you and pitch a fit till they fix this !&# 34 ;< br />< br /> Turned out there was a setting that is almost invisible and you have to check boxes for each new item and list wether you want it on-screen only , printable , or both . Only reason I found that was because I had given up and started clicking randomly. < br />< br /> When all is said and done. . if you have incredibly minimal billings , payable and need to shoot out a PO or Invoice from time to time , sure , go ahead and get this inferior software .

Acronis True Image is a great backup program . Perfect it is not . If one of the files in the backup set gets deleted outside of Acronis , the program will see an error and the whole backup scheme will need to be reset .

I have been using Cook'n since it first became available . In the beginning I found it easy to use . DVO has continued to improve Cook'n . I particularly like that it only take 1 or 2 letters and up pops the ingredients . So-o-o-o easy . I like that it has a degree symbol and that you can import a picture of the results for what ever you are making . It can be backed up on the cloud. < br /> But what I like ( a very important benefit ) is the outstanding support. < br /> I hope you will enjoy Cook'n as much as I have#### #### ####[([21], [25], 'POS'), ([19], [17], 'POS')]

This software is simply a dependable way to convert pdf and other formatted graphics to dwg format for additions to existing drawings using AutoCAD . It seems to be designed well and I have used it hundreds of times to introduce simple graphic blocks to my drawings from other formats . I do not recall any failings or glitches which are typical for these types of custom software . I mostly use this to convert my drawings from . pdf to dwg where the pdf versions only use 10 percent of the disc space as compared to dwg versions .

I 've not had good luck with Norton products on the Mac , and long ago stopped installing their utility programs that caused my computer to crash or freeze up. < br />< br /> As reviews from third-party websites have reported , it 's a more robust ( downloadable software ) package for the PC platform than the Mac . The sticking point is that when compared to the other similar products on the marketplace for the Mac , this one falls short . One website noted that its malware detection rate was 54.7 percent , whereas some of its competitors was 100 %.< br />< br /> The good news : This is good for up to ten devices. < br />< br /> The bad news : For macs , its protection value is less than robust. < br />< br /> Recommendation : Shop around and find another Mac product to protect against malware. < br />< br /> I 've been using WEBROOT SECURE and prefer it over any other product .#### #### ####[([49, 50], [47], 'NEU'), ([90, 91], [137, 138], 'NEU')]

This version does just what it says it does , but here is why i only gave it 4 stars : 1 ) they tout a backup your computer to the cloud . My ISP only allows 250GB of upload / download a month . My PC is over 300GB so the cloud backup would never work for a lot of users . it would be too costly from all angles . 2 ) there used to be a ' build restore disk ' feature which I cannot find in the new version , but instead you can download a free universal restore application . I tried it to see if i could restore my PC and the first thing it did after booting from a CD I built is ask me where the mouse and keyboard drivers were . How am i supposed to know where they are ? ? I could not restore my backed up PC . it is on my list to try to figure out some more how to do that with this new version .

I 've been using Windows 10 for over a month now ( btw this is the first version to be used Woodley by the public to test everything and add me features based on user feedback BEFORE release . Microsoft is really working to please users. < br />< br /> Many new features have been added , but Cortana , Continuum , and the Edge Brower are great . Cortana has passive listening do I can get answers to questions , set up a reminder , send an email , or schedule an appointment . All without touching a mouse or keyboard or stopping what I 'm currently working on on my computer. < br />< br /> Continuum is wonderful for anyone with a 2 in 1 , seamlessly switches from desktop friendly to tablet friendly. < br />< br /> The Edge browser is faster , Cortana automatically provides useful information , you can mark up web page with your noted and share them . It 's a step above any other browser. < br />< br /> The UI is gorgeous . The flat design looks modern and make everything easy to use. < br />< br /> My favorite new feature is streaking my Xbox one games to any windows 10 pc on the same network . This allows me to play my Xbox anywhere , even in my back yard. < br />< br /> Finally , it 's very fast and smooth . Start up , for me , had been faster than any version of windows , and indeed any ios or android that I 've used. < br />< br /> Many of these reviews on here are flat out lying. < br />< br /> Windows IS NOT GOING TO BE A SUBSCRIPTION . Yes Microsoft is viewing Windows as a service , that does n't mean it will be a subscription based service . ( example : Gmail is also a service , and you do n't pay anything ).< br />< br /> The guy complaining about Microsoft calling him and paying a $ 1000 fine is either lying or got taken for a ride by criminals . He 's obviously a tech newb , and should probably check his credit accounts because it 's likely someone is living the high life off of his ID. < br />< br /> Windows media center is going away , but that 's only because nobody ( or at least not a high enough number of users ) used it. < br />< br /> This is likely the best version of windows since 95 .

The version sold here has _ not _ been translated into English . The game does not work on my Win7 machine , even with the language packs installed . I also tried it on an old WinXP laptop . Same issues . I could be wrong , but I do n't think I am . All the installation screens render the text as gibberish ( not Japanese gibberish , Gibbertian gibberish ) . Once you get the combination of blind clicks correct ( and I worked my way through all of them ) , it installs , with warnings from the OS about the resolution and other settings . When it runs , the splash screen loads , then the menu -- in proper Japanese . Screen resolution looks to be 640 × 480 . Clicking on the first menu item [''''] &# 34 ; From the Beginning &# 34 ; , brings up a snow-falling screen , with an empty dialogue box , and ... there it hangs . Waiting did n't work .

Uh , you are n't buying a product , you are buying a one-year license . However , there is NOTHING on the box that you look at in the store that tells you this !

For what it 's worth . I bought this to use in transcribing prerecorded interviews . It has a learning curve , no doubt . If I were to speak into the microphone , I thought Dragon 13 did an excellent job of getting the words right . However , using it for transcribing on poorly recorded conversations proved frustrating . Not Dragon 's fault but the copy of each interview varied so much in the interview itself and between interviews. < br /> Dragon 13 Premium will transcribe downloaded conversations and it 's very easy to set that up . But the results can be hit or miss depending on the quality of the recorded material. < br /> Now as far as installs , I have three laptops all running either Windows 7 , 7.1 and 8 . I had no trouble at all installing the software on each and using the one serial number provided . The serial number shows up three times on the sticker placed on the sleeve that contains the software so I assumed that meant I could use it on three machines or combinations thereof . But no problem with installs on any of the machines and worked fine upon completion of the install .#### #### ####[([36, 37], [40], 'POS'), ([36, 37], [95], 'POS')]

Works fine and activates just fine . Expect no problems . The disk I received looked like it came off a standard mass CD burner ; it was clearly not Microsoft packaging . This is actually consistent with some OEM marketing arrangements Microsoft has made ; it does not necessarily indicate the product is not genuine .

If that happens , the error will not say your system needs to be connected ; it says your code is not valid .

OEM builder just can NOT be used to upgrade from another version of Windows . After initial install , it will work just like any other Windows disk would on the system where you installed it ( for example , if you need to use it to install drivers or something later ).< br />< br /> In my case , the vendor made a mistake in packaging ; I was shipped a Win Home disk instead of the correct Win Pro disk . The vendor noticed the error even before my copy was delivered , contacted me to explain , and express mailed the correct disk via next-day air ( at no extra cost to me ) . The key code sticker included with the original shipment was still the correct Window Pro license key ; it worked just fine .

Just purchased a new HP laptop and elected to have this Lo / Jack software installed . Now using it for the first time , I find it to be a complete ripoff . First , there was a guarantee of recovery . As it turns out , the guarantee is limited to $ 600 for the first year , and that goes down significantly every year for the four year contract period . Second . The map that is supposed to show where my computer is located is showing it to be somewhere 40 miles from my here . In short , if my laptop gets lost , it will not be recovered , and instead of replacement bucks from a reputable company , I will get 40 % of the computer 's original cost , or 7 % if it happens in year four . Finally , the fact that HP offered this option , lending it credibility ... . well , it goes without saying , I should not have assumed HP would honestly be concerned about the best interests of its customers. < br />< br /> Anyway , save your money . This is a complete scam , in my opinion . It 's not worth a purchase price of even $ 0 , as it has the capacity of doing absolutely nothing more than creating a false sense of security .#### #### ####[([12, 13], [209, 210], 'NEG')]

I got this when I upgraded from Dragon Naturally Speaking 12 to 13 . I did not like it at all . It felt flimsy , as if made with cheap plastic , and it did not fit well . Additionally , the bluetooth is designed so you HAVE to use the USB dongle with it -- even if your computer has bluetooth capabilities . Since my laptop does not have enough USB ports to spare , I was not interested in something that needed to use one -- and since Dragon 13 is made to NOT work correctly with ANY wireless bluetooth headset that does not use a dongle , I went back to Dragon 12 .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [24], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], [30], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], [69], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], [96, 97], 'NEG'), ([43], [96, 97], 'NEG'), ([72, 73], [24], 'NEG'), ([72, 73], [69], 'NEG')]

Although years behind the operating system technology curve , still running XP and Vista , I chose the upgrade to Windows 7 because of my computer ( s ) limitations of CPU speed and Ram . I could not use all the bells and whistles of 8.1 and 10 without upgrading the computers and screens , so 7 was the choice . The installation , although very time consuming with all the downloads , was very straight forward . With just a couple of mouse clicks the Windows 7 desktop looks and acts similar to XP and Vista which was a plus for me . Just a thought , one might want to use an external fan to help with cooling the processor and hard drive ( s ) as they will work overtime on the installation and downloads . Windows 7 is faster in all respects .#### #### ####[([31, 32], [29], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [76, 77], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [143], 'POS'), ([115, 116], [29], 'POS'), ([115, 116], [120], 'POS')]

I 've been using the 2015 version for a couple months now ( upgrade from 2012 ) , and here are my impressions . - Crashy . It crashes regularly . I have n't experienced any data loss ( at least I do n't think I have ) , but how long will that hold up ? Here 's an idea ... how about if you start patching your program ? QB 2012 was throwing updates at me constantly . Not so much with 2015 . - Slow . Loads slowly , backs up even slower . Slow ! - Unintuitive . Your software looks and feels like something I 'd get on a free cd rom back in 1998 . Where are my bank balances ? Oh , in the second shortcut menu , not the &# 34 ; My Shortcuts &# 34 ; menu ! Wait , why do I have two shortcut menus again ? - Clunky . Using this software just feels slow and awkward , like running through a swimming pool . - Ugly . I have a beautiful computer with a beautiful display ... and then here comes Quickbooks ! Firing up this software is like smearing feces on a Rembrandt . I do n't expect accounting software to be beautiful , but come on ... do you have to wear sweats and mandals to the restaurant ? - I do n't trust it . Something weird happened with one of my accounts recently . I loaded up QB 2015 and suddenly one of my credit cards , a card that has been dutifully reconciled every single month for the past 5 years , now will not reconcile because it has some weird transaction inside it that has changed the amounts . That will be fun to unravel . Is this a result of it being &# 34 ; Crashy ?&# 34 ; This is your &# 34 ; Windows Vista &# 34 ; moment , Intuit .

At first glance , this game looks very similar to Panzer General / Panzer Corps , but its not merely an offshoot of these games , but tries to add new elements to the known concept . Most of this works , and for any fan of these games - thats my summary - adds a fresh breeze into the genre and is totally worth playing it. < br /> Now to the details : It features three single player campaigns - a tutorial ( American side ) , a Japanese , and an american campaign . There also some multiplayer scenarios , while you have too unlock the single player scenarios by playing the campaign through. < br /> LIke Panzer Corps , its an operational game - you have a unit core where you can buy infantry , tanks , Artillery and so on and move and attack around hexes . In most scenarios , you operate with land , sea and air units alike , but some - like the famous battles of Coral Sea and Midway - are naval / ar battles . In the land battles , there are the most differences to Panzer Corps . The most important among many differences is that - like , for example in Unity of Command - you have to maintain supply lines to keep your units performance strong . Also , units suffer from battle attrition and need to take a break sometimes to perform at their full strength again . So , especially on the offensive , you need to plan ahead a lot. < br /> The sea battles are very different . Here , there a big differences how to use destroyers , the big surface ships , submarines . Like in the real pacific war , the game changers are your carrier planes and most sea battles deal with that you assign them the right way and also anticipate what the enemy will do with his planes. < br /> Similar to &# 34 ; Afrika Korps &# 34 ; , an expansion of &# 34 ; Panzer Corps &# 34 ; , the maps have plenty of special events if you achieve or miss secondary mission goals . For example , if you shoot down enough japanese planes in the battle of Pearl Harbour as the U.S. , there will be a decline in experience for Japanese air crews in future the scenarios . These events are forme the best thing in the game and add a little surprise to the battles. < br /> For this genre , Order of Battle has relatively good graphics. < br /> I would rate OOB four stars , because there are some cons for me . Otherwise it would be a perfect strategy game. < br /> The main thing is that it is not a very beginner friendly game . Not even because its so difficult , but of presentation Issues . I think for someone who is new to these kind of games , its sometimes hard to figure out how some concepts work . There is a huge tutorial , but even there it starts to get complex very soon while some things , especially attrition and the supply system , are not properly explained. < br /> I also think the game needs still some balancing , an issue that is adressed sometimes in the discussion forums on Steam or the Slitherine site . One example : Its strange , but dive bombers are too &# 34 ; weak &# 34 ; to attack tanks properly while they were used for it a lot on the war. < br /> The campaings are linear and in many cases you fight with both sides on the same theatre . I would have liked to have a little more variety here and that you could chose between different campaing paths. , but I am pretty sure that will be done in the future in expansions .#### #### ####[([547, 548], [552], 'POS')]
6 / 29 / 2015 - I just installed Total Protection a few days ago on a Windows 7 operating PC ( x64Bit ) . Since then my machine gets a blue screen and then shuts down every few minutes after start up . I spent 4 hours with McAfee tech support and they took it off the machine and re-installed it . This did not fix the issue . I had to call back . After another hour on the phone , the tech confirms that McAfee is causing the problem but a Level 2 tech ca n't help me today and maybe 4 days from now will call me to fix this . If I look online , this is a very old problem posted with McAfee over several years . Meanwhile , McAfee is removed off my PC and my PC is running fine but unprotected now for a few days . This has been a nightmare and immense time waster . A serious virus had us remove McAfee from our company years ago .

For our business we did n't need a fancy CAD program . We needed something that would do simple drawings of the areas ( renovations ) within buildings that we could include in our specs . I had tried Autodesk , Rhino , Draftsight , Light something , etc . I would have spent more time learning how to use it than it was worth in our situation . I had been doing very simple ones with my pdf program , can we say not very professional looking ? I downloaded a trial version and was too busy to even try it so I asked for another week extension . Customer support gladly provided . They even wrote me twice during that week to see if I had questions or needed help . Once my trial was finished , I spoke with my boss and told him how easy it was to use . First drawing took less than 20 minutes to complete while a simpler one had taken up to an hour on other software . ( You can make them fancy or simple ) I loved the ease ! Customer support wrote and asked if I was interested in purchasing . I replied that my boss thought it was too costly for something we would not use on a regular basis . SmartDraw customer service called me on the phone and asked what parts I needed and what type of renewals I needed , etc . Asked how much would we be willing to pay for what we needed and worked with us to customize our download to meet our needs and then some , gave us options on future updates or just the one year updates , etc . Never have I ever had such quality service from a software company . I have had no problems at all from the program . It does what I tell it to do . I saw some reviews of it being cranky ...

The concept is great , and there are features that , if they worked correctly , would be very helpful . But the program is buggy , often crashes , or often freezes such that I need to kill it . I think many freeware programs work more smoothly than this junk .#### #### ####[([17], [19], 'NEG'), ([17], [24], 'NEG'), ([29], [40], 'NEG'), ([44], [19], 'NEG'), ([44], [46], 'NEG'), ([44], [49], 'NEG')]

You do n't create your character but play as an unnamed man with a past history that relates you to other characters in the game . The 3 Attributes are Strength , Dexterity , and Mana . Combat skills are 1-Handed Weapons , 2-Handed Weapons , Bows and Crossbows . Other skills include Alchemy , Forging , Lock Picking , etc . Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies and completing quests . When you reach the next level you get 10 \\" Learning Points \\" which can be used to boost attributes or skills . There are no defined classes . You can develop your character as a warrior , mage , etc . but ultimately you need to be fairly balanced. < br />< br /> I found combat hard . There are multiple keys to manipulate . Complicating the matter is that enemies are rarely alone . I usually had to use a \\" hit and run \\" approach . Tactics and spells / scrolls vary in effectiveness depending on the creature. < br />< br /> The world is big and varied and fun to explore . Generally the creatures do n't respawn but when a certain point in the game is reached . new enemies will show up . There is a nice variety of quests , many of which involve multiple steps . Often there is more than one way to accomplish something . e.g. I needed to get a key from a guard . I was given the option of bribing him or fighting him . ( and if I had had the pickpocket skill I assume I could have tried that )< br />< br /> I would highly recommend the game to any fan of rpg 's . It is long and varied . It gives a real sense of accomplishment as you advance your character . To those who played the original Gothic 2 , I would still recommend getting this expanded version . For me , it ran very smoothly compared to the original . The new material is not just added onto the end but is integrated into the game from the beginning . There are new characters , factions , creatures and spells . The dragons are much harder to defeat but there are scrolls that are effective against them .#### #### ####[([32], [131], 'POS'), ([32], [340], 'POS'), ([53], [91], 'POS'), ([94], [91], 'POS'), ([94], [340], 'POS'), ([130], [131], 'POS'), ([130], [340], 'POS'), ([130], [381], 'POS'), ([92], [340], 'POS')]

I have used the H & R Block program for more than 10 years so am familiar with it This year was my first year as disabled. < br />< br /> The program works . The directions as to how to submit your final return are easy to follow . This year I had to submit on paper and that became important to me . My return was accepted and my refund only took about a week longer . In regards to doing a general return , listing deductions for mortgages , business expenses , ongoing education , the new healthcare credit , charitable contributions ( especially figuring the value of used clothing and household items ) the program is great . The program will take you through an interview process for which customary situations the answers will end up putting the info in the right places on the form . It is simple to expand and look at the complete form and then go back to the interview . Moving about in the program is fairly easy with their menu. < br />< br /> For me , there were several negatives this year. < br /> First , I am disabled and not allowed to work . Apparently this makes me retired , but I wish the program had explained that to me . In fact , I have noticed over the past several years that the on-screen help has become less useful as it simply directs you to the IRS site . I am annoyed that you can no longer do searches and get answers to questions in text or their video lectures anymore . If I wanted to read the IRS website I would have done so. < br /> Second , it estimates my taxes for next year based on this year . I have private disability and SSDI and my income next year , as well as my deductions , will be quite different . The planning portion of this program is not very useful when there are major changes in your life . I will have to pay a live person to evaluate my return and advise me as to estimated tax payments. < br />< br /> Overall , I do feel the program is worth the cost , but I also believe it is not as good of a program as it used to be . iIn the past I have given this program 5 stars consistently . This year I can only give it an ok.y . This year I can only give it an ok .#### #### ####[([33], [47], 'NEU'), ([33], [121], 'NEU'), ([119], [47], 'NEU'), ([119], [121], 'NEU'), ([240, 241], [47], 'NEU'), ([240, 241], [178], 'NEU'), ([240, 241], [244, 245], 'NEU'), ([240, 241], [339, 340], 'NEU')]

VY2 is a very clear high quality voicebank . He has a massive range , and a Falsetto voicebank to extend that . He can be used for any genre of music . However he is n't perfect .

Sometimes the sound in front does n't play at all , so you have to make do without . Dashes can also bug out and make the pronunciation very strange . His Falsetto is not the best , at all .

I needed this version of Windows because the old security camera dvr card software was n't supposed to work with newer versions , and required 32-bit Windows XP or 32-bit Windows 7 . I held off activating this copy until I was sure the cards and DVR software worked with it . When it attempted to activate on its own , it failed and prompted me to call . I cancelled that dialog and later activated it online with no issues. < br />< br /> I 've since upgraded a copy to Windows 10 32-bit Insider Preview and the DVR software still works . I know it wo n't install , but it functions fine , and the upgrade to Windows 10 was flawless , even though it 's an ' unfinished ' preview version ( build 10130 ).< br />< br /> So , if you have software and / or hardware that is supported by this version , and are wondering about the free Windows 10 upgrade , it might be worth upgrading after saving the original installation . The particular software I 'm using does not work with 64-bit Windows 7 , and probably would n't with WIndows 10 64-bit . I saved a hard drive image of the Windows 7 installation just to be sure. < br />< br /> I ca n't guarantee that an upgrade to Windows 10 wo n't break your software , but it 's worth a try , particularly since it 's a free upgrade . Having said that , this is a very inexpensive way to upgrade a Windows XP computer to Windows 10 . I suspect the 32-bit version would be more compatible with older software and hardware. < br />< br /> Windows 10 upgrades to the same version of WIndows 7 or 8.x . The Pro version has features that one may or may not use , but my thoughts are it 's better to have it and not use it , than to not have it .#### #### ####[([184], [14, 15], 'POS'), ([184], [103], 'POS'), ([184], [189, 190], 'POS')]

This has been one of the best software companies until the last few years . Little by little they are going the way of Microsoft . The same for there Quicken product , both of which are made by intuit . The product still does what it is supposed to , however little by little they are making it harder to view details , control what you want . Forms are harder to get at .

I downloaded and installed a copy of this and used the free 3 day license to evaluate whether to buy or not. < br />< br /> It is easy to use , the controls are pretty obvious , and the setting of in and out points is both intuitive and helps greatly in reducing the time to analyse the video segment of interest . There are two buttons to permit doing vertical or horizontally split side by side comparisons and that seems to work in the preview window. < br />< br /> I then tried to save the stabilized video to disk , it went through the motions and produced a 634K MP4 file . That is either a fantastic bit of compression technology ( my selected segment , as a guess , was probably 250M out of the total 3.2G file from the GoPro ) or something is wrong . Unfortunately it is the later : the saved file wo n't play on either Windows or Linux . It is invalid . I tried this with two different video segments with similar results. < br />< br /> Next I tried uploading to YouTube . Again it went through the motions , asked me to login to YouTube , and gave me an error ( 101 ) that it could not < br /> communicate with the server . As a quick double check that it was indeed talking to YouTube I tried it again and entered both invalid and valid authentication data , getting the appropriate responses ( i.e. , failing to authenticate when I gave it bad codes and proceeding when I gave it good codes ).< br />< br /> From my experimentations I cannot see that this software is of any use .#### #### ####[([31], [29], 'NEG'), ([34], [37], 'NEG')]

As Adobe cleverly made it impossible to continue using all the older versions of Elements or CS series XP supported ....

I previously ran True Image 2010 - worked great with XP . When I later upgraded to Win 7 64 bit , I figured I 'd upgrade to TI2015 - what a collosal mistake. < br />< br /> First off the interface - it 's that Win 8-esque nonsense . Great at providing a very empty screen , lousy at providing any actual usable information. < br />< br /> Second - the jobs DON'T run to completion . This goofy software throws up an alert bubble in the status bar stating that I have to make a decision in 10 seconds or the job will be cancelled . Click on the alert bubble and it goes away but does n't take you to the Acronis software ! Start up the Acronis software , and it does n't give you an opportunity to make any choice , nor display any errors . Click &# 34 ; STOP &# 34 ; on the job , and it sits and spins ... Went through the nonsense of deleting , reconfiguring , etc. with the jobs - nothing works. < br />< br /> Third - Did I say that &# 34 ; STOP &# 34 ; is a joke ? Never works. < br />< br /> I wish I had a TARDIS so I could go back in time and stop myself from making the upgrade purchase ...< br />< br /> Again , avoid this software like the plague . Maybe some day they 'll come up with a cure , but if they 're sticking with that Win 8 interface , I seriously doubt it - just consider it an infestation , fumigate , rip out the corpse , dispose of it , and install some new fresh software from another company - something that works flawlessly .#### #### ####[([42], [8], 'NEG')]

A total piece of CRAP ! This software along with it 's customer support is a total piece of crap . After installing this on a couple of my PC 's , I noticed a big decrease in PC performance . After closing out several things , I finally narrowed it down to Kaspersky . I noticed it took 30-40 seconds before I could type in information in my browser ( like URL 's , google search parameters , login ID 's and passwords , etc ) . I finally decided it had to be the Kaspersky Virtual keyboard . In addition , trying to type bid prices in to eBay was also a problem which was attributed to Kaspersky Safe Money ( both key components of the Kaspersky Total Security Suite ) . I tried turning these off in my Firefox add-on options but they would turn themselves back on within minutes . I googled this and people suggested that I had to also turn it off in my Kaspersky Total Security manager interface and still , the damn thing kept turning itself on. < br />< br /> I wrote to Kaspersky support describing the problem in depth , and what I did and I immediately got a an auto reply . eventually , I got a reply from a real person asking me what the problem was . I told them to read my initial email because it described everything in depth and I would be happy to fill in any holes or questions they might have . The tech responded that he needed to know what error messages I was receiving . I told him , there were no error messages , error dialog boxes , etc . I simply turned off the add-ons and then looked again and saw they were reactivated . again , he asked me for error messages so I finally told him , &# 34 ; READ my previous emails ! there are no error messages &# 34 ; . he asked me to send him some screen captures and logs . He also asked me to install some other apps so they could capture additional info . I told him , I am not installing any more additional crap from your company . my problem is simple and I 've read that others have had the same complaint so this should not be new and you should already have a fix or standard reply to this problem . He asked me again for a screen capture and said he could not give me any more support if I ca n't provide a screen capture . I asked , what the hell am I suppose to capture ? my desktop ? there is NO INFORMATION in a screen capture that will help you resolve this problem . I told him , I want him to escalate this to another person that is willing to read my previous emails and understand that there is no further information I can provide that will be in a screen capture. < br />< br /> I 've been a happy user of Kaspersky for over 5 yrs till this latest release . It 's a total mess . It has slowed my PC in every aspect of performance to the point that I am going to have to rebuild my whole system just to get rid of this software . Customer support is completely frustrating and useless. < br />< br /> One last thing I learned about Kaspersky . when your 1 yr subscription expires , you no longer get updates but the entire suite stops working ! I can understand no more updates but for a security company to just leave you in the lurch without ANY protection seems like a company that is just interested in money and not your security . I promised this company that I would make sure everyone I knew would learn about my problems and issues with Kaspersky so this review is one step in keeping that promise .#### #### ####[([576], [579], 'NEG'), ([576], [611, 612], 'NEG')]

I used to like this product it seems to do what it is advertised to do . However , I have to say that their customer support is the worst of any I have encountered . I tried to log into my account to see how much time I had remaining on my subscription . but I got a user name / password error . So I decided to see what user name they thought I had and if necessary reset the password . I tried four times to retrieve my user name but after a week of trying nothing but dead air . I tried to have them rest my password same story more dead air . Right now I just going to let my subscription lapse and look . I have looked at review sites and see they give this product rave reviews , however this is not supported by Amazon users . The only way to contact their support ( if they really such a thing ) is phone , to get them through the internet you have to log on to your account which is whay I was contacting them in the first place .

It will show measurement , but not the ingredient . Therefore , I have to still pull out my printed recipes . Plus , I was hoping to print all my recipes and create cookbooks for my family . Well guess what , that has issues too ! When I print the recipes , instead of a &# 34 ; fraction &# 34 ; ( 1 / 4 ) measurement , it shows a &# 34 ;?&# 34 ; for some of the recipes .

This software works fine . You can used it to upgrade past versions of installed windows . It is for UK English , but you can change it to US English later in the installation . I personally thought it was interesting how some things are phrased differently . The main reason I bought 8.1 pro verses plain 8.1 . Is so I could upgrade to the windows media center for only 10 dollars . So if you think you may want that particular App in the future . You want the pro version . Also Windows Media Center App will not be available in windows 10 .

There is a lot to like about this software , but there are significant disappointments as well . Creating a floor plan is fairly straightforward and the software is reasonably capable . Some things are a challenge , like which direction a pocket door slides , however . And there are some major limitations in this version , including fixture selections , fireplace layout , roof types and slopes , and especially an open beam ceiling . To match up to reality , you would need the expensive ($ 500 ) version unless you had plain vanilla everything -- and therein lies my biggest disappointment . For all of the capabilities shown on the website , what is not revealed is that you need the expensive model to do most of the things shown . The ability to look through a 3-D version of what you created is very cool ; however , the inability to create what I wanted ( because of version limitations ) prevented me from making my intended use of the software and seeing my proposed changes -- And for not much more than $ 500 ( for the capable version ) I can pay someone else to do what I want and save the time and effort .

Just what I needed to reinstall Windows on my replacement hard drive. < br />< br /> After my computer drive died , I fortunately was using a cloud back-up , but of course you ca n't back up the original software and restore it that way . I had recorded my Microsoft Windows 8 Licence number , but my machine came with no disk . Not a problem if you need to reinstall on a working hard drive , but with a new drive , you need something to boot it from , and I had no boot disk . This booted the machine from the DVD drive , and started a reinstall of Windows 8 , asking for the licence along the way . When the licence was put it , it continued until the system was up and running , and then I was able to update to the 8.1 version of Windows that I was running. < br />< br /> You must have a valid licence key to install Windows 8 from his disk , and if you do , then it will solve the problem of no manufacturers original disk to boot from .#### #### ####[([98, 99], [97], 'POS')]

I 'd like to give this product a 5 star rating , but the learning curve is very steep . In fact , if I did n't actually need it so badly , I would have given up on it . There are so many features and variables spread over so many non-intuitive tabs , drop-downs and tool bars that it 's nearly impossible to remember what 's where . This is especially true of commands and features you do n't often use . There are also some things that are impossible to do and you have to add notes or rests manually after the score has been printed - kind of not what you 'd expect from an application of this calibre .

Let me tell you the reason this OS has so many haters and so many people who love it. < br />< br /> The reason people hate it is the UI . People do n't like it and ca n't get used to it . Fair enough , I understand. < br />< br /> The reason people love it is if you get used to the new ' metro ' UI , ( which I believe you CAN disable ) Windows 8.1 runs beautifully . In my opinion , it is way better than Vista , but also an improvement on Windows 7 , which a lot of people love. < br />< br /> I do n't use the built-in store or bing ( I disabled both of these ) and the desktop runs really well. < br />< br /> There is very little delay when connecting to a monitor , which is better than Win 7 and having to wait a few seconds. < br />< br /> Wired Xbox 360 controllers work natively , but this may not matter if you either use a mouse and keyboard or already went through the effort to set up a controller with Win 7. < br />< br /> The one-button search has been improved drastically . Basically , you can think of what you want to do , and press the Windows key to search for it . This could be something like ' Add user ' or ' remove program ' or ' network settings ' . It is really good at bringing you where you want to be , which makes the UI much easier to get used to . I think Win 7 had this as well , but in Win 8.1 the search is more responsive and &# 34 ; smooth &# 34 ;.< br />< br /> I 'm a big fan of Win 8.1 . However I find that people without a touchscreen laptop are way more likely to hate it . People with a touchscreen usually love using it . Keep this in mind if you are looking to upgrade .#### #### ####[([31], [27], 'POS'), ([31], [280], 'POS'), ([31], [303], 'POS')]

This is a total fail . What I got was a disk with windows 7 on it that was not an official copy and a used COA sticker that had been scraped off of a computer and stuck on a piece of plastic and shipped with the disk . It would not activate out of the &# 34 ; Box &# 34 ; obviously but I was able to get it to after a call to Microsoft . If I had n't been under pressure to get a computer up and running I would have sent this back . It is not legitimate . I can only hope that the vendor selling these gets a visit from Microsoft in the near future . Update : I have corresponded with the vendor over my negative review of them and he was very unhappy with the negative review which I defended to him . He seems certain that he is getting new copies of windows 7 pro oem software and that is what I should have received . With no urging or even asking for it he refunded the purchase price and said not to return the product . his actions speak well for him . If true he has a vendor issue but is n't trying to defraud anyone .#### #### ####[([27], [25], 'NEG'), ([13, 14], [4], 'NEG'), ([162, 163], [4], 'NEG')]

Remarkably good for the money . I had my main video editor , a pro tool , fail completely . It should n't have happened but had to wait for their support center to open during the business week . I had to use Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 18 while I waited . I was surprised . It 's actually quite good for the most part with an occasional bug here and there . But the software works , did n't crash and rendered videos quickly . It is pretty intuitive although I suggest you watch a video before you begin , many available on YouTube . The rendering was very quick and took advantage of my CPU . The number of FX for your videos is staggering . You can create monster videos with a real professional touch with this package and it 's crazy when you think about how little the price is for such power. < br />< br /> There are some things that are n't perfect . I think rearranging could do better . I would like better snapping to timeline points or make it default . But there were so many smart things about the app that I liked , I have to give it credit where it 's due . Runs perfectly on my i7-3770 .

The free trial on their website actually allows you to read , and study though the first 10 CHAPTERS with progress saving FOR FREE !< br /> and once you decide to buy you can just enter your code , and pick up where you left off !< br /> That 's way more then enough to get you started. < br /> This software is available on pc , ios , and android , so you can study anywhere ( mobile versions sold separately )< br /> It is written very well , and feels more like a having a person explain the topic rater then the writing style of a text book. < br /> and they do a great job of explaining the little things. < br />< br /> The only real downside is for learning katakana and hiragana , they do n't really have a great way to help you memorize what you learned ,< br /> sure you can go back and read the sections , but the only place you can see multiple sets of letters at once is in the ' memory matching game '< br /> where you 'll spend half the time looking for the second part of a pair , and much less memorizing what you 've learned. < br />< br /> an easy fix to this , is just to use an online site like hiraganaquiz . com ,< br /> that 's more a ' flash card ' style page , and makes memorizing much faster ,< br />< br /> but overall this is a great program for getting you started learning ,< br /> I 'm not done with it yet , but so far it 's been well worth the money !< br />< br /> If you 're not sure about it , or what to know if it will work on computer or tablet or phone ,< br /> just download the ' lite ' version , they have links to all the free trails on their website !#### #### ####[([189, 190], [259], 'POS'), ([90], [92], 'POS')]

Win 8 or 8.1 is worse than Windows Me . Avoid the crap . Microsoft is returning the start menu after we told them where to stick their useless metro user interface which they were trying to force me and you to use despite that a third grader would have designed something better . The worst every decision I have seen from Microsoft since I started using computers a long time ago was to release Windows 8 with no start menu . The metro interface had absolutely nothing that you could use for production and the so-called apps had no way to close them . It is just terrible , so it is . However , if you install a third party start menu , it turned out the OS was very good just terrible decision making from Microsoft , a real baulmer !#### #### ####[([0, 1], [5], 'NEG'), ([0, 1], [108], 'NEG'), ([0, 1], [134], 'NEG'), ([29, 30], [28], 'NEG'), ([29, 30], [87], 'NEG'), ([29, 30], [108], 'NEG')]

Over the years I have tried several recipe programs , but they always came up short with ease of use and support , in fact I think they went out of business . There was a chance to buy an earlier version of this program for a great price and after reading a LOT of reviews on Amazon , I decided to try one more recipe program and am I glad I did . It was a great program that only seems to keep getting better with free upgrades and then after a year of two they have a full upgrade that does cost more money . I was very happy with version 10 , but then a few problems cropped up and I contacted customer service . They not only got back to me with answers , it was done within 24 hours . Very consise and easy to follow . When they offered the free upgrade to using their cloud and syncing to my iPad and iPhone I jumped on it . The computer I use for all on the recipes is at my office so I would need to print any recipes I wanted to cook at home , but I could not get it to work so back to customer service . We tried several ways to get it to work , but to no avail . At this point they said they were aware of some problems and they were working on it , but if it would make me happy they would offer the upgrade to the newest version for a special price . I thought their offer was more than fair and I jumped on it that day . Unfortunely , it did not work either and I contacted customer service again , they replied in a few hours with a few more questions which I answered and in another hour they send a VERY detailed message that again was easy to follow and now it works great . I could not be more pleased with this product and how my problems were quickly solved in a professional manner .

On my PC for professional Photos I use Corel Paintshop for speed and good effects in the field , and for studio quality I still use Adobe CS4 , Corel Paintshop and or other professional Software . I do n't want the Web for it 's not always available to me or it is at such a slow speed I 'd never get done . I finally decided to move completely over to MAC for my video and photo endeavors . However MAC does n't seem to have any really good / outstanding photo software since Aperture ( which was ok ) no longer works and &# 34 ; Photos for OS X &# 34 ; is in its infancy there 's only Adobe and again I do n't want to depend on the Internet and sometimes for making a profit the less I have to edit the better . I 've only had PhotoDirector for a week and been working mainly on videos , so this opinion my not be totally fair . I 'll be working on a pro-bono banner design photo project sometime before Aug. So , by then I may have a better understanding of PhotoDirector . I 'm still looking for a professional photo software for MAC and I may have to end up with Adobe ( do n't get me wrong Adobe is a great product ) just for my reasons : efficiency , need for internet and cost wise I hesitate to get Adobe at this time .#### #### ####[([20], [13], 'NEU'), ([20], [83], 'NEU')]

There are a couple of circumstances in which Dragon dictate works like a charm . For informal emails and short notes that do n't require a lot of editing , the program is perfectly adequate . Unfortunately , when it comes to editing and proofreading longer documents , Dragon is practically useless . When using voice commands to select , revise , or insert text , it almost always moves the cursor to the wrong place in the document . This can result in mistakes like deleting the wrong word or inserting a sentence in the middle of a previously typed word . The only time when editing commands do work correctly is when they are used on text that was dictated moments earlier. < br />< br /> I think I know the reason for this . From what I can tell , Dragon does n't actually read the text of the document . When trying to find a specific place in the text , the most Dragon can do is remember previous dictation commands . This means that if you try to use the mouse and keyboard together with dictation , Dragon will lose its ability to navigate the document accurately.it also means that Dragon is completely hopeless when it comes to editing documents that were typed by someone else. < br />< br /> I 've tried to find solutions to these issues on the support forums , and found a post by a staff member stating that these problems were due to &# 34 ; the limitations of OS X &# 34 ; , implying that they 're not going to be resolved anytime soon. < br />< br /> It 's sad that there 's no viable alternative on the market , as Nuance is essentially selling a nonfunctional product . If you can , avoid spending money on this program .#### #### ####[([31], [34], 'NEG'), ([31], [51], 'NEG'), ([48], [51], 'NEG')]

You would be better served with nothing than this , it does little to protect your computer but constantly promotes itself .

Horrible experience with this so far . My bank ( which I will not mention but is one of the big five ) does not work with quicken unless you pay them a monthly fee .

this review rating is a cross between a One / Two Star for Installation Ease and a Four Star for Functionality ... What a quagmire for installing this software , especially on additional devices , since this is intended for &# 34 ;&# 34 ; unlimited &# 34 ;&# 34 ; devices . My desktop was first which was mediocre install . Next was laptop , which was considerably harder since I had installed on Desktop first , it took some finagling to the license to understand i was the same user installing it on an additional device . The biggest pain was trying to put on my Android cell phone .... . ha ha ha ha .... . the app appears but I can not be sure that it is functioning correctly . Besides the fact of asking for a slew ( 5 ) of additional &# 34 ;&# 34 ; Security &# 34 ;&# 34 ; questions just for the cell phone .... . It tends to also a battery hog on a barely year-old Galaxy S4 . so something is running in the app , but I cannot view any functions because of asking for all of the &# 34 ;&# 34 ; Security &# 34 ;&# 34 ; questions each i open the app . UPDATE : July 22 after using for approx 2 months i have Uninstalled this &# 34 ;&# 34 ; LiveSafe &# 34 ; a few days ago just to see if &# 34 ; it ' was the culprit ..... and YUP ... . gee it completely slowed my computer ( s ) down . I am thinking that it analyzed every mouse click so much that it prevented anything to be done . Many many times it prevented Firefox from opening websites ... as common as Amazon , Google News etc . Sometime so bad I needed to do a reboot to even close the browser window . Even had to resort to the On / Off switch when i had no cursor or keyboard control . Maybe there are settings somewhere that would prevent this but sorting through McAfee minutiae to find was unsuccessful . And it 's not that i am computer illiterate but how frustrating to try use something you buy and it totally does opposite to your computer#### #### ####[([20], [24], 'NEG'), ([20], [190], 'NEG'), ([20], [297], 'NEG'), ([120], [24], 'NEG'), ([120], [297], 'NEG'), ([186], [24], 'NEG'), ([193], [190], 'NEG'), ([193], [297], 'NEG')]

I really wanted Kaito V3 because I have no other male singer libraries . He comes with three discs . Two of them contain his voice banks JPN Straight , JPN Soft , JPN Whisper , and finally English . One is for windows installation and the other is Mac . The Final Disc is the Studio 2 Artist Piapro Edition . Piapro Studio and the Mutant Vst Plugin are on the Kaito Disc . You must first install Studio 2 first to get Piapro to work but what 's better is just having the VOCALOID 3 or 4 editor . He can be used by beginners but , I 'm an intermediate user of vocaloid . Kaito 's Straight voicebank is a struggle to edit . It was suppose to replicate his original V1 voice . Soft and Whisper are very easy to edit and are Fine . His English VB is understandable and slightly smooth but , he still has the Japanese accent so he wo n't sound like a native speaker . The VB is good when working with his straight voicebank . But Kaito 's English VB is not suggested by me to compose Rock songs . Over all , I think this purchase was a great deal .#### #### ####[([62, 63], [142], 'POS'), ([62, 63], [123], 'POS'), ([119, 120], [123], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [142], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [156], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [90], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [153], 'POS')]

The best windows is 95 2nd best windows 98 its basic , it dose not have too much not needed bells . it did not take up a hole lot of hard drive space . I did not have to worry about Virus , Malware , adware and so on . No product activation nightmare to call in. yes there is a serial number to type in that is a nightmare to type in . Windows 95 did have one draw back . before you can install windows 95 you got to be a rocket designer to understand the questions and answer it. that pre set up installer . I will still rather use windows 95 or windows 98 I did not have to prove to any one at Microsoft to ask them If I can use it. give away my I.D The so called Windows XP that every one wanted to keep . Its a nightmare to install . Microsoft got rude on the phone. and starting doing virus , ad ware , spyware , malware , root kit locking peoples computer . enforce you to pay a thousand dollars to unlock it to buy a new serial number . I did not talk about MICROSOFT selling dead O.S . Windows 3.11 , Windows ME , windows vista , Windows 8 windows 8.1 turn on the computer boot up windows , open a folder then blue screen of death . then dose not turn on. motherboard shorted out. < br /> Windows 8 and windows 8.1 it done a blue screen of death every time I try to open a folder . its worse then vista. < br /> it created 50 hard drive partitions with nothing inside . I used a 1T hard drive . I had no space left to install one game . it gets even worse . nothing worked. < br /> So I have to go windows 7 64 bit ultimate and or pro. < br /> I have video games that do not work . like GTA V PC spyware jail lock . using mods is boot legging . The launcher killed the game . pay the dealer 70.00 plus sales tax got GTA V PC only to break the computer . It was never like this on windows 95 and windows 98 No one used spyware to break peoples computer . it was done different they had games that did not work . did not have to spend $ 60.00 on a dead game. < br /> The worst you might think enough all ready . How Microsoft dose break peoples computer for more money or else kill it . Windows 10 is going to be far worse then ME,XP , Vista , 7 , 8 , 8.1 Microsoft says you can get Windows 10 for free . oh I need a hole in my head . NOTHING IS FREE ! first the say Free for the launch date / its first year on the market . they changed there mind . now MICOSOFT says you have to wait for the final windows 10 to come out to get it free . have to wait for Windows 10 version A , B , C , D , E what ever the final version . OK . then the I.D theft . selling me spam freeze my windows buy stuff from Microsoft to unlock my windows . jail lock my windows force me to spend a thousand dollars to unlock it. the pay more money to Microsoft to buy a fake virus killer . I made my mind not to get in to windows 10. < br /> Lets get rid of Microsoft . get a new brand name . buy a basic O.S and use the CPU as the direct X and the price $ 20.00 all that stupid virus , spyware , serial numbers , I.D theft malware , jail lock . everything like that gone. < br /> get a small business making a small basic O.S for 20.00 or free . no serial number , no product activation , no jail lock on games. and the CPU is the direct X .#### #### ####[([246], [247], 'NEG'), ([405], [247], 'NEG')]

It is always a good idea to do regular backups of your computer . In my case , my backups have saved me several times . Hard drives fail . The manufacturer may replace your hard drive , but they cannot replace your information .

True Image Backup will restore your files to a new hard drive .

This program helps you author DVDs , convert videos to different formats , and capture still images and snippets from VHS tapes or DVDs . It worked fine for a while , but then bugs started turning up . Unfortunately , the free support only lasts a couple of weeks . Then , you are thrown on the tender mercies of the user forum . A review here on Amazon suggested that installing a previous version ( we have two older versions of this program ) might work . That did the trick .

Let 's get this out there : I am hardly a PaintShop Pro X6 expert . However this program is very user friendly and even if you are just using it , as I am , to modify and clean up scans of old photos and enhance downloaded personal digital images you will be able to work wonders with this application . For instance I recently discovered several boxes of 35mm slides and negatives from the 60 and 70s that I have been able to scan to my PC for archiving purposes . As you might imagine these old slides and negatives are faded and have blemishes , dirt , and other imperfections . I have been able to use PaintShop Pro X6 to correct the color , adjust balance and contrast , adjust for fading , sharpen ( or soften ) the image , and also &# 34 ; remove &# 34 ; visual imperfections from these old images to bring them to life again . Sometimes all it takes is a simple and quick click on the &# 34 ; auto-fix &# 34 ; function , at others it will take a bit more effort to clean and &# 34 ; restore &# 34 ; these images but it is usually a matter of minutes and it is well worth the time and effort if you enjoy working with old family photos , slides , and / or negatives . PaintShop Pro X6 also has a whole menu of &# 34 ; effects &# 34 ; options to change the appearance of your digital images including numerous &# 34 ; one-click &# 34 ; options to give your photo the look of previous eras for a nostalgic look . Therse are also numerous &# 34 ; one-click &# 34 ; options for changing the lighting of you image or even the &# 34 ; media &# 34 ; : you can make your picture look like an oil painting , a water-color , pencil sketch , or stained-glass window . Just to name a few of the options available . Again , I am utlizing a small fraction of PaintShop Pro X6 's functionality and I may , when time permits , dig a bit deeper . But in the meanwhile I have found this the prorgam to be much more than adequate for my purposes and I can highly recommend it even for someone who is not very technical with computers .#### #### ####[([18], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([18], [394], 'POS'), ([120, 121], [394], 'POS'), ([126], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([131], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([131], [394], 'POS')]

I had been putting off shooting RAW images because of my inexperience with photo editing software so I read up & came away with what I determined were the two most popular applications : Adobe Lightroom / Elements and Corel Paintshop Pro X7 . I found through many written and video reviews that Corel was a powerful software package for half the price of Adobe Photoshop Elements . You can edit images very simply by using the &# 34 ; suggested settings &# 34 ; and tweak them further if you wish . There is also a very advanced photo editing interface ( Raw Laboratory ) for more extensive editing . Shooting in RAW is now another tool that has been unlocked thanks to Corel 's easy to use interface . There are many advanced features which I will learn as time goes on , but as of now I have learned how to edit the RAW image , save it as a . tiff file and convert it to a jpeg for web posting & emails . This program can take your photography to the next level if you have been hesitating . Your photos will look great and you will have a powerful photo editing software tool that you can grow with . By the way , you can also edit your jpegs but they are a &# 34 ; lossy &# 34 ; file type and lose quality each time they are manipulated .#### #### ####[([58], [56], 'POS'), ([58], [204], 'POS'), ([58], [126], 'POS'), ([39, 40], [98], 'POS'), ([57, 58], [56], 'POS'), ([57, 58], [126], 'POS'), ([99, 100], [98], 'POS'), ([129], [56], 'POS'), ([129], [126], 'POS'), ([205, 206], [204], 'POS')]
As a Photoshop Elements 6 user I am very disappointed . I volunteer with a nonprofit and used Elements 6 to create PSA posters and announcements for Facebook . I lost Elements 6 when my last PC crashed . I got Elements 13 and tried to install it yesterday . After more than 5 hours later and working with their support , the program installed - or so I thought . Today I click on the icon and nothing happens . All I wanted was to be able to clone , do edits and add text and here I sit . I am frustrated and angry times ten . I understand a corporation wanting to make money but when you pay and get nothing , that is worse than wrong , that is criminal . If anything changes I will be happy to edit this review but for now , this is it . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As promised , I am adding an update to my review if we were able to get the Photoshop Elements 13 . After two days and a combined effort from Adobe Support and myself got the program working . If it were not for the ability to print out the Amazon 's purchase order / receipt , I doubt if I would be as happy . The product requires a 24-digit key to open the program and there was no such code in my product which led me to wonder about this seller 's source . End of story ... Photoshop Elements 13 works perfectly . It does everything I wanted and more . As a Photoshop Elements 6 user , I love several changes made in the new version .

I agree with many of the commenters on this . QB for Mac does n't compare to the PC version . I converted my company file from PC to Mac , and now , I cannot set up a budget ( I was told the &# 34 ; links &# 34 ; to the data was broken ) . I have spent over 6 hours over 3 weeks with the Intuit QB for Mac support , but nothing has been fixed and I cannot create a budget for the next fiscal year . This is by far the worst experience I 've had with mac software. < br />< br /> They have tried to &# 34 ; recover data ,&# 34 ; but when I got the fixed file back , nothing changed and the budget that I entered is not reflected correctly in the report . They had me on the computer with them for hours , which took away from my work . I have worked with three different support technicians , and none of them have been able to find a solution .#### #### ####[([10], [13, 14], 'NEG'), ([10], [98], 'NEG'), ([39], [141, 142], 'NEG'), ([71], [13, 14], 'NEG'), ([71], [98], 'NEG')]
YAY !!!... . Er ... I mean ... It 's like this ... I build all my own computers and have done it for years . ( No , I do n't build laptops ... but I do n't consider them to be real computers . Feel free to disagree with my view and I 'll feel free to ignore you . j / k. . . sorta ) As a self system builder , I do n't think I should have to pay &# 34 ; full freight &# 34 ; for an OS . ESPECIALLY when I could USE Windows 7 without a legit key and sacrifice not having Windows Defender for an antivirus solution . On the other hand , I like Windows Defender . So , paying for Windows does n't bother me . Paying TOO MUCH bugs the DICKENS outta me ! ( On an irrelevant side note , why is &# 34 ; Dickens &# 34 ; a suitable alternate for your favorite curse word and why does the guy who wrote &# 34 ; A Christmas Carol &# 34 ; get his name used this way ?)< br />< br /> So , I bought the disk . I 'm not sure why it had to be mailed to me when a download would have been cheaper and faster . But , the price was right ... way right ! It was delivered on time and came in an eco-friendly box . It has the key right on the box . I loaded it . It made lots of noise in the drive and took for what seemed to be an eternity . Of course , that was normal because I was using a CD . Using a thumb drive with a bootable image goes way faster . But , I had a D / A attack and did n't notice that the BIOS was n't seeing the hard drive properly . ( Fellow geeks , be kind . I 'd used Gigabyte boards for my last 2 builds . The Asus BIOS was a lil ' different. )< br />< br /> In reality , the only thing I needed , ( and for that matter , the only thing anyone needs ,) was the whole CD for was so I could get a key. < br /> Using a thumb drive for installs is SO much faster than using a cd for an install . And , if you download WIndows from a legit site online you get the latest release . That means less updating after you 're done. < br />< br /> So , all in all , I say it 's a great buy . I got Windows 7 for a good price It works and at the time of this writing it 's the best O / S Microsoft ever made . Get yourself one .#### #### ####[([230], [464], 'POS'), ([295, 296], [303], 'POS'), ([295, 296], [405], 'POS'), ([398, 399], [303], 'POS'), ([398, 399], [405], 'POS'), ([460, 461], [303], 'POS'), ([460, 461], [405], 'POS'), ([465], [464], 'POS')]

I was able to install this on a Windows 8.1 machine . The first thing I had to do was disable my Kaspersky anti-virus protection , after cutting power to the router box to be sure the machine was safely offline during the operation. < br />< br /> The second thing I had to do was be rather patient . The disk still spins and appears to be doing nothing , but if you pull up task manager , and scroll down to the bottom of the processes list to view Windows installer 32 bit , you can see that it is in fact doing something . Took around 25 minutes for the installer to actually begin copying new files , but it all went without a hitch after that . All the games started up , and I was able to get into actual game play . Playing ' The Haunting of Castle Malloy ' at the moment. < br />< br /> The disk will prompt you to install Direct X before you see the installer . I wasnt sure I had it , so I let it do that before I disabled anti-virus since that requires an internet connection to download . Afterwards , or if you already have it , just let it start then hit cancel , since it does n't really give you the option of declining . The installer will then appear. < br />< br /> After you are done be sure to re-enable your anti-virus protection before you re-connect to the internet. < br />< br /> I also was able to install this on an old Windows 7 laptop that 's been offline and un-updated for at least a year. < br />< br /> The developer , Her Interactive , also appears to offer considerable customer support . They just dont post the individual solutions online , you have to contact them , but I wanted to try on my own first. < br />< br /> Hope this helps .#### #### ####[([22, 23], [20], 'POS'), ([62], [306], 'POS'), ([23], [20], 'POS'), ([23], [195], 'POS'), ([23], [252], 'POS')]

I mainly use this tool to perform searches and generate reports from other sources ( ie. Ancestry.com ) . The reports ( family trees ) consistently place children in the wrong chronological order , and spouses out of order ( wife 2 before wife1 ) . The individual 's birth dates are shown correctly , but the tool apparently does n't use the date to sort the information . The reports are really quite useless as a result . Sad considering date sorting is one of the most basic of software functions . How that slipped past testing is really beyond me ( the dates being compared are a consistent format ) . From the blogs I 've read they refuse to provide a software update fix , instead you must purchase the next version . Have n't read if the new version actually fixed the bug. < br />< br /> It does have some nice features , such of showing missing data or signalling possible errors within an individual 's data . Anyone using Ancestry.com knows there are no good search tools there , so you must use a tool such as RootsMagic to perform searches : for instance if you want to find all people in your tree born in a particular town or who are buried in a particular location . This tool can be used for that , and with some reading and practice you can create a nice report of such searches .#### #### ####[([57], [74], 'NEU'), ([157], [74], 'NEU'), ([157], [156], 'NEU'), ([194], [74], 'NEU'), ([194], [156], 'NEU')]

Background :< br /> I have Windows 8.1 on 2 devices - An Asus tablet , and a Lenovo &# 34 ; convertible &# 34 ;.< br />< br /> As a desktop OS , it 's not bad . There is a learning curve , there are some annoying &# 34 ; features &# 34 ; microsoft wants to force down your throat , but if you spend the time learning it as you do complaining , you 'll get it 's nuances. < br />< br /> On the convertible , I use typical desktop applications ( Office , Photoshop , MythTV , some Unix connection programs , Cygwin etc - pretty eclectic set ) everything runs fine . The tablet has full Windows ( Not RT , 32 bit ) I run a few desktop apps on it . They run fine as well. < br />< br /> I also run a few &# 34 ; apps &# 34 ; on both . As of about a month ago , the Windows Store stopped allowing apps to be downloaded .

I cannot .

Two stars , only because it DID work , for about 6-12 hours from when I installed it . I was able to mess with the voices , and create my ' alias '.< br />< br /> However , when I attempted to open the program a second time to test it out with someone on Skype now that they were home , it would not load , and all I get is a ' MorphVOX Pro has stopped working ' error. < br />< br /> I went to the MorphVOX website -- their support section is a JOKE , btw - and emailed tech support . They blamed my computer and sent me a link to download FinallyFast to scan my system ( which cost me another $ 19.95 , btw )< br />< br /> Oh , but to actually USE FinallyFast ( AFTER already paying for it ) you have to CALL for it to be activated . At which point , their people want remote access to your computer , and start talking about how you probably have trojan viruses , etc and they spend the next 30 minutes trying to force you to accept their phone tech support to remove these imaginary viruses -- to the tune of 3 payments of $ 120 each. < br />< br /> Then , when you 've FINALLY convinced them that no , you 're not paying anyone that kind of money for something you can do YOURSELF for free ( since you work in tech support ) , they finally quit trying to hijack your computer or force you to talk to their technician , you run the utility ( after backing EVERYTHING up to an external hard drive , cuz these people are seriously suspicious ) , fix the couple of minor registry errors and . NET framework issues it found , and ...< br />< br /> The program STILL will not work after having uninstalled and reinstalled it. < br />< br /> For $ 40 , I 'm seriously unimpressed .#### #### ####[([76, 77], [79, 80], 'NEG'), ([76, 77], [309], 'NEG'), ([76, 77], [328, 329], 'NEG')]

Fantastic software - the best mind mapping software in existance , integrated into MS Office products . I use this software as often as any otehr except Outlook ( which I dislike , but it holds my contacts , my calendar , and my email so I use it frequently ).< br />< br /> But Mindjet has a bad habit of releasing new editions and charging for the upgrades . I hate the frequency with which they do it and the fact that they create new tools that only work with the newest release . If you want to upgrade , this version has almost nothing that previous versions lacked. and , of course by now it is obsolete. < br /> 4 stars would be 5 if I were just rating the software and the mindmapping it does wonderfully well . 4 stars would be 2 if I only thought about obsolescence . I gave it 4 / 5 because the quality of the software is more important to me than the fact that it becomes obsolete so frequently .

Why ca n't commercial general purpose operating systems today be as simple and reliable as Win98 ? I purchased an IBM ThinkPad T20 awhile ago with the intention to use it for managing my small collection of telecommunications equipment . Unfortunately , this laptop had XP installed along with a bunch of other software that was slowing the system down quite significantly . After nuking the T20 's hard drive , I installed 98 SE with not a single problem during the installation . Now , after about two years of faithful service , I have not run into any problems with this OS . In fact , this is the only Windows computer I own , having replaced Windows 7 , 8 , and server 2008 on my other machines with various Linux distros because of the plethora of problems I ran into with those versions of Windows . Today I use my 98 SE machine not only for network administration , but also for various engineering projects in college and at home . If I ever come to possess any more computers from the late 90s or early 2000s , then I will probably look to use Windows 98 on those machines as well .#### #### ####[([15], [11], 'POS'), ([15], [13], 'POS'), ([15], [56], 'POS'), ([15], [140], 'POS'), ([58], [13], 'POS'), ([58], [56], 'POS'), ([68, 69], [140], 'POS'), ([73, 74], [140], 'POS'), ([103], [11], 'POS'), ([103], [13], 'POS'), ([103], [56], 'POS'), ([103], [140], 'POS')]
It eventually worked but i had to trouble shoot online after calling and support was no help . WARNING ... i think this is intentional as they want you to call to get help and then they do a run of your system remotely and then tell you need your computer &# 34 ; serviced &# 34 ; to remove old files and fix registry errors and to search for viruses ..... and they will do it for a FEE of $ 180 in 15 mintutes ... I think this unnecessary upsell is how they make money . A real scam . The ' registry fix ' is a red flag and is pointless. < br />< br /> I eventually got it working as the software didnt work to network the computer and you have to set the IPs on the machines in ipv4 to their own ips so the machines can communicate . If you dont know how to do this or realize they are trying to scam you into getting the useless $ 180 ' cleaning ' ( you can download ccleaner for free and it will do exactly what they will charge you to do IF you needed to but you most likely DONT ) you will spend money on a useless service and as I said before once they start the pitch it becomes pretty obvious this is their intended MO . My first hint was support answered right away ! lol only sales departments are that well manned . lol < br />< br /> I gave it 2 stars because after I fixed it ( support didnt know how to set up the networking which was why i called ) it DID work . It said it would take 121 hours to complete but it finished in about 12 and for the most part everything transferred great and it worked as intended . If it had worked correctly to network or even worked after the support call I would give it 4 stars but since they just want you to call to scam you out of $ 180 to do a useless cleaning that a piece of free software does better I gave it 2 stars . If you are not computer savvy you probably wont figure out how to use this software .#### #### ####[([13], [15, 16], 'NEG'), ([13], [127, 128], 'NEG'), ([126], [15, 16], 'NEG'), ([126], [127, 128], 'NEG')]

I 've been using Corel Suite for decades . I do n't really see that many enhancements over say , circa 1999 . There are a few , like bisecting lines , that are quite helpful . Overall , it works pretty much like it always worked only now it 's 64 Bit . One thing I do n't like is the dependency on buying a subscription and constant WEB dependency . I think this software costs enough as is , do we really need to pay for an annual subscription to download things that should have been included with the original license we purchased ? The &# 34 ; Fills ,&# 34 ; function barely works and will crash the program in Corel Draw , it constantly relies on web connection and interface . Previously you were issued a separate disc with these on it . The subscription comes with tech support ... I had a tech issue initially that went into the abyss & was n't responded to , I suppose if I 'd bought the subscription ? Seems like extortion ... I later figured out a work-around . Bottom line , I did n't want to have to learn a new software suite so I bought it . There are some serious competitors in the graphics software space with good capabilities .

I do n't usually rate things this low , partly because I tend to research items before I buy them . Being a slightly older version , this was on deep discount , so I took a chance since my needs were pretty simple ( burning DVDs of family video clips ) . But I thought I should warn potential buyers that there is a very high likelihood that this product will not work with laptops that are even a couple of years old , even if they meet the system requirements on the box . I have a Dell Inspirion 15z from late 2012 / early 2013 and the program simply will not run . Period . Nothing seemed to help , hardware settings , driver updates , nothing . Some ' updates' actually made it worse . I am not a software expert , but I am not a tech newbie , either . Perhaps there is something I have not tried , but it really should not be this hard to burn a DVD from home movies . Seeing as how most people looking in this price range are probably not experts , either , I cannot recommend this product , unless you are in the market for a $ 40 coaster .#### #### ####[([110], [113], 'NEG'), ([110], [199, 200], 'NEG')]

A great project for summer for the kids . Teaches typing skills via games . My kids did this for four summers and are great typists now . What they learned in school was too minimal . This makes learning fun , especially the game Typer Shark , which in my opinion is a must for any adult learning to type . Also it helps with improving speed once you have the basic typing skills mastered !

I 've been using this program for years and it makes the writing process totally easy . It has crashed once or twice but I have never lost any info do to their amazing auto save feature . For screenwriting I have almost no complaints . My only wish was that I had more control over using multiple columns . It has a duel dialogue feature which is nice but I have to figure out how to have one column of dialogue and the action in a column next to it or three characters talking at once as is sometime the case in stage play format . Which brings me to the reason 4 instead of 5 stars . It 's a better program for screenplays then stage plays. that being said it is still easier then any other program I 've tried . I use a 5 year old Mac and have no issues with the speed of the program or spell check . As a writer I can be in creative flow and never have to think about the formatting because final draft takes care of it totally reliably . Lastly their customer service is the best I 've ever experienced .#### #### ####[([34, 35], [68], 'POS'), ([34, 35], [33], 'POS'), ([34, 35], [153, 154], 'POS'), ([34, 35], [198], 'POS')]

I bought this program because I had very poor reading comprehension , along with a slow reading speed , and I can already notice great improvement in both. < br />< br /> In course mode , which is the mode I use , it measures your speed and comprehension by answering questions to a passage , and from there , most of the lessons are either exercises that improve your eye movement , or games with simple rules. < br />< br /> In other words , it really improves your reading skills without you really thinking about it , or having to put in a lot of effort , so it really works out in the end .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [8], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [90], 'POS'), ([16, 17], [15], 'POS'), ([92, 93], [8], 'POS'), ([92, 93], [90], 'POS')]

Update - I actually had to use it . I tried to upgrade my machine ( win7 ) to win10 and had a lot of issues , where my workstation would just restart everytime I loaded the desktop . I needed to revert back to win7 which was 100 % stable . I loaded the recovery cd , chose the backup , partition target , and clicked finish . About an hour or so later , I was back to my stable win7 with no issues like nothing ever happened . Not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from , my guess ? NON-technical users using a technical backup program ! I 've been using Acronis for quite some time making backups and never had a glitch but also never had to use the rescue media . I just believed it worked . Well today my new Crucial MX100 512gb SSD came and I wanted to clone my HDD so I did n't have to reimage my workstation . Well , I crap you not 1 hour later the cloning process was done , I swapped out drives and windows instantly loaded , A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT QUICKER ! . Details - I have an m14xr2 alienware laptop with the caching msata drive . I opened up Acronis went to the cloning button and started away . I put the SSD in an enclosure and connected via USB . Once I hit finished , windows reboots so acronis can clone pre-post screen so it can get all the OS locked files . Hour later , I swapped out drives , and windows loaded fine with no errors , the auto driver detector popped up and installed the SSD drivers right away . My boot time went from 90-110 seconds with a long login wait time , to app launch time , to about 25 seconds from pressing the power button to signing in . Big difference is when I sign in , I can click on ANY app and it loads within milliseconds and I can use it 100 % without lag . Acronis is a truly remarkable product . If you have technical problems , like the guy and the 20 hour plus backup times , use GOOGLE and stop complaining about a SOLID product .#### #### ####[([29], [361], 'POS')]
The only reason I rated the software as four stars has nothing to do with the software directly - it is the process required to activate a renewal via &# 34 ; key code &# 34 ; , which is less than half the cost of 3PC software itself . It took 20 minutes to activate when it should have been a one-stop , 5 minute , effortless call . In order to activate the key , one must call McAfee CS - who may / may not speak conversational English . After struggling repeatedly to convey the key , a mixed 25 digit alpha-numeric code , he finally got it right , then told me that he would connect me with someone who would guide me through the operation (!) . When I reached that person - ( you guessed it ) - I had to repeat the key ID again on the same merry-go -' round . Totaling about 20 minutes of wasted time and frustration , I was finally able to download the software and install on my PCs. < br />< br /> The above not withstanding , McAfee Total Protection does an outstanding job . In my many years with McAfee , it has only allowed a few Trojans to make it to my machine . It has blocked numerous attempted breaches , access attempts , unsafe email , questionable web sites , etc . Even the Trojans were unable to do any damage whatsoever because the first scheduled ( HIGHLY recommended ) deep scan took them out ( the most recent being the Artmis virus x2 ) a few days ago . You ca n't go wrong with McAfee Total Protection in my experience , and the key code renewal is clearly a very cost-effective buy .#### #### ####[([44], [40], 'POS'), ([44], [300], 'POS')]

I purchased one of the first versions of UEC after it was released . There were still a few bugs being worked out , but it was still light years ahead of anything else I had used to create an ebook . Since then , it has been revised , refined , & updated over several versions , and now it seems to work flawlessly . Definitely the best and easiest way to create & format an ebook , short of paying someone to do it for you. < br /> As a side note , the creator of UEC , Nitin Mistry , is incredibly responsive , attentive , & helpful in providing one of the best customer support experiences I 've ever had ! The guy is definitely a class act. < br /> BOTTOM LINE : One of those rare products that under-promises & over delivers !< br />< br /> P.s .

The Key Card works perfectly if you just follow the simple instructions . I give it 4 instead of a 5 because of three installation issues . First , I needed to install the 64 bit version but was never able to successfully do that because some remnants of the 2010 32 bit version remained somewhere on my computer even after being removed through the control panel and that results in the refusal of the installation program to install the 64 bit version .

Second , customer service told be that I could install the 64 bit version of Publisher even if I install the rest of Office as 32 bit and I assure you that is not correct . Third , there is an add on ( Abby Find Reader ) that Epson provides with any of its products which keeps anything from working until it is removed . It took a tech an hour to remove them with a remote access program when all he had to do was say &# 34 ; Remove the Abby Fine Reader add-on in the Options tab of each application - here is a case number , call back if it does not work. &# 34 ; That whole process would have been under 3 minutes .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [25], 'POS'), ([75, 76], [25], 'POS'), ([75, 76], [72], 'POS'), ([156, 157], [72], 'POS'), ([123, 124], [4], 'POS'), ([123, 124], [25], 'POS')]

I have owned this router for less than 2 years ( purchased in November 2013 ) . The range and speed was acceptable , although , for the price I would have liked better . This would probably have been a 3 or 4 star review except , as of mid July , 2015 , it has stopped working properly . One day , out of the blue , it no longer provided an internet connection . The wireless network still exists but all devices attached show no internet connection . The same happens for any devices connected via Ethernet through the router . I have tried all the following in troubleshooting :< br /> 1 : connected straight to the modem and had an internet connection. < br /> 2 : Reset to factory settings and connected to default network but no internet. < br /> 3 : Connected replacement router via same ethernet cable to the modem and it provided internet without issue. < br /> 4 : checked router , power adapter , and Ethernet cable for any signs of damage ( we have a cat ) but none exist. < br />< br /> So , As a result , I am rather upset that this product did not even last 2 years . I paid $ 135 for this thing new .

I had to make a few modifications as the hole for the button and the corners are not quite correct . It took a number of fittings before it was acceptable .

I still recall the day I upgraded my 20GB Xbox 360 HD with a 100GB HD and thinking , &# 34 ; There , now I 'll never have to worry about storage again. &# 34 ; Fast forward 4 years , lots of Rock Band DLC and the ability to store full games to the HD and I find myself at about 90 % full . Enter the Seagate 2TB drive . Now I can have that feeling again of , &# 34 ; There , now I 'll never have to worry about storage again. &# 34 ;< br />< br /> This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive , priced similar to other 2TB drives , but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design . When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $ 350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $ 400 , you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives ( currently $ 100 ) and spend about $ 450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage . Basically , an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $ 50 , which is n't a bad deal . Of course , you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs. < br />< br /> The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive . While it was n't that difficult for me to figure out , it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work . Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product , it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive 's features included . I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content . It was not the most user friendly in that regard . I finished transferring data and was n't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive ( I was ) . A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360 , then upgrade to the Xbox One . I plan to do this in a few weeks , so I mayupdate the review if I hit any other snags in that process .#### #### ####[([32], [240], 'POS')]

I had to return this ( for a reason I ca n't recall , sorry , but I think it was n't due to any problems with the keyboard itself ) . I 'm pretty sure it worked fine , although I do n't like the way they position the Enter key . Apparently I 'm used to Dell keyboards because I 've used them for decades and now i 'm used to the Enter key being horizontally long and the \ key being above it . But it seems like most keyboards that I see these days have them switched , so when I use them I keep hitting / instead of Enter and it 's infuriating. < br />< br /> Sooner or later I 'll have to adjust since it appears to be the standard for newer keyboards .

So , I would n't have purchased this if it were not for my wife , who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup. < br />< br /> I needed something that would sit next to our TV , and be simple to use . The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus . The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I did n't know it could do ( does it via streaming ).< br />< br /> My problem is that I have this setup :< br />< br /> Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC ( streamed lossless FLAC ) . This then feeds into my preamp , and then amp and speakers . To access the linux computer that runs the whole show , I have to have her use shell login to my linux host ( not easy for most people , and if something goes wrong , she ca n't fix it ) . You can then from command line play pandora or music. < br />< br /> So , those issues being stated , after plenty of research , I chose this . I can connect this up right into my preamp , and she can use it pretty easily . The setup was a snap , follow a few instructions , and I 'm now linked up with my pandora account ( I 've got probably 40 stations I 've been grooming for years ) . Great. < br />< br /> I had mistook the &# 34 ; antenna &# 34 ; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM / FM antenna . In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router . Very fortunately , this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts ( which as it turns out , is almost all of the local stations ) . Not only that , but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all ( since I do n't rely on an antenna , just whatever I choose to stream ) . how do I get my local stations ? Simple ! you just set your location ( enter your city I believe ) . And it 'll select the right stations for where you are . It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you would n't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size . I live in Baltimore , and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away ! Very slick !!< br />< br /> The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality . However , I did n't buy this for that functionality anyway . I only ended up using it , as my preamp crapped out , and I 'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being . It 's nice that it 's available , but do n't think that if you have decent speakers , that you 'll get very good sound quality . You 're much better off using the ' line out ' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp , as the built in one just is n't so great , but it 's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size .

Day 20 November 2014 acquired the JBL portable load Indoor / Outdoor Bluetooth Speaker | Black and hardly used it and 6.16.15 she has stopped working . Just take full charge when left more than 24 hours , yet their working time is no more than 2hs . The few times I used , was always loaded with accessories that accompanied it . I live in Brasilia-DF Brazil , not with the product warranty or aq even there in the USA . She when turned on , provides a noise as if in short circuit and after a while for the noise . only is working connected to the charger. < br /> It is expensive and that left me high and dry. < br /> Disappointed .#### #### ####[([12, 13], [24], 'NEG'), ([12, 13], [126], 'NEG')]
I 'm really not qualified to review headphones , but some members on head-fi gave them really good reviews and so far they 're the best I 've had or used. < br /> They 're extremely clear , and while somewhat lacking on bass , you still feel and hear it it 's just not overpowering . Listening to these headphones is akin to the experience of eating Dark Chocolate .#### #### ####[([44], [42], 'POS')]
I was very dissapointed with the quality of the headphones they sound very low the battery dies in less then 2 hours which I find ironic because they are not even loud . The range from your phone to the actual headset is probably only like 2 feet because it disconnects everytime I got my phone in my pocket all around upset about the product especially for this price I could 've bought any one of the 30 or 40 dollar headphone and it probably would 've been the same or better#### #### ####[([15], [16], 'NEG'), ([6], [13], 'NEG'), ([6], [3], 'NEG'), ([9], [13], 'NEG'), ([9], [3], 'NEG')]

First off , I bought this product on sale for $ 25 off of Amazon . What a great deal , this bluetooth speaker is LOUD ! It 's got fair bass levels for the size and price point . Both front and back of the device emit sound , though front is louder . I think this gives it better quality and more range . I use this out by the pool and plan on using for fishing trips and tailgates . The only reason i did not give it 5 stars , when pressing the volume +/- the music stops for a &# 34 ; boop &# 34 ; noise . Also , when powering on , changing modes , or pairing a device , the speaker plays a womens voice that sounds almost comical . It 's a little goofy , but at this price point who cares . This speaker is comparable to high end units of the same size , with just slightly less bass. < br />< br /> Thanks Amazon !#### #### ####[([22, 23], [25], 'POS'), ([61], [60], 'POS')]

Bought Dec 6 , 2014 and worked great until today ... Now , the charger no longer charges and will not power the unit with the battery slide switch in OFF position . Checked the charger with a Volt Meter to be at 12.5 Vdc even with a 10 Ohm power resistor connected to it . Which means that the problem is in the Max A34 . Not very easy to take apart as everything is glued with a soft glue gun . Now it is an expensive paper weight . Doubt 1 year warranty is worth anything , but will look into it . Cannot recommend this product based on this experience .#### #### ####[([14], [60], 'NEG'), ([26, 27], [60], 'NEG'), ([64, 65], [60], 'NEG')]

I bought this 10 days ago . It was relatively easy to hook up . The auto-calibration took a few tries to get right , but I was pleased with the outcome . The sound was fantastic and really enhanced the viewing experience of my new Sony 4k 70 &# 34 ; television. < br />< br /> Today it died . I was watching Band of Brothers , and halfway through episode 3 the sound just died . I did my own troubleshooting ( I have an advanced degree in electrical engineering ) and then called Sony support . They ran me through a few steps , and then escalated me to another department . After being on hold for 40 minutes , the line kicked off and said that the office I was trying to reach was closed for the day. < br />< br /> So I am now 10 days into a three thousand dollar investment with Sony , and I am watching a football game with no sound while I type this. < br />< br /> My receiver was a poor product . And the support line was awful. < br />< br /> I am not happy .#### #### ####[([16], [77], 'NEG'), ([34], [36], 'NEG'), ([34], [186], 'NEG'), ([75], [77], 'NEG'), ([75], [171], 'NEG')]
These do not hold as long of a charge as the green-capped compeditors , even though the MW / hr is advertised to be higher .

Great product , sturdy , works like a breeze and came very handy for my rack ( attached picture ) . The two front receptacles are great when you work with a laptop in front of the rack and need to charge it , including your cell phone . I chose this version with and Amp meter , even though it still shows zero dot zero , but that 's because I ended up plugging in very light applications like cable modem , IR repeater , USB fan , etc . Otherwise , if you plug in a hair dryer for testing purposes , you will start seeing the amps come up . So it does work , and very well . It is only a few inches deep . Few tips : always leave some space above or below the unit , so that if you plug in AC / DC adapters ( those that come with small routers and modems ) , you will have enough clearance to plug the adapters in the back . Otherwise you can always buy those very short NEMA extensions to clear the path ( http :// www.amazon.com / C2G-Cables-03114-Outlet-Extension / dp / B0002J1KRQ / ref = sr _ 1 _ 4 ? ie = UTF8 & qid = 1440983975 & sr = 8-4 & keywords = nema + extension ) .

I bought one of these radios from BiMart about 4 years ago without listening to it ( the selection was very limited and I was in a big rush ) . I would not buy it again . The sound is tinny , it has no automatic shutoff ( a must for me ) , and the station tuning knob makes a huge change with only the slightest turn of the knob ; that shortcoming drives me nuts . I use it only on camping and hunting trips to receive the Weather Service weather reports and as a backup for my Sangean AM / FM portable radio ( love that one ) . I never could get it to work with the hand crank ; maybe I am not doing something right .

after a lightening strike wiped out my old receiver along with my music streaming devices ( Grace and Roku ) I was looking for an all in one 2 channel receiver that would stream internet radio , play Pandora type services and stream from my 400GB music database . After researching on line , I bought this unit. < br />< br /> It arrived today . Set up was easy . It took longer un untangle the rats nest of old wires than to set up the new unit . I connected my wired network and started to play around . The sound quality is excellent ! The choices of inputs are excellent as well . The one great shortcoming is the display panel . I cannot understand why Yamaha would put 1980 's technology into this otherwise modern , high quality system . It has a one line 13 character dot matrix display for alpha numeric messages , such as track name , station id etc . beyond me why they cut this corner. < br />< br /> What saves the day is the app . Yamaha NP Controller allows you to pretty much do everything from your android or iOS device . The app is smooth , fast and intuitive .

This product works well . My only complaint is that the plug-in cord is a little short to use on my bedroom TV . I ended up hooking it up in my son 's room . It was able to give it just enough boost he no longer has to move the antenna around to get the channel he wants . Installation is super simple . Basically it 's a plug and play . Or better yet a plug and watch. < br /> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review .#### #### ####[([12], [16], 'POS'), ([2], [3], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [16], 'POS')]

These headphones are a hit or miss . I 've ordered 3 pairs - the first one lasted a while but inevitably broke after years of good service. < br />< br /> So , I ordered a second pair . No bueno . It literally went bad on the 2nd listen ! ! I procrastinated calling the customer support number the headphones came with and eventually lost the little piece of paper , so I ended up buying a 3rd pair hoping the bad luck with the second was just a fluke. < br />< br /> The 3rd pair lasted literally a week before - it too broke . Basically , only one of the headphones receives sound - regardless of what the headphones are plugged into . No matter if it 's a computer , a phone or something else - only the headphone opposite of the mic works - which is quite inconvenient. < br />< br /> To make matters worse - half the time the sound quality of the working headphone is horrendous . Overall , I really regret giving JLab another chance and buying from them . Their newer models just do n't work . Not sure what happened to the quality of their products , but it 's crazy to have 2 different pairs of headphones stop working almost right away !< br />< br /> Beware !#### #### ####[([146], [178], 'NEG'), ([171, 172], [178], 'NEG')]

The only bad part about the head phones is if your using them via Bluetooth there is a flashing blue light that is not very noticible in a lighted room but in the dark you notice it in the perifirall vision .

This product works great despite severe hearing problems . I ca n't imagine it not being able to wake someone between the very loud alarm and the vibrations of the pod .

The main reason I picked this clock was because of the time projection . I was leery about it because I did n't think I would be happy . But , I 'm glad I went with this one . My deciding factor was the advertised aux input to use it as a speaker ( others did not say that was an option ) . It arrived quickly and was pretty easy to set up as well . The actual clock screen is able to be seen by me ( a wearer of glasses ) from where I lay about 8 feet away , and I aimed the projector across the room near the ceiling which is about 20 feet and I can see it perfectly .

1. The display is too bright , even on the lowest setting , for something you want in your bedroom at night. < br /> 2 . The “ snooze ” button actually only engages the snooze mode . You have to dial in the minutes on a second knob and then hit a third button to execute . Other clock radios have a single button that you hit and forget. < br /> 3 . The pre-select buttons are not lit , nor can you distinguish them by touch . Other clock radios have buttons and controls you can see or distinguish by touch in the dark. < br /> In addition , my unit is finicky : ( a ) It gets lost trying to buffer the stations , all while my other mobile devices are having no problem getting wifi from the same location . ( b ) Either the power supply input jack or the start button fails . I fiddle with them and the device eventually turns on. < br /> Finally , ten preset buttons is hardly enough .#### #### ####[([2], [5], 'NEG'), ([77, 78], [80, 81], 'NEG'), ([77, 78], [161], 'NEG')]

Sound quality was pretty good . I only used these for running and sometimes around the house . Reception was ok , but when running sometimes it would cut out . I synced the headphones to my phone which was carried in a runner ’s belt around my waist . My runs were usually an hour or 90 minutes . Besides the control box bouncing off my neck , these were the most reliable Bluetooth headphones I 've used so far . The reason for my return is what happened the past two Sundays in a row . Both Sundays my runs were longer 2 + hours . Both times the headphones were fully charged the night before and both times the headphones battery died at exactly 2 hours . The description says 6 + hours listening time on a full charge . Clearly that 's not true . Being returned and so begins the search again for small , reliable , long battery life Bluetooth headphones .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [4], 'NEG'), ([0, 1], [73], 'NEG'), ([18], [20], 'NEG'), ([18], [124], 'NEG')]
The people who are reporting fit problems on the MCX male side are n't crazy . The product photo shows a series of tiny vertical relief cuts around the outer conductor of the MCX male connector that provides a kind of springiness that allows the male connector to flex slightly and then grab onto the internal components of the MCX female connector . Well , my pigtail was manufactured without those relief cuts . No amount of pressure will allow the male connector to be inserted in my NooElec RTL-SDR dongle , because there is no flex whatsoever . Needless to say , I am disappointed . Every photo of a MCX male plug that I 've found online shows those relief cuts , so I assume they 're part of the spec and this was just a massive screw-up by quality control . Maybe other people 's MCX female ports have more flex to make up for it , but the plastic case of my RTL-SDR dongle wo n't even allow the rim of the male connector to pass . So now I 'm stuck between drilling out the plastic case of the dongle and hoping for the best , or using some kind of tool to slice two vertical slits in the connector on the MCX male port .#### #### ####[([33, 34], [6], 'NEG'), ([111, 112], [6], 'NEG'), ([111, 112], [105], 'NEG'), ([162, 163], [6], 'NEG'), ([162, 163], [48], 'NEG'), ([162, 163], [105], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [6], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [105], 'NEG'), ([148, 149], [6], 'NEG')]

The wood housing , like any wood body instrument , creates additional resonance - though prolonged use will get the best and warmest response as the wood goes through a break-down process , just like a wood body acoustic guitar. < br />< br /> Highs are very crisp , as well . I do prefer a mellow overall spectrum , yet I did finally find a decent Virtual EQ on the Apple Store that toned that treble right down , and boosted the bass even further . BEWM BEWM ... big bada BEWM. < br />< br /> Oh ya , big sound from an economical set. < br />< br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation , yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes , and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations .#### #### ####[([57], [103], 'POS'), ([57], [137], 'POS'), ([100], [103], 'POS'), ([139], [137], 'POS')]
I do n't have Dr Dre beats so I tested these on a normal pair of ear phones and I must say that they were a bit fiddly to fit but then once I had worked that out , they seemed perfectly ample for the job in hand. < br />< br /> The reason I have only given them 3 * is because they are being advertised as a replacement for an expensive set of earphones and I do n't think the quality is brilliant and i do n't think you would put these on expensive headphones. < br />< br /> But for a cheap and cheerful replacement for a set of cheap earphones , then these are ample .#### #### ####[([83], [27], 'NEU'), ([83], [85], 'NEU'), ([29], [27], 'NEU'), ([29], [85], 'NEU')]

I have purchased two of these charger . One was purchased for my wife to avoid confusion over charging requirement of various devices . The charger turned out to provide a great deal of convenience . She uses it for an iPad 4 , iPhone 5s , iPod Touch , Nook Glow Reader , Samsung Nook 7 inch tablet , Motarola Bluetooth headset and an Auxiliary Chargng Battery . Each of these charge without any issues . After approximately three months I purchased an additional one for my use . My use is about the same as above with a Sumsung Rugby phone instead of an iPhone . There has been no problem with any one or combination of devices . I believe the iPad 4 has the highest current draw of all of the devices . I have noted a 200mV drop in output voltage at approximately 2A load . That of course is undesirable but within spec . I spent to many years in power supply development to completely ignore that but also except it . I think this product should meet the requirements of most users both for home and travel . I recommend both the product and the brand .#### #### ####[([50, 51], [155], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [155], 'POS'), ([129, 130], [34], 'POS'), ([129, 130], [128], 'POS'), ([129, 130], [196], 'POS'), ([144, 145], [155], 'POS')]

This was very easy to mount to my TV . It comes with 3 different ways to mount ( on the wall , on the TV with adhesive , and on the TV with clips ) . I mounted it on my TV with the clips and it works much better than it did sitting on / in my TV stand . The remote signal is much better . I no longer have to aim the remote right at the Roku .

Really pleased with the ear cups . Has totally change all aspects of the headphones . For me , there has been an improvement in the upper frequencies , but most dramatically has really opened up the soundstage . Sounds totally different to what I had before .

Generally , I 'm a huge fan of Antennas Direct . My family has bought several of their products , including : a C4 , a C2 , a db8e , and this VHF retrofit kit. < br />< br /> To pull in a VHF station that is 43 miles away , we bought this kit that is listed having a range of 25-50 + miles . Aiming directly at the towers , I got 0 % signal , even without combining the antennas , mounting this directly on my mast. < br />< br /> Customer support at Antennas Direct says the range is good for 35 miles MAX . If they had written that on the product description instead of the confusing &# 34 ; 25-50 + miles &# 34 ; , I probably would n't have spent my whole afternoon on the roof. < br />< br /> This is a great solution if you 're looking to add short range VHF to your signal downlead . Watch out for medium or long range , it might not work . It 's just a pair of dipoles . If you have line of sight , you might be ok on longer range#### #### ####[([104], [106], 'NEG')]

This worked well throughout my trip to Korea . I was on a 10 day trip and a number of us had the exact same one - everybody reported success . The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the following :< br /> a ) the price as a bit high in my opinion ( I paid over $ 45 . I think this is more like $ 29.99 ).< br /> b ) it did n't really charge my phone that fast . I tried multiple different ports to charge it but all were fairly slow ( like overnight for a full charge ).< br />< br /> All in all though I am satisfied . I would buy it again . And I do plan to use it on future travels#### #### ####[([50], [54], 'POS'), ([50], [119], 'POS')]
I got this player for free , but it took so long to receive it , I forgot how I got it for free. . Anyway I have loaded it with just one cd for now . I charged it for about a day and a half , and it still will not play ,( the red light never did go out ) . I took the headphones and tried them in another device and they work , ( although very low quality ) . I went online to see if there was some kind of a manual and I was unable to find anything . I keep going back and trying to get it to work because it 's perfect in size for a lot of different times I would like to use it. < br /> All I can say is it 's a good thing I did n't pay for it .

We have been able to receive 19 channels with this antenna . The installation was easy and we have it mounted on an interior wall .

Excellent little Bluetooth speaker . Bought at Costco and am amazed at this bargain . No nonsense loud voices telling if you 're connected or not ( finally !!) and the sound is outstanding considering the size of this item . I use it mainly in my car to listen to lectures and occasionally some music too . One thing that could be improved is the loudness although as is it fits the bill quite well . Where this thing impressed me the most though , is with its outstanding speakerphone capability . Not one complain yet from anyone I 've spoken to through this little gizmo and that for me was a real deciding factor as tons of little BT speakers have as loud or louder a sound , long lasting battery , yadi yada ... but their speakerphone in general mostly stink at best ... this guy however pulls it off nearly as well as my way more expensive Sony SRS X3 !!< br /> Cool design and colors BTW . Battery lasts quite many hours . Have not timed it but 6-7 hours minimum I 'd say. < br /> Charges pretty fast too. < br /> READ THE INSTRUCTIONS !! ! Most reviewers are complaining about loosing the BT connection settings after turning it off . Some even mention the ridiculously long time it takes to shut it down lol. < br /> Once paired if you click the on / off button just once for a short second OR LESS the speaker will alternate between the on and off mode and go in standby mode . If you hold the button for a few seconds then a complete shutdown happens and therefore the connection settings may be lost . This in fact is a very welcome and refreshing function ( like my Sony SRS X3 ) as holding the button down for a stupid amount of time is what 's required on most low to mid end BT speakers and I personally ca n't stand it . It 's unnecessary and annoying . This one , one quick click it 's off , one quick click and it 's on ... And remember , NO annoying voices either .... I love that ! Essentially a very well engineered piece of electronics . Btw it does mentioned being engineers in the USA and made in China . I 'm not surprised by the results especially the speakerphone function ( ca n't stress its usefulness enough ).< br /> Anyways , read the instructions and enjoy this remarkable and recommendable BT speaker. < br /> I 'm probably gonna purchase a couple more for the price they sell. < br /> I absolutely and easily recommend this item .#### #### ####[([31], [33], 'POS'), ([31], [167], 'POS'), ([90], [130, 131], 'POS'), ([128], [33], 'POS'), ([128], [167], 'POS'), ([132], [130, 131], 'POS'), ([170], [33], 'POS'), ([170], [167], 'POS'), ([193], [195], 'POS'), ([410, 411], [195], 'POS'), ([410, 411], [413, 414], 'POS'), ([168], [33], 'POS'), ([168], [167], 'POS')]

It 's surprising how hard it is to find an alarm clock when you do n't use an iphone or ipad . This one is n't too bad . I like the night light availability .

The connection is good ! The aux cable and port do n't work for my second screen . You will probably have to find extra speakers to be able to use sound .

Received as a gift , was surprised at how punchy and clean the bass is , and how good the sound quality is over-all . I always have the bass bazuca on because I just like to have more bass in most everything I listen to . If you want a good music system with some punchy bass , that does n't cost you an arm and a leg , than try this out . Only con is that the buttons on actual receiver on the unit can take a few seconds , or just not work at all . Though the remote works very well .#### #### ####[([13], [11], 'POS'), ([13], [56], 'POS'), ([20, 21], [18], 'POS'), ([20, 21], [95, 96], 'POS'), ([20, 21], [105], 'POS'), ([57], [11], 'POS'), ([57], [56], 'POS'), ([80], [95, 96], 'POS'), ([102], [18], 'POS'), ([102], [105], 'POS')]

The lamp works perfectly . The reason I am giving 4 starts instead of 5 is because even though my TV is included among the compatible ones ( WD-65638 ) I was not able to make it fit using the included housing ( was too big ) . I tried for several minutes but the change must be a minimal size difference because at first glance both housings are pretty much identical . I gave up in trying to make it fit with the included housing and finally I just resorted to taking the lamp out of it and put it inside the old housing that had the busted lamp. < br />< br /> I would advise anyone that purchases this lamp to keep your old housing on hand instead of getting rid of it right away in case you are faced with the same problem that I had .#### #### ####[([41], [32, 33], 'POS'), ([41], [45], 'POS'), ([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [3], 'POS')]
The TaoTronics Model TT-SK08 is a rugged looking , waterproof , outdoor Bluetooth speaker . It comes in an attractive box , which includes a manual in several languages , a USB charger cable , an audio cable , but no charger . You have to use the USB charger included with your phone , tablet or use the one on your computer. < br /> The speaker comes with a built-in rechargeable battery . It is not clear whether the battery can be replaced - perhaps by unscrewing the cover on the speaker . There is no indicator on the speaker of how much battery life is left . But an interesting feature is that next to the bluetooth icon on my iPhone / iPad there is a battery charge level indicator for the speaker . Advertised play time is pretty long but I did not verify. < br />< br /> The speaker uses the newer Bluetooth 4 standard . Volume changes on device and speaker are in sync , which is a lot more convenient . However , the volume buttons do not have a second function to skip forward / backward like they have on < br /> Taotronics other models. < br />< br /> You can pair more than one Bluetooth device with the speakers . However , the manual does not list how many devices can be paired with speaker. < br />< br /> The bluetooth range is great and covers at least 30ft plus . Keep in mind that this is a Mono speaker . I would not call this speaker bidirectional since most of the sound is coming out the front . I believe the Bass is supposed to come out of the back Sound is a bit thin but quite acceptable for a speaker of this size and prize , and definitely loud enough across the room. < br />< br /> The speaker has a microphone and can therefore be used as a speaker phone . The speaker plays the ring tone of your phone . A conversation on the phone was loud and clear and the microphone worked fine. < br />< br /> The speaker can be put on a flat surface , has a large rubber handle and a tripod screw underneath . The rubberized covering looks strong and sturdy . I did not test how waterproof the speaker is. < br />< br /> Overall a great outdoor speaker , great packaging , easy to read manual with clear contact information . A suggestion would be to include a travel pouch since you may want to throw this speaker in a beach bag or hiking backpack .#### #### ####[([31, 32], [392], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [394], 'POS'), ([73], [84], 'POS'), ([81], [84], 'POS'), ([129, 130], [246], 'POS'), ([158, 159], [157], 'POS'), ([158, 159], [177], 'POS'), ([158, 159], [298], 'POS'), ([158, 159], [379], 'POS'), ([158, 159], [419], 'POS'), ([243, 244], [177], 'POS'), ([243, 244], [246], 'POS'), ([243, 244], [379], 'POS'), ([243, 244], [419], 'POS'), ([294], [177], 'POS'), ([294], [298], 'POS'), ([294], [301], 'POS'), ([294], [416], 'POS'), ([294], [419], 'POS'), ([359], [177], 'POS'), ([389, 390], [84], 'POS')]

Love this ... sturdy , easy to use . Great sound . Controls a little different from my older one , but I figured them out ... Specifically sound and turning off .

I cut the cord a while ago with cable but the NFL is back and I wanted CBS , ABC , NBC and FOX . I get all of them in perfect clarity with 30 some odd other random channels that can be entertaining .

I have this on the first floor about 5 feet from the nearest window just standing there next to my PS4 and it 's clear as day . I did n't have to try and turn it east / west or shoot lightning at it with a Tesla Coil to get a proper signal. < br />< br /> I just plugged it in , ran the channel scan , and a few minutes later it worked. < br />< br /> I used this before i purchased http :// transition.fcc.gov / mb / engineering / dtvmaps /< br /> It 's a 25 mile HD antenna and i 'm 15 miles from the signal so make sure you check that first. < br />< br /> Good luck !#### #### ####[([32], [31], 'POS'), ([32], [75, 76], 'POS'), ([73], [75, 76], 'POS')]

Ok,from what I 've seen , this converter keeps all the data transfered from audio / video ( RCA ) to HDMI . It only helps with the extra power supplied ( most adaptors are simply cables / wires ).< br /> This is exactly what I needed , since I 've used both rca to HDMI and HDMI to rca , I can say this is a fantastic product. < br /> The only thing I would like to see is a power brick ( cell phone USB to outlet ) included-free of course,because they 're at the dollar store and are needed to plug the usb power cord into .

I ca n't say enough about this splitter . With someone in the bedroom next to ours , my wife and I often watch movies or TV shows later at night using headphones. < br /> What makes these exceptional is the separate volume control on each side .

I used this mount to install an older , and heavier , Toshiba 37 &# 34 ; LCD TV in my home tiki bar . The mount was inexpensive , easy to install and it 's well made especially at this price point . I liked the fact that it would adjust upwards from a 20 &# 34 ; ceiling to mount measurement . I needed the 20 &# 34 ; mount measurement . Yes , the allen screw that holds the swivel mount would eventually keep loosening if the television is swiveled frequently but there 's a long enough bolt that it wo n't happen overnight .

I received this cable on August 25 , 2015 . I had purchased it for use in a hifi system along with a Wharfedale 8 &# 34 ; subwoofer . I had read good things , but I was still surprised by the quality of this cable when it arrived . I also use BlueRigger HDMI cables , and I am very happy with those , so I bought this as well . It is a very thick , dual shielded cable , and the ends are gold plated and fit snugly with no play . It was exactly what I needed . Bass was crisp and clear , no hum or interference . I ended up replacing this with a MediaBridge cable because I discovered that if I used a cable with a split mono lead , I could get a bit more input level and a noticeable gain in output . I wish that BlueRigger made a split mono version . I briefly considered buying a small splitter adapter and a second one of these because of how nice it is , but the cost would have been too high . If your subwoofer uses a crossover that only requires a single RCA connection , then this is the cable to get . If you can get a bit more level using a splitter , or a split mono cable , then go that route because there is a noticeable difference. < br />< br /> Pros :< br />- Thick , high quality cable < br />- Gold plated ends < br />- Snug fitting < br />- No hum or interference ( dual shielded )< br />< br /> Cons :< br />- Not offered in a split mono version < br />< br /> All in all , I will be using more BlueRigger products in the future and I look forward to seeing their line expand . I rate this cable at 5 / 5 stars and highly recommend BlueRigger products . For the cost vs. quality this is easily one of the best brands on Amazon .#### #### ####[([43], [191], 'POS'), ([43], [266], 'POS'), ([43], [349], 'POS')]

This is a nice little player for someone who likes to listen to tunes on the go . It 's not as fancy as some of its more expensive counterparts , but for the price it gets the job done nicely. < br />< br /> The color is really pretty and has a nice shimmer to it . I really like it , gotta love anythings that 's pretty to look at . As far as the performance , since it comes with a 16 GB Micro SD card , it holds a TON of songs . You can replace the SD card in this player , however you can not expand it . 16 GB is the maximum that it can handle , so that is something to keep in mind . I love filling mine up if I am taking a day trip and do n't want to risk losing my more expensive players . This is perfect for that. < br />< br /> It is plug and play for the most part , though if you are trying to follow the included instructions I found them to be a bit confusing .

This unit replaces a decades-old Radio Shack model that died . This one does n't suddenly blast out an exceedingly high volume warning tone like the old one did ( which always scared the living daylights out of us ) .

I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend and I must say this is a great speaker , the sound quality is good and the light feature is neat . We really enjoyed watching the lights on the color display however after further research my boyfriend decided the JBL Charge 2 plus was more practical for him . He will be using the speaker at work in an outside environment and it is better for outdoor use , there are 2 subs on the end so it provides a better base sound . The charge 2 can charge your phone and allow up to 3 bluetooth devices to be connected vs. the JBL Pulse which will only allow one. < br />< br /> Overall if you are looking for a cool light display the JBL Pulse might be for you , but if you are looking for more practicality and versatility I would recommend the JBL Charge 2 .#### #### ####[([20, 21], [16], 'POS'), ([20, 21], [23], 'POS'), ([20, 21], [132], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [29], 'POS'), ([49, 50], [29], 'POS')]
This speaker is amazing and straightforward , especially for the price . It is easy to use and includes some cool features . so I was a little skeptical of the quality. < br /> It can be paired with most devices with Bluetooth and is also compatible with most devices that have a 3.5mm port. < br /> The package included one usb cable , one 3.5mm audio cable , bike holder , and user manual . I am not sure how far the range will work , I have used it up to about 15-20 feet away without any problems . The speaker performs really well and would work great . Good bass !

I originally wanted a music player that was cheap and had a vast expandable memory slot for just listening to music on-the-go . Though , it seemed like I would have to sacrifice one or the other , I was going to get an unlocked smart phone until I came across this guy . It 's not perfect , however , I rate it 5 stars for what you get for $ 100 . Do n't be fooled either , It is an amazing player that I believe is more favorable over an iPod Classic and other expensive Hi-Res Players. < br /> At first glance , It looks like a knock-off of a smaller version of an iPod Classic which greets you with an expeditious boot-up and on to the main screen that will throw you off a bit . It 's easy to navigate using the mechanical jog wheel which feels sturdy and has minimal leeway . The settings are simple to understand and has tech manual included if you decide you need to use it after you 've thrown it out . The chassis feels solid even with the plastic back panel and comes with a silicone case too if you 're feeling skeptical . The battery is long lasting ( approximately 11 hours ) and has a micro USB jack to charge it. < br /> There are two types of ways to view your music : File Mode and Category Mode . In File Mode , It will appear exactly how you arrange your files or music on your removable drive window on your computer which allows users to customize and organize their music listings , for example , I sorted my music by Artist &# 62 ; Album &# 62 ; Songs . This will require some time and can be fixed by updating your files in settings which will automatically designate your music based on the files' detailed information under Category Mode . The only drawback to Category Mode , which I believe is the only major drawback , is that you can only store 5800 songs in Category Mode yet you can have as many songs as your MicroSD card can fit under File Mode. < br /> Some of the user interface abilities could have been improved but unfortunately , Fiio has stopped making updates for the X1 and will soon be replaced by the X3 Next Generation . All in all , this player has exceeded my expectation and I will try out some lose-less music to see the true potential of the X1 .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [143], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [162], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [332], 'POS'), ([14], [153], 'POS'), ([148, 149], [153], 'POS'), ([148, 149], [385], 'POS'), ([186], [143], 'POS'), ([186], [162], 'POS'), ([186], [188], 'POS')]

Loved this product , got it as a gift and really worth every bit . The material is solid and most importantly the sounds are crisp and clear compared to my laptop speakers . Being boombox speakers , I can blast the sound to share music with friends , play movies , or even just jam out and I do n't lose quality of the sound .

I own a pair of in-ear Bose phones which I use , one ear only when driving .

How cute is this !< br />< br /> This cute little bluetooth speaker has some BASS !< br />< br /> I set this on a table and the box was next to it , and the box was bumping up and down with the bass .

I recieved two of these antennas . The first one does a fair job of channel reception . I have a couple of another brand and these are equivalent to those at a reduced price . Now for the criticism . Of the two that I recieved , only one was usable . One installed easily on my television , on the second one they neglected to thread the connect and therefore it will not install on a tv so it is worthless to me or anyone else . Given the low price , I expect that I will throw it away rather than both with attempting to return half of an order .#### #### ####[([16], [12], 'NEU'), ([16], [91], 'NEU'), ([15, 16], [12], 'NEU'), ([34], [12], 'NEU'), ([34], [91], 'NEU'), ([92], [91], 'NEU')]

I bought these from BestBuy a few weeks back , and I am incredibly disappointed with their shockingly poor quality. < br />< br /> After using them regularly , I suddenly noticed that the left-channel was slightly softer than the right-channel . This situation continued until the audio in the right-channel unexpectedly decided one day to disappear entirely. < br />< br /> I suspect that the wiring inside the earbud has broken , and this should tell you everything you need to know about its poor construction. < br />< br /> Now , the left-channel is barely functioning and sounds muffled one minute and then fine the next . Again , I suspect the poor construction is the culprit. < br />< br /> I could technically RMA them to Sony as it is within 30 days , but I do n't see the point on wasting money on shipping that could go towards a better pair from a different manufacturer. < br />< br /> Bottom line : Do n't buy , or you 'll regret it .#### #### ####[([118], [117], 'NEG'), ([118], [18], 'NEG'), ([118], [38], 'NEG'), ([35], [117], 'NEG'), ([35], [18], 'NEG'), ([35], [38], 'NEG'), ([41], [117], 'NEG'), ([41], [18], 'NEG'), ([41], [38], 'NEG'), ([41], [103], 'NEG'), ([68], [73], 'NEG'), ([68], [99, 100], 'NEG'), ([97], [117], 'NEG'), ([97], [38], 'NEG'), ([97], [73], 'NEG'), ([97], [99, 100], 'NEG'), ([97], [103], 'NEG')]

Louder than I expected and the sound quality is good . I like the design and it 's easy to carry with me around the house .

Great cable . Fits my HD598s perfectly and the red cable with black sleeving matches the brown on the headset much better than the black cable that came with the headphones .

I bought this product after reading many reviews that did n't have much detail or specifics , such as TV size , type , equipment model numbers , viewing distance , default TV settings or optimized , room lighting , 2D / 3D , which are all factors that impact viewing clarity . I purchased the product to experiment and provide that detail in one review . Overall this product DID bring out additional detail when viewed up close , it was just not noticeable from the location where we watch the TV in 2D or 3D . This is why I have given it an &# 34 ; OK &# 34 ; rating . We sit approximately 11 feet away from the TV in a completely dark room directly in front of the TV ( No angle ) . I did n't really notice any difference until I was 2 feet away from the front of the TV . The unit has a test mode where one half of the picture has been clarified and the other half has not , for your comparison . We primarily watch movies in Blu-ray or up-converted DVD 's and all my equipment is Samsung . ( TV has been setup to provide optimum color and clarity . ( Not setup with factory default settings ) . TV Model Number : PN64D550C1F . Blu-ray player Model number is HT-D550 ) . I also tried it on our cable input to see if that made much of a difference . It did not . Again , from our viewing position , we sit too far away for it to provide any noticeable improvement in clarity. < br /> To sum up , it works as defined but really did not provide us with a better viewing experience for the size and type of TV based on the viewing distance we watch from . This unit is somewhat expensive and I would not recommend its purchase for TV 's of my size and type or smaller . I think it is really designed for very large screen projector style TV 's .#### #### ####[([37, 38], [49], 'NEU')]
It 's a solid cable , well designed . My only caveat , though it 's a big one , is that it 's remote functionality is non-existent on my device. . The volume control & answer call button are guaranteed to work with ALL Samsung designed Android devices , but I have a Droid Turbo . From reading other reviews , it 's a crop-shoot as to the level of functionality it may have with your android device . I 've had my Momentums for 2 years now , & this cable makes them sound great again , better than new in fact as it is true high-end headphones sound better with age ! ! Also , notice the end of the cable you plug in , the &# 34 ; low-profile angled plug &# 34 ; ; it has been redesigned as to decrease it 's chance of breaking off or getting in the way of things . Wanted to give 5 stars , but cannot for the reason aforementioned . I hope Sennheiser releases a more universally compatible remote cable such as this in future , though the blame may be more on the device manufacturer side ... Motorola !#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], [27], 'NEU')]

I have many other bluetooth headsets and this one has the expected range of about 15-25 feet maximum with clear line of sight to your phone or computer . However the audio will cut out here and there very so often.For under $ 15 the pair is ok for music . I do not recommend it for more than that price and I do not recommend it for video playback as the cheaper chipset inside loses slight connection even in clear line of sight to the bluetooth source and your video goes out of audio sync and that ruins it as a video playback bluetooth headset . Its mostly made of cheaply put together plastic so durability is not the greatest but its good enough if you take care and caution when putting then back in your backpack or purse etc . The fit is good and they say put for the most part , even though the wing tips that come with them are pretty much useless as they do not give a tight secure fit like many of the other more expensive bluetooth headsets do . I do not think they will be very sweat resistant so if you are a heavy sweater you may want to look elsewhere . However I cannot say for sure bc I do not not sweat a lot and even though its a cheap plastic build they do have the slightest of separation from your ear in that its hard to get actual drops of sweat on them unless you have longer hair and its wet or again are a real heavy sweater or runner etc. < br />< br /> There are many generic branded versions of this headset ( Mpow , iclever etc ) and some are a little better with a better chipset and have aptx certification ( supposedly , and its supposedly supposed to be better more CD like quality sound ) so the filesonic version of this headset is the cheaper version but it sounds good enough for everyday or gym use . Im no audiophile and sound is subjective , but its good enough for me and on par with many other sets I have . I can only tell a slight decrease in quality vs the aptx certified version I also have but its so slight that Im sure only audiophiles can tell the difference. < br />< br /> Overall I would recommended them for about $ 15 bucks or cheaper and pretty much for music only use and possibly the gym if you are not a runner or heavy sweater.br /> Overall I would recommended them for about $ 15 bucks or cheaper and pretty much for music only use and possibly the gym if you are not a runner or heavy sweater .#### #### ####[([31], [33, 34], 'NEU'), ([31], [167], 'NEU'), ([73], [302], 'NEU'), ([143], [145], 'NEU'), ([158, 159], [33, 34], 'NEU'), ([158, 159], [167], 'NEU'), ([303], [302], 'NEU'), ([378], [302], 'NEU'), ([378], [33, 34], 'NEU')]
I 'm upgrading from a Yamaha Aventage 2000 receiver which still works great . I decided to upgrade because I wanted a receiver that does Dolby Atmos and DTS : X and also has HDMI 2.0a : and HDCP 2.2 support . There have been many improvements over the last five years which have been incorporated into the receiver . ( Too many to mention . ) It plays louder , has a smoother , more balanced sound , and seems to run cooler than my old unit . It took about thirty minutes to get everything set up including a basic calibration . ( I 'm coming from a previous Yamaha receiver so I knew what to expect , but the quick set-up guide makes it pretty simple to get started for people not used to the Yamaha brand . ) Forgot to add : The standard antennae-connected radio works great .

I received this as a free review sample five months ago and have sporadically used it on both a budget tablet that did not have bluetooth and on a few phones. < br />< br /> What I like is has an internal battery that charges up and will power this speaker for at least five hours . What I dislike is the charging cable is not a standard USB micro , but a barrel connector type that is not easily replaced if the one that ships with this is lost or damaged . I subtracted a star from the rating because of that issue. < br />< br /> The sound quality is more than acceptable considering the price and size of this speaker . The high , mid and low frequencies are nicely reproduced and the highs are not shrill . No , it is n't audiophile quality , but it is good enough for casual listening . Plus it 's a LOT better than the internal speakers in my phone , tablets or even my laptop. < br />< br /> If you have a non-bluetooth device ( and there are surprisingly many tablets in this day and age that are not equipped with bluetooth ) this speaker is an inexpensive solution .#### #### ####[([42, 43], [116], 'POS'), ([63, 64], [60], 'POS'), ([111, 112], [116], 'POS'), ([132], [134], 'POS'), ([168, 169], [60], 'POS'), ([168, 169], [165], 'POS')]

I did a lot of research on batteries before restocking , and I am glad I did . I had been using the bigger name brands you can get at the store before , and now that I have been using these , there is no way I 'd go back . These batteries keep their charge for longer than any other battery I 'd tried . Many of my other batteries I feel I have to charge twice as often . They charge quickly , and I can forget about them in my electronics for months before having to think about putting them back on the charger . It 's a few more bucks , but totally worth it .#### #### ####[([56], [58], 'POS')]

I was replacing a previous SEIKO 8000 small handheld fantastic help for my crosswords . It looked smart and had , apparently more functions than the one I bought as an urgent replacement which has no shut down cover ; fewer functions and I paid more over the odds for an inferior object.I daily see the same object I have advertised much cheaper than I paid . Daily I get frustrated with the lack nof info available on this object . The firm that delivered it did it swiftly as I paid extra for that - but I have the feeling I was taken for a ride by what I paid for it. .< br /> good for them .#### #### ####[([23], [22], 'NEG'), ([41], [40], 'NEG')]

Bought a pair of these through my school and was completely disappointed . First of all the sound was dismal . There was a very small range and the quality was sub-par . Along with this , the bass was almost non-existent and the sound got worse over the two months I used them . After about two months the casing started falling apart until I could not actually use them anymore . These are nothing but &# 34 ; designer &# 34 ; headphones trying to get you to pay more for a brand name , same thing as beats .#### #### ####[([17], [19], 'NEG'), ([17], [31], 'NEG'), ([38], [31], 'NEG'), ([38], [41], 'NEG'), ([38], [46], 'NEG'), ([44], [31], 'NEG'), ([44], [41], 'NEG'), ([44], [46], 'NEG'), ([29], [31], 'NEG'), ([29], [41], 'NEG'), ([29], [46], 'NEG'), ([60], [62, 63], 'NEG')]

I was a big fan of HK and my love for HK started with audio system in my BMW . With that experience , I bought this sound bar for an apartment living and this is truly the biggest failure and the worst decisions I have ever made . Many of my friends started looking for sound bars,since I already bought this piece , they started asking me for my review and I suggested them to go look for some other brand except HK . So one of my friend ended buying Bose and other one ended up buying Sonos . The moment I heard those systems,both of them have completely thrown me off and I liked Sonos the most. < br />< br /> Second biggest UPSET , CUSTOMER SERVICE . I have never expected from HK having such a sloppy and nasty customer service . This is my last visit to HK and I will never buy nor recommend any of my friends buying HK products. < br />< br /> You have to take a serious action pretty soon and failure in doing so will lead to RIP HK ......< br />< br /> GOOD BY FOR EVER ....... .#### #### ####[([145], [143], 'NEG'), ([145], [39], 'NEG'), ([145], [42], 'NEG'), ([129, 130], [42], 'NEG'), ([144, 145], [143], 'NEG'), ([144, 145], [42], 'NEG')]

Wish I could give 0 stars . The wind destroyed this after a few weeks . First week or so , the aluminum loop in the back , ripped and fell off. < br /> The plastic rotor area broke a week later. < br /> The remote for the rotor works on similar frequencies as other remote controls . Everytime we 'd scroll through Netflix or turn volume up / down - the antenna would move . Since there 's no position indicator , takes a bit too reposition the antenna. < br /> All things considered , I can find no reason to purchase this model .

Definitely better than the 25 mile version , the pictures are n't grainy and it seems to receive reception better . However , there is one flaw and I cannot figure out why even this one wo n't pick PBS up . The broadcasting tower is well within the reach of the antennas , both the 25 mile and this one . According to antenna finding websites the PBS broadcasting tower is 7-8 miles near my home and yet the 25 mile antenna did not pick it up and neither does this one. < br /> But if you must purchase an antenna I highly recommend this one over the 25 mile one . This one does n't drop channels and it does not show them grainy .#### #### ####[([18], [19], 'POS')]

I was super excited to get this MP3 / MP4 Player , as I have a grand daughter who LOVES music and is always asking for the tablet , so she can get on Pandora . I took this out of the box , plugged it up , charged it , and then turned it on . One I figured out how to use it , I decided it was best to just let her use the FM Radio part of the player and then I would put music on it at a later point . She played with it for about an hour maybe two , and it needed to be charged again . The problem is , it wo n't charge ! I have no idea why it wo n't charge now , as it charged when I first got it .

These are great headphones , I did a lot of searching and even sent back some Seinheisers that did n't have what I was looking for . Let me make one thing clear , the quality of this headphone can be replicated by cheaper headphones , BUT ... not if you amp them . I went 2 months without an amp and they were great , dug real low on movies with bass and , well there are other reviews about the awesome sound but frankly it 's a flat EQ ( which was done on purpose and is a good thing ) but I bought them for their bass capabilities not for their ability to replicate audio without ' tarnishing ' it . I used a Fiio E17k and these things WOKE UP . You can adjust the bass , treble , and whatnot to remain flat and even then these things sound better . Add + 4 or + 6 to the bass EQ though and these are FUN. < br /> Some people mention that when you get high end headphones like these and an amp it just makes bad music stick out more , it is unfortunately very true . I can immediately tell which tracks on my ipod or on Youtube were downloaded at low quality , it 's painful to listen to ... but it 's completely worth it when you find good HQ tracks because these babies put you in the studio . Bass guitars have concert like depth , highs are not shrill , the amp completely brings back the mids that some people have complained about not being up to par , and if you throw on techno / trap / rap ... if you 're into that sort of thing ... the D600s are thrilling . ss ...< br /> Long story short , these are great by themselves , but if you want to actually experience them the way they are meant to be experienced , and have some hard hitting ( not distorted or overbearing ) bass - GET THEM with an AMP !!!!< br /> Sidenote , I almost did n't buy these because of a negative review about the headband being uncomfortable , but I have a buzzcut , a normal sized / shaped head ( I think ) and I have these on for hours at a time with no trouble . They are in fact extremely comfortable and I 've never had to take them off out of annoyance .#### #### ####[([90], [89], 'POS'), ([90], [344], 'POS'), ([90], [375], 'POS'), ([139], [89], 'POS'), ([268], [89], 'POS'), ([268], [375], 'POS')]

Last year , I finally transitioned to a flat screen TV . It was n't new , but it was new to me . Until then , I was n't really sure what all of the whole HDMI thing was about . It just looks like a fatter USB plug if you do n't have HDMI . Imagine my surprise when my older electronics also needed to be replaced with newer ones and they all required or suggested an HDMI connection . That 's great , if your TV has more than one HDMI port !< br />< br /> My older TV works beautifully , so I could n't justify buying another TV just to get more HDMI ports . After looking around , I found several brands of multi-port HDMI plug and play units . I decided on the HausBell 3-Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3-In-1-Out ( Hdmi V1.3 ) Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter. < br />< br /> I was nervous about setting this up , but it was easy and fast . It literally took about 2 minutes from the time I took it out of the package until I was watching TV using the HausBell 3-Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3-In-1-Out Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter . I plugged my Apple TV into the adapter and the adapter into the back of my TV . I switched the TV and Apple TV back on but the Apple TV did n't switch on . I moved the Apple TV to the second port on the adapter and it was fully functional. < br />< br /> The picture quality is as good as it was when I had the Apple TV connected directly to the TV . I may now brave up and hook up the DVD player next. < br />< br /> Disclosure : I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item . However , this did not influence my review . All opinions are true and my own .#### #### ####[([48, 49], [47], 'POS'), ([48, 49], [152], 'POS')]

Works great . I use this to connect a Canon Vixia camera to an HDMI splitter . That signal is sent to multiple TVs to live stream speakers and singers. < br />< br /> WORD OF ADVICE : Check your device to see which way the port is turned .

Worked well for my application . Couple things to keep in mind :< br />- The edges are as sharp as razor blades . Wear adequate hand protection . I had some deep cuts before I smartened up. < br />- You can get these ties tight but they are not zip ties. < br />- It is very easy to damage / distort the ball bearing housing while tightening . If that happens , the tie wo n't tighten and you have to start over with a new one. < br />- Amazon sells a tensioning tool for these ties . I purchased it and save your money . To tighten , I used a pair of wire clippers and a flat head screwdriver . Manually tighten the tie until you ca n't tighten any more . Clamp the wire clippers on the extra length of tie near the ball bearing housing . Take your flat head , rest against the wire clippers , and gently push the ball bearing housing further up the tie . Snipe off the excess tie. < br />- It has been over a month and none of the ties have loosened .#### #### ####[([16], [19], 'POS'), ([65, 66], [61], 'POS'), ([65, 66], [63], 'POS')]

This has replaced our regular radio and did so easily . Frankly put , Internet radio is where radio is today . Not only do many commercial stations have an Internet feed , but many Internet only stations exist some of which are commercial free. < br />< br /> For us , the chief joy of this device over the old tech which only receives local signals is that we can get stations from all over the world . This allows us to listen to shows we could never expect to get locally plus we listen Internationally . Those guys in Zimbabwe really rock out . Once you try this , you 'll see how limited regular radio - even subscriber radio such as Sirius - is. < br />< br /> Let me say this : if you think the news is reflected by the US outlets such as CNN , Fox , MSHAHA or whatever , you are missing a lot. < br />< br /> This is a huge heavy device with a relatively small non-touch screen . Setup is n't difficult except make sure your ISP opens Port 80 before you start . This is usually closed by default . Once online , you register your unit with Grace and you 're off and running. < br />< br /> The sound is decent if not great . There is a built in equalizer if you want to make your own output bias so the complaints here about lack of bass are , to me , baseless . Boost the bass if you want. < br />< br /> We have ours hooked to a pair of JBL speakers through a homemade little 20w amp which makes the sound quite nice . You can get such amps for less than $ 20 from all the usual suspects. < br />< br /> The device comes complete to hook into a few services notably Pandora . Browsing through the huge selections of Internet stations is daunting using the radio itself . This is made much easier using the iOS or Android ( Windows phones do n't apply ) app available for free at the usual outlets. < br />< br /> We use iOS here and found the app to be sluggish and annoying on two iPhone 6 's but quite useful on iPads G3 and G5 . Programming presets and browsing the Internet is so much easier using the app that I doubt one would much enjoy this device having to navigate by relying on the small screen located in the radio . The remote works well but is limited to LOS being infrared. < br />< br /> I 'd really like to have seen a larger screen located on top of the unit which is touch capable and the addition of Bluetooth . It does have a headphone output but wired only . Yes , I can get a Bluetooth adapter to fit the 3.5 mm headphone jack but today Bluetooth is pretty common. < br />< br /> Overall we 're highly pleased with our purchase and would surely do it again.vice having to navigate by relying on the small screen located in the radio .

The Sangean ANT-60 antenna is good for what it is and performs as it should . One came packed with my excellent Sangean ATS-909X multiband radio . What is it ? ANT-60 is a 23 ' random wire antenna that reels into a spool like a measuring tape . That makes it easy to pack and carry around . It has a 3.5mm plug that fits into the external antenna socket on many portable shortwave radios . This plug is the same as a 1 / 8 &# 34 ; mono audio plug available as an electronics part from electronics stores like Radio Shack . The ANT-60 includes an alligator clip adaptor that allows the user to connect the ANT-60 center plug pin to the whip antenna of radios that do not feature an external 3.5mm-1 / 8 &# 34 ; antenna jack . ANT-60 also includes a strap and clip for hanging the far end of the antenna . ANT-60 is nice as a portable antenna for temporary setups . I pack mine when traveling or when using the radio on the boat . A random wire antenna will provide useful signal gain over a built-in telescopic whip SW antenna if the wire is long enough for the frequency to be received . The ANT-60 is long enough to provide excellent gain for SW frequencies over 12.0 MHz . For frequencies lower than that do n't expect quite as much gain . For an example from my location nnear the US west coast , Radio Australia at 17.840 MHz late afternoons and evenings comes in two or three times stronger with ANT-60 compared to using the built-in whip antenna on the Sangean ATS-909X . But , listening to Radio Havana Cuba during the evening at the lower frequency of 6.100 MHz may only be 50 % to two times stronger with ANT-60 compared to the whip antenna . The ANT-60 does n't do quite as well at lower frequencies due to it 's relatively short length . The built-in ferrite bar antennas found on most multi-band portables will do a better job for AM band ( MW ) radio which is much lower in frequency than SW . ANT-60 works best with SW . The ANT-60 antenna should be hung horizontally and as high off the ground as convenient . Six to eightfeet off the ground will do fine . The direction is n't that critical at this low height off the ground . No need to string it up tightly , a little sag in the wire wo n't hurt . Random wire antennas work best if you use them outdoors . They can work well inside wooden framed houses . You can also use a random wire antenna indoors by running most of the wire outdoors through a window or doorway . ANT-60 may be purchased for under $ 15 and sometimes for under $ 10 . Keep in mind that for $ 25 you can buy 75 ' or more of 18 gauge insulated copper wire , a 1 / 8 &# 34 ; mono audio plug and some mounting hardware and have a permanent random wire antenna that will run circles around the ANT-60 at all SW frequencies down to 3.0 MHz and maybe below that . I use a 120 ' random wire at home mounted eight feet off the ground . That antenna rocks . Keep in mind that quite a few user / reviewers and blog reviewers of short wave gear do not understand shortwave radio very well . SW reception is always better with outdoor antennas . Areas located in &# 34 ; the boonies &# 34 ; often offer the best reception of all because they are located away from electronic devices that cause RFI ( radio frequency interference ) with shortwave receivers . Those new to shortwave may also not understand that certain times of day offer better shortwave reception than others and that most shortwave bands work better at certain times of day than others . Inexpensive portable shortwave radios priced under $ 150 are likely to offer performance that is limited , at best . Cheap radios often rely too much on amplified antenna gain from a whip antenna and may overload if a longer external antenna like ANT-60 is attached . For well-designed shortwave radios ( portable or tabletop ) the ANT-60 will work better than a built-in whip antenna . The reel-up feature is a nice convenience .#### #### ####[([336], [335], 'POS')]

I 've owned 3 different types of Bose in-ear headphones , ranging in price from 100.00 to $ 150.00 , I love everything Bose , but I 'm hear to tell you , these Zipbuds are all you 'll ever need . And they 're 35 bucks . My challenge to the brand shoppers like me , the next time your 100.00 plus headphones go down , do yourself a favor and try these . They fit well , they really are &# 34 ; no tangle &# 34 ; , the zip concept is great , and of course the most important part , the sound ... the dynamics are very good . The base thumps , and honestly , the mid range to highs are better than the Bose . Heck I can get 3 pairs of these and get change back or 1 pair of the Bose .

Cable looks , works , and functions great . It 's a little stiff though . I knew going in that it would be more stiff being braided cables , but it is quite a bit more stiff than I anticipated , which is mainly an issue behind the TV where I want to make a couple bends to keep the wire hidden . I will eventually put HDMI through my walls and just use this as a spare long cable as needed for connecting a laptop , setting a TV outside , and other temporary uses. < br />< br /> UPDATE - I increased my review from 4 to 5 stars because really the cables are great and very rugged , which is why they may not be as flexible as other cables . Also after leaving a nice professional review I was contacted by the company to thank me for the review and I really like to see a company go that extra mile and listen to the feedback they are getting . That in itself would be worth a 6 / 5 star rating if I could .#### #### ####[([0], [7], 'POS'), ([0], [118], 'POS'), ([3], [7], 'POS'), ([6], [7], 'POS'), ([116], [7], 'POS'), ([0, 1], [7], 'POS'), ([1], [7], 'POS'), ([1], [118], 'POS')]
The sound is VERY good & for a little speaker , It is the best I 've heard from anything this small and is worth buying .

Purchased this due to the high amazon reviews . This is my third Onkyo receiver . For the first few weeks , I was impressed , lots of HDMI inputs , good sound quality , etc . Approximately one month after owning , I would get intermittent video drop outs lasting 1-2 seconds . This happened maybe once every hours . Not a huge deal . Fast forawrd to 6 months and am now getting these every 5 seconds , each time lasting for 1-2 seconds . Ca n't watch anything due to this issue. < br />< br /> I tried changing cables , changing inputs and even trying it on a small TV . Nothing seems to work . Called Onkyo who told me to take it to a local repair shop . After a week at the shop , I find out that this is not covered under warranty as I had purchased it from Focus Camera ( resller on amazon ) and not amazon.com. < br />< br /> I now have a 40 lb paperweight that I need to replace .

These work great for storing photo CDs at the back of my scrapbooks . The backing is easy to peel off and the adhesive sticks well to the surface but does n't grab on so quickly that you have to be quick to position it . I had hoped to find a bundle of 50 but it was worth getting the 100 pcs because they work exactly how I had hoped .#### #### ####[([23], [24, 25], 'POS'), ([15], [2], 'POS'), ([15], [17], 'POS')]
Just as the title states , this is an awesome wireless speaker ! This product is tinier than expected and measures 2.5 &# 34 ; wide by 2 &# 34 ; tall . Here are the features this speaker can do below . This product also contains a charging / Line-in cord and a handy little velvet bag for safe traveling. < br />< br />* Bluetooth pairing to listen to music ( Both Pandora and Spotify worked flawless for me , as well as music downloaded onto my phone )< br />* Hands Free calling via Bluetooth < br />* Play music via the microSD card ( Supports up to 64GB )< br />* FM Tuner ( Another feature that worked perfect for me )< br />* Music via Line-in mode < br />* NFC pairing ( Did n't work for me , see below )< br />< br /> These are a ton of features that are available for this speaker . Everything worked well beyond my expectation minus the NFC pairing . For some reason , I could n't pair my phone to the speaker using NFC . It could have been the phone case I 'm using , but I did n't make too much effort to try and get it working . I prefer bluetooth over NFC anyways , so this was n't a big deal . I 'm confident if I contacted the support people , they could have fixed my problem. < br />< br /> Some other cool features I like are the semi-sticky surface on the bottom of the speaker . This will definitely help against slipping away . Also , I like the way the volume / tuner work . A quick press to the left / right will change the FM station , Pandora song , ( or other streaming song ) , while a long press will lower the volume. < br />< br /> Overall , this wireless speaker is one of the best speakers I 've bought . Do n't let it 's small size deter you . The sound quality is way much better than I expected . What are you waiting for ? If you 're looking for a small and amazing wireless speaker , I highly recommend this one !< br />< br /> Although I did n't use it , NUVUO seems to have a great return policy : We pride ourselves with our Guaranteed 100 % Customer Satisfaction .

The ECHOGEAR TV wall mount is an outstanding product ! Right out of the box it was obvious that this is a well-made product . The parts are heavy-duty and everything is well-labeled . The directions are easy to follow . You do n't need many tools : a stud finder , a drill , screwdriver , and hammer will do it . Once it 's up , the way you watch TV will be changed ! You can move it horizontally , closer or farther from the wall , and tilt the TV . This is a definite 5 star product .#### #### ####[([35], [37], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [7], 'POS')]

Excellent wall mount at a great price . The only thing to me that held it back from a 5-star was the quality of the mounting screws .

These headphones are good for the price . I was n't expecting much but it has decent sound quality . however if you are listening for a couple hours the headphones can hurt your ears .

Not too happy with this speaker , I love the features but the sound is n't anywhere near what I expected it to sound like , it is almost a muffled sound because I do not feel the bass is that clear and distorting the treble . I tried two of them , so I am sure it is the quality . Compared to my mini jambox , it has nowhere near the bass - in fact I ca n't really hear bass coming from it , just noise . I think this is one of the main reasons I am not happy with the purchase . It does not have much bass and advertised as having a sub , so figures it would have a little more ummmmfffff ... .#### #### ####[([10], [30], 'NEG'), ([10], [14, 15], 'NEG'), ([10], [70], 'NEG'), ([10], [109], 'NEG'), ([38], [14, 15], 'NEG'), ([38], [35], 'NEG'), ([38], [43], 'NEG'), ([38], [70], 'NEG'), ([38], [109], 'NEG')]

After the other Sony receivers I had this one comes off as being really cheap feeling . The features are ok , set up was easy and for a while it worked pretty good . The down side is only 6 months I have already had to send in for repair , something went wrong and all I could get is hissing sound form the speakers . The customer service department at Sony just plain sucks . Dealing with people that keep putting you on hold so they can read a manual and walk you through a procedure before they will tell you where to get it repaired at is ludicrous . But after all that I sent it off , just got it back this past week and hooked it up . After one day we are back to square one .

These plugs work very well for the price . I am no audiophile but I do like to get the most of my entertainment system . Up until buying these , I was simply screwing the wires directly to the back of my receiver .

The Bluetooth receiver is utter rubbish . Even with an upgraded antenna the range is only a few feet .

I 'm very happy with this purchase . I read a lot of reviews on these before making my decision , and I decided to go with this option for future expandability . Set up was great , and really easy , and it works well with all of my devices . I 've only been using it for about 2 weeks now , but I have n't had any issues . The only thing that I would point out is that when I was going through the setup process , the onscreen guide would go completely blank after a certain amount of time . I 'm not sure if it was because of the receiver or my TV , but hitting the input button on the remote would make it pop back up .#### #### ####[([92, 93], [45], 'POS'), ([92, 93], [97], 'POS')]

UPDATE 2 ! Got through to them on the toll free number . No questions asked -- they are sending me a new pair . These guys are good . Update -- Now I get to check out the warranty . The jack broke on the headphones -- special note do n't put your phone in your pocket . I will let you know how it works out . The toll free number got re-directed to some 4404665800 . That is scary -- so I had to send an email -- what could go wrong . Hopefully , everything will work out . My SnuggBud PUMP'D headphones developed a short @ the jack - so I went on a search for new headphones because I am too lazy solder on another jack and I was n't going to spend another $ 50 . I scoured Amazon for reviews and saw the four stars on the Symphonized . I looked @ Symphonized NRGs . I read about others and kept coming back to the Symphonized NRG . The bar for bass was set really high after using the SnuggBuds . They rattled my head on the low end . I Kept reading and looking then I decided to go for it and I ordered the Symphonized NRG then waited . When they arrived I pulled them out of the box and pulled up youtube and hit play . Not bad but not perfect . I changed the rubber bits for something bigger -- still not right -- good but they could be better . Since I was n't using the SnuggBuds any more , I pulled the rub bits off them and put them on the NRGs . Magic happened , the bass was almost as good as the others but the frequency range was better on the NRGs . The NRGs had a wider range REally god bass , descent mid-range and the high were crisp . Plus for $ 15 bucks , the NRGs were a 1 / 3 of the price and really good sounds for me . I like great deals and this was it . Since my lovely wife signed us up for a marathon , I thought I would try the NRGs out on a run . I did a 5k run and only adjusted them twice . They shut out the world just fine . You wo n't be disappointed for the price these rock - quite literally .#### #### ####[([42], [43], 'POS'), ([42], [109], 'POS'), ([42], [325], 'POS'), ([112], [43], 'POS'), ([246, 247], [304], 'POS'), ([246, 247], [43], 'POS'), ([246, 247], [109], 'POS'), ([246, 247], [250], 'POS'), ([291], [295], 'POS'), ([291], [345], 'POS'), ([317], [183], 'POS'), ([317], [345], 'POS')]

Apparently our daughter is going through some sort of deaf-wish phase . Listening to music or the TV or really anything that she 's interested in must be cranked to 11 for her to be happy or she complains &# 34 ; I ca n't HEAR !&# 34 ; ( we 've had her hearing tested - it 's fine , for real !) . So when we were going on a road-trip I was hesitant to buy headphones so she could listen to What Does the Fox Say on repeat for 10 hours at a time without my sanity going out the window because I was sure she would end up damaging her hearing for good. < br />< br /> Enter these headphones ... with awesome volume limiting abilities ! To add to their allure for her , they were PINK ! So we were both happy . She got to listen to her favorite songs of all time , and I got to know that she was n't going to end up with hearing aides at the ripe old age of 10 ( plus , no Ylvis for me ! )#### #### ####[([114], [59], 'POS'), ([114], [112], 'POS'), ([128, 129], [127], 'POS')]

I bought 2 of these cables for rooms with ceiling mounted projectors with Dell T3500 computers . The cables were to long for the video signal to be processed by the projector , a Dell HD1610 . I do n't believe it was a problem with the projectors or the computers , I have 2 complete systems in 2 different rooms and neither one would sync properly . I gave the product 2 stars , &# 34 ; I do n't like it &# 34 ; , because I believe they should have worked at that length . I also believe that a better quality cable of that length would have worked . I have a commercial AV background and have used Monster cables of this length with no problem , again the timeless statement &# 34 ; You get what you pay for &# 34 ; .

This cable works great-for a couple of months . I bought it in May , now in August , I 'm only hearing sound in one of my speakers . I bought this cable I do n't want to be a higher price than some of the cheaper cables , like the one I had before this cable , which was giving me the same problem as this cable nowadays . I felt like this was of higher quality , but maybe not . This cable did not last as long as the cheaper cable that I had prior to it . I imagine there might be better cables out there .

I bought these to replace a pair of earphones that my lovely cats chewed up one night . I wanted something that was at least decent and not too expensive .

Thick , crisp sound , but the voice prompts are way too loud in the mix . That the voice prompt feature actually cuts the music for a full second to announce : &# 34 ; MAXIMUM VOLUME &# 34 ; is hokey design . Who would want that ? However , you can use a pin key to toggle between the voice prompt languages : English , Spanish , French , Portuguese , and tone ( unspoken ) . I have mine set to &# 34 ; tone &# 34 ; as it is by far the least intrusive . The voice prompts / tones should have a mute option . Edit Dec 2015 : I 've had this for 4 months now , and have downgraded my rating to 3 stars . The power-on , power-off and bluetooth alerts are so ridiculously loud ( and bassy !) , that they seem to be degrading the speaker ! I call that planned obsolescence . Shameful . Now when I turn it on ( which my downstairs neighbor car hear every time !) there is a developing crackle in the speaker . I never play anything louder than the alerts ! A very nice speaker almost ruined by very strange design choices .

It 's okay . Case insert slip feels like it 's ready to go at any time , build quality and fabrication of case itself is questionable , no QA done to make sure the cases you 're getting do n't already have gouges in the slips or damage / scratching on the case , but at this point , if you 're looking for this at this price , you probably do n't even care .

UPDATE Feb.1 , 2016 The headphones still sound and work great but 1 nagging problem you should be aware of , the headphone cups click and rub against the plastic pivots . This clicking sound makes its way into the earphone cup making a distracting noise . I took away 2 stars because I think its a design defect that distracts from an otherwise good performing Bluetooth headset . It only clicks if your adjusting your headphones on your head so it 's not constant but this could be a deal breaker for some . For the price I paid , sound quality and lightweight compact size , I live with it . Also , my commute is so loud on public transportation the clicks and rubbing noise do n't bother me as much as it should . Original Review : I bought these for commuting , they are lightweight fold flat and have great sound for wireless . These are not noise cancelling but do a decent job of cutting out ambient noise from the outside . Many different sites have mixed reviews for this headphone but for the price they met all of my qualifications . They are comfortable to wear because they do n't weigh much and they fit on my ears without clamping down on my head . The band is stainless steel and plastic , I do n't expect this to last forever but if they get me 1 year of daily use I have no problems at this price point . The Bluetooth connection is solid and pairs quickly , I cannot tell the difference between the wired or wireless functions on the head phones . They charge up through a standard micro USB port so it 's super convenient . Yes , there are better sounding headphones and Yes they feel a little more plastic than I like but the quality is great for what you pay . If you want convenience , lightweight and great sound then you should consider these .#### #### ####[([155], [154], 'NEU'), ([155], [332], 'NEU'), ([40, 41], [44], 'NEU'), ([40, 41], [261], 'NEU')]

I was hesitant to review these speakers because I am very fond of the Dayton replacements that I bought in the past and the glowing reviews that were already posted . My expectations were high and initially I was let down by this product . The price was right of course but there was no wow factor . However after breaking them in for an extended time and tweaking my amplifier settings a little I am happy to report that these little guys sound pretty darn good . Do n't expect them to be amazing right out of the box but give them a little time to warm up and you may be pleasantly surprised . For their price , size , and quality I expect out of Dayton I would say buy these !#### #### ####[([71], [68], 'POS')]

I noticed a small piece of solder stuck in one of the slotted mounting holes during the initial inspection , which fell into the power strip when I tried to removed it . The bit of solder can create a short circuit and therefore is an electrical hazard. < br />< br /> Fortunately , disassembly of the power strip to remove the piece was straightforward . Nothing was spring loaded and jumped into the abyss-of-small parts . Also , none of the solder joints on the PCB were noticeably bad ( although not great either ) . I suspect that excess solder from one the terminals broke off when the case installed .#### #### ####[([87], [65], 'NEU'), ([13, 14], [90], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], [90], 'NEU'), ([41], [90], 'NEU'), ([58, 59], [65], 'NEU'), ([83, 84], [90], 'NEU')]

This product is AWESOME , especially if you do n't have a lot of outlets . The useful thing about this is that you can turn the outlets on and off .

The cord is long enough to reach my bed and the usb chargers are useful for when i charge my phone . I also like the spacing of the outlets so I can connect my mac charger without worrying about it being in the way of the other outlets ; a common problem with strip outlets .

The device did split over the air digital TV signals however I experienced a 20 % loss of signal in each of the 8 ports . For example first I tested a TV directly to the antenna without splitting and it registered a 70 % signal . After splitting 8 ways it registered only a 50 % signal . This 20 % signal loss was consistent in all 8 ports . So I opted to go with an amplified splitter instead . With the amplified splitter I experienced 0 % signal loss but the price was $ 34. < br />< br /> Bottom line is you wo n't get a better device at this price point so if you start out with a strong enough signal ( i.e. 80-100 %) you can lose 20 % and still have 60-80 % signal strength and still have a good digital picture . Some of my TV 's started out with only 50 % so after using this splitter I netted only 30 % which was not enough signal for a stable digital picture .#### #### ####[([18], [16], 'POS'), ([18], [174, 175], 'POS'), ([24], [16], 'POS')]

This unit replaced an earlier Tripp-Lite Model with a battery that lasted seven years . Could not replace the battery in the earlier model . This new model allows the owner to replace the battery . With a battery replacement every five to seven years , expect this unit to last longer than I do . The previous model operated perfectly . We have a stand-by emergency power generator that takes about 20 seconds to pick up the house load and kick-in . The previous model always carried the load in the interim with no interruption .

I bought these headphones 6 months ago . They 're awful. < br />< br />- Sound quality is terrible ; it 's &# 34 ; tinny &# 34 ; and not crisp . Even with &# 34 ; bass boost &# 34 ; on the iPhone turned on the sound quality still has very little backing. < br />- The battery life on mine has gone from 6 hours to about 40 minutes. < br />- If you sweat ( who does n't when they exercise ) and it gets into your ears they fall out VERY easily. < br />- If you 're a runner it 's even worse - having the controls on the right section of the ear weighs on the headphone and causes them to fall out easily. < br />- If the headphones get at all wet ( again , who does n't sweat while working out ?) the crackle and sometimes go haywire as the indicator light flashes red and blue in a random sequence. < br />< br /> In short : junk . Do n't waste your money .#### #### ####[([16, 17], [19], 'NEG'), ([50, 51], [55], 'NEG'), ([50, 51], [32], 'NEG'), ([50, 51], [95, 96], 'NEG'), ([50, 51], [130, 131], 'NEG'), ([162, 163], [55], 'NEG'), ([162, 163], [95, 96], 'NEG'), ([162, 163], [130, 131], 'NEG')]
Clear representation of Lows , Mids and Highs . Absolutely astonishing Bass without the Mids and highs being muddied . Solidly built , will last for years and years . Great looks without compromising functionality . Mic is Clear as a crystal . My one and only complaint ( the reason I only put four stars out of five ) is with the weight of the headphones there really needs to be more ( softer ) padding along the top of the headband . This only become uncomfortable at 1 hour + of listening . Every component ( upon complete tear-down and rebuild ) in these headphones is VERY high quality . Bottom Line ; You get exactly what you expect and more .#### #### ####[([36], [0], 'POS'), ([36], [20], 'POS'), ([7], [0], 'POS'), ([11], [30], 'POS'), ([11], [0], 'POS'), ([11], [10], 'POS'), ([21], [30], 'POS'), ([21], [0], 'POS'), ([21], [20], 'POS'), ([31], [30], 'POS'), ([63], [74], 'POS'), ([82], [0], 'POS'), ([82], [47], 'POS')]

This is a wireless speaker suitable for amplifying from a phone , ipod , computer , or other device . The speaker measures 9.5x4x2.75 ” and weighs just over 2 lbs . In the package , in addition to the speaker , you get an aux cable , a power transformer and cable ( 110-220V input ) , and a set of international power plugs including North American , European , and Middle Eastern , and several more , and an instruction booklet in many languages , including English , major European languages , Chinese , and Japanese ( 6 pages for each language ) . On one end of the speaker are sockets for power in ( for charging the internal battery ) , USB power out ( for charging devices ) , and aux ( for connecting devices that do not have Bluetooth ) . Also on this end are a set of LED battery indicator lights and a battery check ( status ) button . On the top of the speaker are push button controls for volume up / down , play / pause , answer phone , and power . The top of the speaker also has a built in microphone for using the speaker as a speaker phone . The speaker is designed to be water resistant ; that is , it can withstand splashes or gentle rain , but it cannot be submersed in water . Once the internal battery is charged ( 4-6 hours for a complete charge ) , it can run up to 18 hours . It can also be used to charge an external device such as a phone . The speaker can connect to a sound source ( phone , iPod , computer ) either wirelessly through Bluetooth or with a wired connection using the included aux cable . The speaker can also be paired with a second Braven speaker for stereo output. < br />< br /> This is the external speaker that I have been looking for – it has a powerful , high quality sound , in a small portable package . The capabilities of the speaker are amazing , though . Not only can it run without being plugged in to an electric outlet , but you can even use it to charge your phone while you are listening to music . Or using the speaker as a speaker phone for a telephone conversation . The controls on the top of the speaker are easy to reach and manipulate — no trying to find a tiny dial to turn with your fingernail to control volume or power , for instance . I also found pairing the speaker to my phone to be quite straightforward . Overall , I have found this speaker to be provide excellent sound as well as phenomenal versatility . It would be a great choice for a dorm room , kitchen , cafe , home office , even living room , and it will also travel well ( especially with all those international plugs ). aker are easy to reach and manipulate — no trying to find a tiny dial to turn with your fingernail to control volume or power , for instance .

We needed to bridge our internet piped in sound via a PC to the sound system running our large entertainment center . We tried various PC 's with different sound cards and a couple different USB based DACs and were n't impressed . All added coloration to some extent and sounded artificial . Given the sound processors on the front end of our building wide amplifiers have onboard DACs ( good ones ) it eventually dawned on us to simply link the PC to the processors via SPDIF and let the rack do the conversion native with it 's higher quality DACs . Problem is coax SPDIF out is increasingly hard to find on PCs , but the Muse solved the problem nicely . Unit detected in both Windows 7 and XP automatically and works flawlessly . It 's also solidly built with a metal case . I 'm not one to believe in all the jitter nonsense and that SPDIF conversions have different subjective sound characteristics . All that matters is having a solid , commercial / professional DAC and getting the data stream there . The Muse did this without fault .#### #### ####[([29, 30], [70], 'POS'), ([106], [51], 'POS'), ([106], [70], 'POS'), ([106], [110], 'POS'), ([106], [135], 'POS')]

I purchased 3 of these to extend an HDMI signal through a 4 way splitter to a projector and 2 flat screens . The projector was probably a 65 ' run , one flat panel was ~ 100 ' and the other about 40 ' . Of the three , they all seemed to work well but I did get a lot of RF that interfered with my wireless mics . If I pulled power to the extenders , no interference , plug them back in , the interference would come back . I was able to overcome it for the most part with antenna placement and other adjustments . Another issue I had was that the Signal LED did not light correctly on one unit . I swapped it with one of the other units but the LED still did not function where the LED on the other unit worked correctly in both locations . But the unit itself , other than the LED , seemed to function okay . About two months after installation I received a call saying that the image in the projector was flickering . After a lot of troubleshooting I found that two of these units had failed . J-Tech was very good about reimbursing me for replacement units and the replacement units have been working correctly for a month . I 'll update if I have further issues . I could not find a single cable solution ( cat 5e ) that offered more bang for the buck .#### #### ####[([164], [55], 'POS')]

Pretty Awesome for its size , does n't have massive bass but come on what do you expect ? this little thing does however , get pretty loud , use power amp app on your phone and you get pretty good sound ! have n't tested the battery life to see if advertised is accurate but I am happy to carry this along when I go out for the day and know I have a nice option to play music at a louder and better sound than my phone , without draining the battery life of my phone so quickly ,#### #### ####[([4], [40], 'POS'), ([4], [84], 'POS'), ([10], [9], 'POS'), ([30, 31], [9], 'POS'), ([41], [40], 'POS'), ([41], [84], 'POS')]
Took this on vacation - and played it all the time . Surprisingly good sound for such a compact device . As a life-long audiophile , I am heavily invested in not liking Bose . Re-thinking that position right now . Highly recommended .#### #### ####[([14], [13], 'POS')]

The XSBOOM is performing as I 'd hoped it would . I 'm using it to play satellite radio and as a hands free device for my phone . It 's small size fits where I want it to and still gives me the performance I need . It 's portability is great and works like a champ . Sound quality , even at high volumes , is very good ; not tinny or raspy . I would recommend this piece of gear for someone who wants to take a speaker with them but does n't want it to take up very much space . The only negative comment I have is that if it is paired with my phone and I leave the car , it does n't automatically pair up again when I return . You have to cycle power in order for it to re-sync ( or I 'm missing something ) . Other than that , a super speaker and a great deal .#### #### ####[([1], [78], 'POS'), ([32], [31], 'POS'), ([50], [52], 'POS'), ([50], [78], 'POS'), ([59, 60], [69], 'POS'), ([59, 60], [72], 'POS'), ([59, 60], [74], 'POS')]

After about a month of use , this tiny , yet powerful , bluetooth transmitter is the perfect device to transform non-bluetooth devices unto one . At first look and upon unboxing , I was somewhat disappointed and thought this tiny little device would not meet my need to transform my Samsung 40 &# 34 ; Smart TV unto a blutooth unit so I can pair it with my bluetooth headphones . The first week was phenomenal so I thought I would give it a couple more weeks of heavy use to really test this transmitter 's capabilities and endurance . Not only did it pass with flying colors , it also surpassed my initial discrimination ( the popular notion that one should not judge a book by its cover definitely implies to this ).< br />< br /> To power the device , I attached the included USB to MicroUSB chord unto one of my TV 's USB slots for constant power ( device powers on when the TV is turned on ) .

The speaker turned out to be sturdier than I thought it was going to be . I work as a landscaper and needed something durable that had also loud and clear sound . The Evizian delivers with a deep bass that carries a rich resonate sound combined with clear highs . The music carries well up to 100 ft .

This saves me a lot of time in the morning . Either I absentmindedly leave my keys wherever I first wandered into the house or they are in the bottom of my purse . Now I can just click the button and know whether to keep searching my purse or track it through the house . Unfortunately , my husband wo n't use a keychain because he hates when they clank against the key fob and add extra bulk . This is unfortunate because it 's expensive when he loses them . It would be nice if the stick-on finders were 1 / 4 the size or less and much thinner because then I might convince him to use these on his key fobs and remote controls . Also it would be nice if they could all be either a sticker or a keychain in case the purchaser favors one over the other .

Buyer beware : This is a model with a fixed cartridge and no tracking force adjustment . That means it may have troubles tracking properly , especially on the newer 180g vinyl . It may ( or may not ) skip on some 180g records . Your guess is as good as mine as to which 180g LP will turn problematic . This is a huge drawback , but it is a result of a cheap built ( and a low price ) . It does a decent job on the older LPs . The only advice an owner of LP60-USB will get from Audio-technica is ... to buy a more expensive AT model ( AT-LP120-USB or the AT-LP1240-USB ) . LP120-USB is priced at 430 CAD on the Bestbuy.ca . I will not go into detail on the stop button problems . If it stops working one day , you will have to open the turntable and manually adjust the levers . It is not difficult to do , though. < br />< br /> http :// answers.audio-technica.com / answers / 1213-en _ us / product / 085561cf849acaa9 / at-lp60-usb-lp-to-digital-recording-system-questions-answers / questions.htm ? expandquestion = 268802 < br />< br /> Do I recommend this turntable ?

These are extremely comfortable Headphones . Not very heavy , which further adds to the comfort rating . The sound quality is more &# 34 ; open &# 34 ; and more detailed than the AmazonBasics On-Ear Headphones . I compared these with the AmazonBasic On-Ear Headphones ( regular ) and here are my findings : + The Premium headphones have more bass presence . + Slightly more &# 34 ; detail &# 34 ; and cleaner sounds . For example , I can hear the &# 34 ; hammer attack noise sound &# 34 ; from my Casio px160 when playing sforzando , while I could not with the regular headphones . I can also hear more subtle lines in the music when there are many instruments overlapping . + Sound is more open , not as &# 34 ; stuffy or boxy. &# 34 ; + Better build quality - feels more solid . These have a cover on the soft material for the top piece . The ear cushions are softer and a bit larger . + Surprisingly not as hot as the regular ones . Maybe because the cushion is made from a different material ? + Detachable cord ! . + Relatively light . + adds more &# 34 ; color &# 34 ; to the songs . So music sounds slightly better , probably because there is more presence in the lower end and higher end . - Cost about 2 - 3 times more . Overall , I these premium headphones are better than the regular headphones in terms of build quality , sound , and comfort . However , these do not sound not as good as the ATH m20x . Too bad the ATH m20x is too tight and too hot for me . I recommend these if you want a pair of comfortable earphones for casual listening and music enjoyment , but not for analytical listening or mixing . I am pretty certain these do not have a &# 34 ; flat &# 34 ; frequency response curve and are not as detail as professional headphones . Hope this is helpful for people deciding between the AmazonBasic regular headphones and the premium ones .#### #### ####[([171], [177], 'POS'), ([171], [76], 'POS'), ([171], [173], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [154], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [26], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [148], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [259], 'POS'), ([77], [76], 'POS')]

Anker is top notch . I might look at cell batteries next . All cables that have had the anker name has been top quality .

I ordered this product because my new 55 &# 34 ; TV came with legs on the side instead on a stand attached to the middle of the unit. < br /> Before the Swivel TV Stand 's arrival I was worried about how stable this stand was going to be holding my tv and placed top of the shelf I have reserved for it . After putting the thing together I realized it was far superior to any standard TV stand . Not only was it sturdy , but it looks and works fantastically . I saw some reviews on here where people complained about the 30 degree swivel seeming a little too short for their liking , but I have no idea why they would want it to turn anymore - its perfect the way it is. < br />< br /> Sometimes people fail to realize that Amazon does not make or own everything they sell . I had a question about installation and I was answered back almost instantly and in a person matter . It 's nice not to talk to a computer and be treated like a human being in 2015. < br />< br /> When I upgrade to a wall mount or need speakers , I will be buying from this company again . Not even a question .#### #### ####[([46], [94], 'POS'), ([93], [94], 'POS'), ([109], [114], 'POS'), ([91], [94], 'POS')]
This cable is very well made and seems like it will last for quite some time . It was definitely a plus to have the EZ Grip Caps on the ends of the cable . They make screwing and unscrewing the ends into the jack very simple , fast , and easy .

The cables work fine and the price is right , but one of the cable 's connectors did pop loose after removing it a couple of times from the receiver .

This is a nicely designed bluetooth speaker about 50 % taller than a soda can with roughly the same diameter . It has cushions that allow it to sit in either the vertical or horizontal configuration with all controls accessible in either setting . The Bluetooth setup works quite nicely : I configured my iPhone to connect to it . Thereafter , when the speaker is turned on , it automatically links correctly with the iPhone . If you take the phone out of range , then back into range , it reconnects correctly . The speaker will play whatever you play on the linked device : music , telephone call , whatever ....< br />< br /> The unit comes with a bag for easy portability of the speaker , a mini-to-mini cable that can be used instead of Bluetooth connectivity , and a micro-USB cable for charging the internal battery of the speaker . The manual does not contain any information about the battery , and the speaker has no obvious method for battery replacement . Presumably , the speaker is meant to last only as long as the battery lasts. < br />< br /> The downside of the speaker is , unfortunately , the sound quality . I found the sound to be somewhat muffled , as if the treble were turned all the way down , for both music playback and for telephone calls . Calls are intelligible , but I prefer the sound on the iPhone 's built-in speaker . The benefit of the Lenovo speaker is that it 's somewhat more powerful than the built-in speaker of the iPhone , so the volume goes up more and you could use this in the middle of a meeting or with a group of people to a better extent than the phone by itself . But overall , I 'd want a better quality speaker within a device this size before making the choice to use this rather than just using the phone .#### #### ####[([5, 6], [125], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [3], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], [317], 'NEU'), ([45, 46], [49], 'NEU'), ([253, 254], [49], 'NEU'), ([253, 254], [268], 'NEU')]
This receiver is excellent ! I have just been using some cheap speakers I had laying around , so I 'm sure the quality will be better when I finally get some good ones . However , what I CAN say is that the sound output is plenty loud ! Also , there are like 7 HDMI inputs on the back , so you can get all your components hooked up with HDMI . I only have a Kodi box and Xbox One on mine , but it 's really nice . The remote is very sturdy . Setup was also a breeze ( be sure and turn your tv on since that 's where the setup menu will show ... took me a bit to figure that out . hehe ).< br /> I like this receiver so much that I recommended it to my father in law , whose receiver was so old it did n't even HAVE HDMI . So , we updated his system and hooked everything up with HDMI , which sounds ( and looks ) a lot better than his old RGB connections . It also has an optical audio port , which is nice .#### #### ####[([44, 45], [96], 'POS'), ([44, 45], [102], 'POS'), ([44, 45], [183], 'POS'), ([93], [3], 'POS'), ([93], [96], 'POS'), ([93], [183], 'POS'), ([98], [96], 'POS'), ([98], [102], 'POS')]

These Monster Turbine High Performance Earbuds are hands-down the best I 've ever heard ( still ) and better than most over-ear headphones - and after I 'd tried about 10 different Top-Rated brands at the Minneapolis Airport ( other Monsters , Klipsh Image S-4s , Bose , etc ) I ordered the Turbines . Fantastic ! Full-thumping clear bass and kick drums , and clear mids and highs without distortion even at high levels . Presence ! Instrument placement as the music producers and engineers designed . Truly amazing . I also got them with Control Talk and I got them for an amazing price drop on Amazon one day - price jumped back up the very next day . Got some decent use out of my buds - then the cat ate through the cord ! So with this model cancelled , I ordered their Diesel models - fantastic , too . I preferred these Turbines slightly better overall ( only slightly ) but the Diesels have a sturdier build .

I bought a pair of these as they were highly praised in several reviews as the best under $ 20 . Which really is saying that out of all the crappy earphones out there these may be the least crappy. < br /> These were intended to replace the original earphones that came with my iPhone . The reviews led me to believe these will be superior to Apple 's . What a disappointment ! The sound is so terribly poor ! No definition , no clarity in either highs or lows !

This is a great little device but note that even if there is nothing hooked up on the 6 volt side the converter still draws a few milliamps ; not enough be an issue with a car battery , assuming you do n't leave your car parking for months on end without running it , but if you are supplying the 12 volts with a smaller capacity battery and you do n't charge the battery that often it can run down the battery . But I was impressed with the ability of the device to continue to deliver 6 volts even when the battery was nearly dead and putting out only 7 or 8 volts rather than 12 .#### #### ####[([82], [87], 'POS')]

BE SURE TO INSTALL CORRECTLY . Let me say that again . This MUST be installed in the correct direction for it to work properly .

From 38 to 77 channels ... When my brother first recommended the Mohu to me , I was extremely skeptical . I have tried many other powered and non-powered antennas . I was in shocked - aghast disbelief - when the scan completed ! Channels I had never heard of 40-60 miles away . And I sit just one mile away from Sutro Tower on Twin Peaks in San Francisco . I ca n't wait until I take some serious time to re-scan and adjust the Mohu 's height and location in my home . I replaced a $ 19 RCA antenna from Target that I have used for years . I am eager to see how the Mohu tolerates changes in wind , direction , and the fog all of which contributed to pixelated and non-existent / lost signals day-in , day-out . T H A N K Y O U ! 6 STARS !

It did not work when I put it in the garage door opener so it must not have had a full charge . It worked the next day and a week after when the power went out. < br /> Shipped out and got it fast .

When I moved I was dismayed to find out that the cable was on a wall that I cannot imagine putting a TV on . This was a perfect solution as I pinned the cable along the carpet and then ran it along where tile meets carpet . I hid the cords for safety with this product .

Works mostly as advertised . I have been using it for a couple days now and it is doing what i need it to . I have an autistic son and his mother needs to be able to monitor the school bus because if he gets dropped off early and no one is there to pick him up he will wander away . I used this device today to monitor his bus all the way from his pickup to his drop off at school , and back in the afternoon. < br />< br /> I was going to use the speed monitor to get alerted when he was on the bus and moving but tech support tells me that feature does not work . But that 's ok because the geo-fencing feature is actually better . you can set up any number of zones and it will email or text you when the transmitter enters or leaves those zones. that part works , so i got a text when the bus left the school. < br />< br /> I do not believe the battery is going to last 2 weeks between charges , based on what i have seen so far . But if it makes it through 5 school days and his mom can recharge it on the weekend , then that is fine. < br />< br /> P.S . We put the transmitter in his backpack , that seems to work fine .#### #### ####[([101, 102], [122, 123], 'POS'), ([101, 102], [135], 'POS'), ([101, 102], [246], 'POS'), ([131, 132], [135], 'POS'), ([237], [246], 'POS')]

I was very happy with replacement battery . We have already used our Kindle probably 30 hours since installing battery and everything works fine .

Love these headphones for watching moves on my computer ! Talk about big sound ! They completely block out everything else around you and allow you to focus on the presentation . I think that I should put out there that I do n't have great natural hearing . These really help bring out the nuances that I am sure I miss with other earbuds and such . Due to my hearing issues , I have never been a huge audiophile . These may turn me around . SoundTrue is the absolute definition of truth in advertising ! I love the way that the cords completely detach from the headphones allowing for other options in cords ( maybe other headphones have that feature , but this is my first such pair ) . These also lay nice and flat in their high quality case . I feel like they would be super secure when traveling , no problem . The earbud revolution seemed to make over-the-head headphones a thing of the past … but I 'm glad that revolution is over and a new one is at hand ! Bose knocks it out of the park . I love these and look forward to using them for years to come !#### #### ####[([13], [141], 'POS'), ([47], [45], 'POS'), ([47], [136], 'POS'), ([143], [136], 'POS'), ([143], [141], 'POS')]

Purchased this UPS to replace a very old APC unit ( APC Back-UPS Pro 650 ) . The Back-UPS Pro BR1300G has greater capacity and additional features , such as the LCD screen status display which shows battery state , load , and voltage.Also , the battery installation / removal is easier than with the old unit. < br />< br /> At first , this unit produced a noticeable acrid odor like burning plastic ; evidently , this is not uncommon with a newly installed UPS .

These are terrible headphones and I plan to return them . I 've had these for a month and purchased them to work out ( ski erg and in door rowing ) . The sound quality is fine and my experience is the plastic ear wrap , which should secure the headphone in your ear . If you are using these while exercising and jar around too much , the headphone rom my ear dislodges . The ear wrap does not secure the headphone in your ear . If this happens , then you will need to stop and not only insert the headphone in your ear but you 'll also need to adjust the ear wrap . It 's impossible to stick the ear piece back into your ear without adjusting the ear wrap .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'NEG'), ([44, 45], [43], 'NEG'), ([44, 45], [120], 'NEG'), ([44, 45], [49], 'NEG')]

I would have given it 5 stars except there is no option to charge without a USB port .. that 's not a big deal because most phone chargers have USB plug ports on their wall plug charger anyway .

Basically , other than volume Control and power I have to use the phone / app controls. < br /> I 'm using an android and the manufacturer states in their literature that because of the amount and variety of android software available it is difficult to make all features Work on all devices. < br /> HOWEVER ... .

This is a good surge protector at a very reaonable price . It is n't too large and does not interfere with my other outlet in the same box . The lights are uselful to tell if it is operating properly . While it is not too large for most uses , this surge protector , like any other direct plug in protector , will extend from the outlet enough to make it a tight squeeze if you have it installed directly behind a piece of furniture .

This is my first bluetooth speaker. < br /> Sound Quality : Definitely loud and clear . The bass was tight . But did not sound boomy . I wanted to &# 34 ; feel &# 34 ; the bass . I did not expect much. < br /> Build : The enclosure was plastic with metallic grill on the front . The buttons sit on top . It actually controls the phone . I did not have to unlock < br /> the screen to change the music . Definitely a must have . They started something here that will make it almost a necessity from now on for < br /> lazy people like me. < br /> Battery longevity : Why in the world would i want to stay plugged . So yeah , definitely a plus . It 's rated battery life is well above average. < br /> Size : While not a matter for most people , it is definitely something that i look for when buying . It both limits the capability of the speaker < br /> but also is a compromise between portability and sound . Just because it 's small does not mean it sounds bad . It actually is just the right < br /> size . It also has just the right volume. < br /> Overall : I would give it a perfect score if i could feel the bass . It 's definitely there but i have to be 3 feet away or less and reduce the volume < br /> so that my ears do n't bleed just to feel the bass .#### #### ####[([216], [212], 'POS'), ([216], [13], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [212], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [13], 'POS'), ([18], [20], 'POS')]

My love affair with Eneloops began after coming across them at Costco . They have performed fantastic and I use them for all my game controllers , mice , flashlights , and everything else that uses batteries . The low self discharge and the amount of times that you can recharge them ( up to 500 according to product page ) make them a fantastic choice for use in emergency situations . I recommend picking up a better charger for your rechargeable batteries such as the La Crosse Technology BC1000 Alpha Power Battery Charger to ensure you get the most life out of them .#### #### ####[([40, 41], [39], 'POS')]

They sounded great for the price , but even though I do n't have a particularly big head I found the clamp extremely strong and unlike other headphones they did n't really loosen over time . What did happen is the plastic began to crack near the slider so I had to have them replaced . The pads of course were extremely comfortable , if you have a small head or like a firm clamp then they are definitely worth your time .#### #### ####[([21], [23], 'NEU'), ([21], [62], 'NEU'), ([5], [2], 'NEU'), ([41], [44], 'NEU'), ([41], [54], 'NEU'), ([47], [44], 'NEU'), ([57], [23], 'NEU'), ([57], [62], 'NEU')]

For many many years I have depend on my iPhone to wake me up with the alarm . I have purchased quite a few generic alarm clocks never quite happy with them so I figured my phone is on the table next to my bed so I will just use that . I purchased this iHome iBT29BC Bluetooth Color Changing Alarm Clock and really do like it . The light looks really neat fading in and out but it can be turned off . I knew I could not sleep with the light so I set mine to stay off . However when the alarm is programed the light can be programed to come on with the alarm . I really like this as it helps me wake up . By the way there are two alarm settings ( and yes a snooze ) . Over all I can not think what would make this a better alarm clock as it does everything it is deigned to do and it had Bluetooth so you can wake up to whatever music you like !#### #### ####[([69], [72], 'POS')]

Very Good Clock radio . I have had mine for about a month. < br /> I bought this to replace my old gen1 iHome radio alarm clock. < br /> Positives : dual alarms for week days and week ends or any other day you like , blue tooth and aux jack for Iphone / ipod and other mp3 players , and several dimming levels for the clock face including off . I personally like my room very dark when i sleep so i have the display at its lowest setting before its off . I wake up to the radio and its set to slowing increase volume up to my own specified value . You can adjust whether you want it to slowly increase volume and how lowed it can get . The sound quality is also very good. < br /> So far the time keeping has been very good . my old iHome would loose time about a minute or 2 every month. < br /> Negatives : first hunting for your favorite radio station and making it stick is not the easiest thing in the world . I with it have a dial type control . But once its set up you should never need to change it . Second the 2 alarm off buttons are right next to each other so i almost always hit the wrong one first . My final negative is the height of the alarm clock itself . Its relatively tall next to my bed making it harder to hit to turn off or hit snooze . Not a huge issue but I would prefer a shorter version . It is a little expensive but worth the price. < br /> All that said this is the best radio alarm clock i could find on the market that had sound rise technology , a very dim-able display , a FM radio , and dual alarms .#### #### ####[([51, 52], [64], 'POS')]
Just know that it might not include the hardware you need ! I assumed it would and mounting my TV required me to take my TV to Lowes to find the right hardware for my application ( Pretty typical 42 inch Samsung TV , I thought ) . Besides that it seems fine ! Decent quality , includes most of the things you need . Nice HDMI Cable that 'd probably cost at least 15 bucks from Best Buy ( lol ripoff ) anyways . Have to torque down every bolt and didnt include an allen key though , so if you dont own alot of tools know you might be picking some up while you 're at your local hardware store getting the right hardware ! Update : So after I posted this review the company CONTACTED ME and immediately , without questions or hassle refunded me fully for the product without the need for a return . Customer service from Cheetah Mounts will stand behind their product 100 % . Because they took the time to call me and refund me without any hassle I have changed my review from a 3 star to a golden 5 star review . The product is indeed a good product , I was just surprised to see more hardware was n't included !#### #### ####[([55], [54], 'POS'), ([66, 67], [65], 'POS')]

Noise-cancellation is pretty good -- Bose is still the best . The size of these headphones is ideal for the minimalist traveler -- this was really important to me in my decision . They are much more compact than any other over-ear headphone that I have seen on the market . They are small ear cups but still fit comfortably over the ears and are quite comfortable even during longer flights . They are not the loudest headphones in the world . I listen to them at 95-100 % volume most of the time so the battery life is 5-6 hours . Fortunately , Sennheiser made it easy to swap out battery packs ($ 25-35 / ea ) . Battery packs can also be recharged without being connected to the headphones . Sound quality is great and have a rich tone . But again , they are not a very loud headphone . I do not see a big difference in sound quality between these and the Wireless Momentum 2.0 . The MM 550-X are much lighter and compact than the Momentum line . One , last thing -- these bluetooth headphones do not pair well with non-Apple products . I am pretty restricted to using them with my iPhone , although you can still use the supplied wire to connect to other brands of tablets and PCs . I am very satisfied with this purchase .#### #### ####[([0], [3], 'POS'), ([0], [17], 'POS'), ([0], [59], 'POS'), ([0], [135], 'POS'), ([5], [3], 'POS'), ([5], [9], 'POS'), ([5], [59], 'POS'), ([5], [139], 'POS'), ([12], [3], 'POS'), ([12], [17], 'POS'), ([12], [59], 'POS'), ([12], [135], 'POS'), ([54, 55], [53], 'POS'), ([132, 133], [17], 'POS'), ([132, 133], [135], 'POS'), ([140], [139], 'POS'), ([161, 162], [3], 'POS'), ([161, 162], [17], 'POS'), ([161, 162], [59], 'POS'), ([161, 162], [135], 'POS'), ([190, 191], [53], 'POS')]

In my house we go through batteries like crazy so we decided to switch over to using rechargeable ones . I know this will save me a lot of money every year. < br /> I ordered the AAA 8 pack of batteries and I am very impressed with the quality. < br />< br /> I use a lot of AAA batteries for my electric pedicure file and I was buying them from the discount store . I was surprised at how much more power these had than the discount batteries . My devices seemed to work a lot better and the pedicure file was so much stronger. < br />< br /> I love how eco friendly rechargeable batteries are . I recycle anything and everything possible so I know I am doing my part by using these. < br />< br /> These batteries can be recharged 1000 times which is very impressive . Just buying one pack of these is saving me so much money. < br />** This product was received at no cost for review and inspection purposes , No compensation for a positive review was provided .

As headphones , these are compact and fairly comfortable , although over a longer time , they press on my tragus -- YMMV on that , since I imagine it is the shape of my tragus more than the headset . Tried placing a call and the mic is n't good -- the person I called could n't hear me at all . Since I bought them more for use as headphones , that 's not a big loss for me but it could be a problem if you planning on using them to place calls .

I have had this product for about a little longer than a year , and it worked great for where I worked . I lifeguard at an indoor pool and it gets quite humid in there so I needed a product that has good loud sound and could deal with the humidity inside that area , so I bought this . Instantly I fell in love with it . It played clear and the bass was decent too . I would not say it was the best , but it got the job done very well . Everyday I would listen to music through that device as I lifeguarded the pool . It was worthwhile for that speaker and it played quality music . So , now you may be wondering why I have three stars on it . Well , today as I was guarding my speaker was playing , and it was still playing well , but it was running out of battery so I was charging it , I then noticed the charging was only working somewhat-I had to position the charger in the port for the device to charge . I initially thought it was not a big deal as products do tend to wear over time . It is inevitable . So , after I was done listening to music through this speaker , I went to go charge it again , and as I was positioning the charger so this device would charge , the charger port popped right out . Man , was I disappointed . I thought I got a one in a thousand speakers that had a faulty charger port , but I was wrong . Upon further investigation I found that there were quite a few that experienced the same problem , except it happened to them within the first few times using it. < br />< br /> So , my advice is this : If you want to take the gamble that you may possibly receive a speaker that has the possibility of the charger port falling out within the next few days , to the next few years , then that is all on you . I would say purchasing this product was nice and it was good while it lasted , so i believe the gamble was worth it on my part . However , will I buy this product again ? Most likely not . If this broke after 5 years of use , I would have bought another one in a heartbeat , but in this case it broke after about a year . If you have the money to throw around , go ahead and get this speaker . It is loud , plays greatly , battery life lasts long , it is rugged and waterproof ( as my coworkers have accidentally dropped it on the ground and in the pool . ) It is also compact and it has a nice design . But if you plan to choose really carefully , you may want to think twice before purchasing this product , for it is a gamble as to how long your usb charger port will last .#### #### ####[([278], [498], 'NEU')]
So I thought it had stopped working . But I think what happened was the part that connects to the capsule when you charge it is a bit hard to push in all the way because a tiny piece of plastic sticks out a bit and gets in the way -- it 's as if the part you push in sometimes does not go all the way in and so it does n't charge and just goes dead . ( The red / blue charging light does n't come on ) . You have to just keep trying and eventually it comes back and charges .#### #### ####[([15], [28], 'NEU'), ([15], [86, 87], 'NEU'), ([84, 85], [28], 'NEU'), ([84, 85], [86, 87], 'NEU')]

This box works very well as a replacement for the Z-2300 control pod . I have n't had any issues with it other than being a bit disappointed in it 's construction - especially for how expensive it is . The entire thing ( except for the knobs ) is pretty cheap plastic and the knobs actually pull right off if you pull straight up . To give you an idea of how light this thing is , the end of a single VGA cable that plugs in to the back of this box is heavier than the box itself . This can make it difficult to keep it on one place on your desk - especially if the box is close to the edge and the cable is hanging down off the edge . The cable might pull the box right off your desk . I 'm almost tempted to glue some small weights to the inside of this box .#### #### ####[([47], [51], 'POS'), ([31], [51], 'POS'), ([31], [27], 'POS'), ([31], [105], 'POS'), ([55], [95], 'POS')]

I used these to add plugs to my old KLH-6 speakers .

Purchased for my technology inept best buddy for his birthday . He always had me make him cd 's with different music on them . I picked this up as I had an 8 gig microsd just lying around so was able to load all his hits on there with room to spare . Volume , forward , back , on , off . That 's all he needs , and that class took me a little while to explain to him ... Great sound and great package and price point . Thanx much .#### #### ####[([84], [83], 'POS'), ([87], [86], 'POS')]
I love the speaker . I just HATE the ' the bluetooth is ready , the blueetooth is connected as successfully ' notification is SUPER loud and cannot be adjusted , other than that it 's got great sound , loud speaker with bass . Lights up . I actually have mine plugged into a bathroom outlet to give it a night light and also have some tunes while I get ready . Cool product , also bought as gift 4 times over , and the recipients love the speaker as well. < br />< br /> I use it mostly for bluetooth // but also has FM Radio // Aux In // Memory Card reader . -- I have tried all and they work well .#### #### ####[([11], [125], 'POS'), ([16], [125], 'POS'), ([38], [37], 'POS'), ([41], [40], 'POS'), ([41], [87], 'POS')]
Did the job and not mad at it but definitely get what u pay for . The screws u get ca n't be trusted really too risky for me I went to a dept store . Also the screws for studs are exactly 16 &# 34 ; apart no leeway maybe just under 16 &# 34 ; so at first I did n't think it would fit into both studs but it just made it . 3.5 stars , would buy again ( if free return is an option )#### #### ####[([17], [26], 'NEU')]
They ship really fast despite is from China ( just 4 days )< br /> The product in my opinion is really good , it works just out of the box ( I used for about 5 hours without batteries problem ) . Easy and quick connection < br /> This small speaker is pretty loud and the sound is good ( Is not a Boom Bass speaker it just has 2 inch diameter approximately , 3w x 2 ) , another features are :< br /> Micro SD card slot , Stereo , Aux Input , Radio FM , works for hands-free phone calls . And the price id perfect …! !#### #### ####[([46], [45], 'POS'), ([52], [60], 'POS'), ([58], [60], 'POS'), ([108], [45], 'POS'), ([108], [60], 'POS'), ([108], [110], 'POS'), ([92], [45], 'POS')]
So far the battery life is great . Lasts through two 12-hour shifts and then some without charging in-between . Loading music on was a cinch . Only complaints are these : the lock function . When I go to unlock it , I have to press the button a total of three times to unlock it . The first click shows the lock but the second click relocks it ! Pretty annoying . And while I have it locked and with it in my pocket , God forbid I lean against something that presses the buttons ( still not sure if there 's a specific combo ) it turns the player off ! Other minor things are it does not save your place after you turn it off . It seems to always go to the same random song when I turn it back on . The last-used volume setting also does not hold . These things I can live with and will likely purchase another one just for my car .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [6], 'POS'), ([33, 34], [28], 'POS'), ([33, 34], [72], 'POS'), ([33, 34], [153, 154], 'POS')]

Very compact and has a nice overall look . It feels quite sturdy too . Connecting to my bluetooth was instantaneous and hassle-free . I was immediately able to get the speakers up and running within minutes .

recently purchased this item and plugged it in to test the power supply . The red led light came on indicating that the unit was getting power .

I routinely recommend & purchase for friends !!! ! Sound quality far superior to any BEATS , and for a fraction of their ignorantly bloated price . Only negatives to be mentioned is the remote only works with iOS devices , & no 3.5mm low-profile angled plug . Needed a replacement cable after 2 years due to this , of which are easily found here on Amazon ! Sennheiser 's Amazon shop also sells a cable for these with Android remote functionality , & a 3.5mm low-profile angled plug ; but it 's a crop shoot whether it will work on your Android device ( though they are guaranteed compatible with all Samsung devices such as the ever popular Galaxy & Note ) . Great set of cans that truly do get better with age !! ! PEACE#### #### ####[([9, 10], [12], 'POS')]

After purchasing the SHARKK BOOMBOX speaker I was offered this product complimentary in exchange for providing an honest review . I find this WATERPROOF speaker similar to the BOOMBOX with a few improvements in design . The WATERPROOF speaker comes in the same minimal packaging as its predecessor . Included are the wall charger / USB link cable ; AUX cable ; and carrying bag . This speaker has a rubber casing with a nice feel . 3 LED lights on the side show battery level and two lights on top show Bluetooth status . Setup and pairing are easy , and the same as the BOOMBOX . As with the SHARKK BOOMBOX , this speaker doles out very nice sound with ample bass and clear mids and highs . Bluetooth connectivity is nice , but can be glitchy at times . Twice , the power button has not worked and the unit has been &# 34 ; stuck &# 34 ; . Bluetooth did not function when speaker was &# 34 ; stuck &# 34 ; . Eventually , speaker regained normal operation . I guess what most people are interested in is whether this puppy is WATERPROOF . I subjected this speaker to a sprinkle test , or about 1 minute under the shower head to simulate leaving the speaker in the rain . I then submerged the speaker in 1 foot of water to simulate dropping the speaker in a pool or leaving the speaker on the beach . In both cases the speaker was powered on and playing music . Music play was uninterrupted for both tests and physically the speaker was unharmed . I feel comfortable claiming that this speaker lives up to its name WATERPROOF ! Also , it floats . CONCLUSION : Expect some made-in-china-electronic glitches , but the problems are minimal and ultimately the build quality and sound are excellent for the price .#### #### ####[([64], [74], 'POS'), ([64], [99], 'POS'), ([64], [125], 'POS'), ([64], [267], 'POS'), ([64], [276], 'POS'), ([64], [317], 'POS'), ([34], [32], 'POS'), ([34], [99], 'POS'), ([34], [125], 'POS'), ([55, 56], [99], 'POS'), ([55, 56], [133], 'POS'), ([59, 60], [99], 'POS'), ([59, 60], [133], 'POS'), ([52, 53], [99], 'POS'), ([52, 53], [133], 'POS'), ([63, 64], [99], 'POS')]

We love Bluetooth speakers in our house , my family uses them daily !< br />< br /> This speaker was a tad smaller than I thought it would be from the pictures but that ’s okay with me , being compact means I can set it up just about anywhere . A great feature that I found out after I got it in is that you can prop the speaker vertical or horizontal , looks fantastic either way. < br />< br /> You can listen to the radio or connect the Bluetooth up with your tablet or phone . The LED color light show has 3 settings : Blinks by in a pattern , bumps along to the music or completely off . The volume gets pretty load and the sound is crisp and clear. < br />< br /> I am overall happy with this LED light show speaker !< br />< br /> I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and fair review which I have provided .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [1], 'POS'), ([2, 3], [145], 'POS'), ([19], [23], 'POS'), ([19], [76], 'POS')]

Nice and secure and lots of holes in wall side so ai could find wood studs behind for secure mounting. < br /> The only heads up is you will need a long phillips screw driver to tighten up the screws which lock the vertical bars onto the horizontal wall bar after the TV is mounted on the vertical bars. < br /> Once it is screwed up tight I can confidently tilt it with no concerns about pulling it off . I am sure it would hold up even during an earthquake. < br /> We have it on a 55 inch LG and it is rock solid .#### #### ####[([40], [37], 'POS')]

Okay , they are basic headsets that are not super tough . But for $ 29.95 they are fantastic . Have used them in the gym for about 6-8 months now . Use them in the garage working on my motorcycle or car . Use them when my wife is trying to sleep and I want to listen to videos on my tablet. < br />< br /> I wear hearing aids . In the gym , I either had to wear my hearing aids and not listen to music , or I had to listen to music with ear plug and shut myself off from others . These allow me to listen to music with good sound quality AND hear what people are saying to me . I can wear them over my hearing aids without feedback . You can replay songs , skip forward , skip backwards , change the volume and take phone calls ( not the best feature of this product. . but it works )< br />< br /> Battery lasts for several days at the gym or one day in the garage . Fast charging . For $ 29.95 this is a great deal !#### #### ####[([5], [18], 'POS'), ([161], [160], 'POS'), ([161], [189], 'POS'), ([117, 118], [18], 'POS'), ([117, 118], [116], 'POS')]

Great product .

Great rechargeable batteries ! ! I have been using rechargeable batteries for a while now and recently switched to the Amazon Basics brand of them. . One thing I have noticed , these are normally just repackaged ( And wrapped ) name brand batteries costing much less than the big brands ( Sanyo , Ect ) These batteries work just as well. . They last just as long. . They charge just as quick ! ! I have also noticed they are always accurate on their mAH ratings. .< br />< br /> Amazon basics is now my new brand of rechargeable batteries and they are now all I order !< br />< br /> Tips :< br /> 1 . ) These batteries cost more but end up saving hundreds of dollars a year !!< br /> 2 . ) Make sure you have a good quality charger to go with these batteries. . It makes them last longer. .< br /> 3. ) Mark your batteries and keep them together. . If you have a remote that takes 4 batteries ALWAYS keep those 4 batteries together. . When it comes to rechargeable batteries one battery can be your weakest link ! Keep them together and on the same charge cycle and they will last MUCH MUCH longer#### #### ####[([70], [73], 'POS'), ([148], [73], 'POS')]

I 'm writing this reviews for those that are concerned these might not be factory replacements. < br />< br /> A few reviewers said they are not . And the cheaper versions do n't fit or block noise as well as original. < br />< br /> Well the black pleather in mine finally came apart . I found these in amazon , read the reviews and then went to Bose , on Bose website they were $ 35 and free 7 day shipping . I just replaced them , they snap in . Super easy . Looks as good as new . Based on the reviews this product sounds just like what I got from the factory . Small box , two earpads , two scrims ( cloth speaker grill ) , and instructions on glossy magazine type paper . Bottom line , if you are worried go direct to Bose . Just have to wait longer. < br />< br /> Is $ 35 a lot , yes . But the headphones were pricey too . OEM car parts cost more too , especially if you have a luxury mobile .#### #### ####[([50, 51], [55, 56], 'NEU')]

I really think these are a steal ! The bass is really accurate . The mids sound way better than you 'd dream you 'd hear for the price . The highs sparkle without simbilance ( OMG I hate that sound ) . For the money they 're pretty good . Ok ... quite excellent . The 1-star deduction is for the cord . It 's so easy to tangle and tangle it does like no other . A flat and thicker cable would have been nice . If it had better cables I 'd say these would be a steal at 3x the price , and for the asking price now , I suggest you buy at least 2 pair , because if your first pair died , you 'd miss these terribly . As for the review that said these are overpriced , I would have to say that I agreed if I lived in a cardboard box under an overpass !

Does the job and is more than half the price of what you would find at a place like say Fry 's electronics . The thing I love about this product is that it 's not just a stubby adapter but is a short cable . Why is this important one my ask ? Well if you 're like me and have a laptop like the original Yoga Pro , you will notice that the mini-HDMI port is right next to one of two USB 3.0 ports . If you already have a mini-HDMI to HDMI ( or whatever else output type ) cable then you will notice that the USB port is still accessible . However , if you 're trying to use an adapter for a HDMI to HDMI output , a stubby adapter will block this USB port access . Hence , this cable adapter , in my opinion , is the perfect fit for any of those out there with the same predicament I previously mentioned .#### #### ####[([9], [155], 'POS'), ([75, 76], [114], 'POS'), ([75, 76], [155], 'POS')]

This cable served me well for months . It is flexible with a rubberized coating that gives it a much more quality feel than the usual stiff plastic coated cables . My only complaint with it was that the silver caps at the base of the cable tip screwed off too easily and I was often tightening them back up . There was no risk of them getting lost , it was just a slight annoyance. < br />< br /> In the end , one of the cable tips bent beyond repair when the device it was plugged into slid off a car seat at a sudden stop .

After reading a few reviews on this and watching the video demonstration , I decided to go forward with the purchase and locate it in a low traffic area ( against a wall ) . For that reason , I cannot vouch for how well it will stand up to heavy foot traffic , but it does stay in place very well without anyone bothering it. < br />< br /> The color match against my wood floors was n't as close as I was hoping it would be , but it still looks pretty good . I decided to just feed a single cord from my power strip through the cover , and it does n't seem that it would have closed with much more underneath of it . But to be fair , I did not actually test that out. < br />< br /> The reason I 've docked this product 1 star is the black rubber base . It draws quite a bit of attention to the fact that I 'm trying to HIDE wires . I knew the base was black before purchasing , and I 'm still pleased with this product .

This is exactly what my setup with missing , and it 's so nice to not have to have more than one remote sitting out .

I do n't get all these good reviews . I listen to music all day long . I cut grass for a living . Have for 20 years . I always have earbuds in . I go to the gym . Have for 10 years . I always have earbuds in . I do work around the house . Again , always have earbuds in . I know my earbuds . These are terrible . They sound so muddy . There 's almost no high end . Tried treble boost on my Iphone 6 plus , still terrible . Tried bass reducer and Rock , still terrible . I listened to a podcast of First Take and Lil Wayne was on it . I could n't understand what he was saying because his voice is so deep and monotone that it was basically distorted . I listened to rock and hip hop and I still hate , hate , hate these earbuds . I do n't know how they had 48 reviews at the time I bought it and all were 4 to 5 stars . You have to be kidding me . And these earbuds are not broken . They just are awful sounding . I 've been buying Skullcandy with the built in mic because they are cheap and sound great especially at high volumes , but as I said , they 're cheap and the mic stops working after about a month and a half because I use them so much . So I figured let me try and find a better quality earbud so I do n't have to keep buying new ones . Well these are very well made , as far as feel . I have used them long enough to know if they break but I 'll just keep buying my old earbuds and just keep these as a backup till a new pair comes when an old pair goes . They 're only 9.99 so I did n't even both getting my money back but I just had to write this review because all the great reviews about these earbuds and NO bad reviews ? Something smells fishy . At least sounds fishy !#### #### ####[([88, 89], [73], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [97], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [106], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [143], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [239, 240], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [365], 'NEG'), ([100, 101], [106], 'NEG')]

Great sound , nice strong cord , right angle plug is very convenient . Microphone is a little close to the earpiece and I 'm seeming to have trouble disconnecting a call with one click .

Here in rainy Seattle air signals can be spotty during weather . Because I do n't have a window facing known TV towers , the best reception I get is with this antenna facing the exact opposite direction . ( Must be picking up the signal bouncing off nearby buildings ) . To do this I do n't tape the antenna to the window. < br />< br /> Considering my location , in hindsight I wish I would have bought one with a built in amplifier . ( With a separate plug to a power outlet. )< br />< br /> I am a fan of AmazonBasics , but I had to knock off one star because my neighbor is in the same boat as me , virtually same location , and does n't get the same random spotty reception from their similar antenna of a different brand .#### #### ####[([5], [8], 'POS'), ([5], [139], 'POS')]
I really like this antennae . Instantly during the channel scan , different channels were being picked up . Thanks !#### #### ####[([4], [2], 'POS')]
The headset itself is something different : The box showed an orange headset,and it came out to be blue . I think it 's random colors , so it 's cool to see what you get . Notes : Turn volume down , then crank back up . I played a movie on a laptop and nearly shot to the roof like at cat . So recap : excellent sound quality , non-compatiblility with ps3 systems and xbox360 systems due to wiring . As a PC headset , it 's pretty good .#### #### ####[([1], [24], 'POS'), ([25], [24], 'POS'), ([69, 70], [68], 'POS')]

Love , love , love this speaker . Bought it to listen to an outdoor movie that broadcasted the sound via FM radio . It worked great . It was loud and clear .

We purchased a set of these for use in our wireless mics at church . They were fantastic ! We got very predictable performance from them every week . The slimline size fit our Shure and Line 6 devices very well . We recently noticed some premature low battery warnings , so we decided to replace the batteries . After checking our records , I confirmed we had purchased these batteries in December of 2013 . We got about 20 months of great service out of them . The Ansmann products ( both these AA and several 9V batteries as well ) have been a solid investment for our church that has helped us save money compared to buying alkaline batteries in bulk every few months .#### #### ####[([23], [17], 'POS'), ([23], [82], 'POS')]

this lil speakers is cool it fits in a cup holder it get good sound it has good range so you can walk away from it and still be able to hear your music with out it cutting out .... . If you have your phone with you. . it comes with a lil clip thing so you can clip it to your belt loop on your pants or whatever. . one thing I do n't like about it and this might just be my phone but every time you turn it on you have to go into your phone and connect to it and sometimes it wont connect you will have to try to connect twice for it to work ... the battery life in this is good about 6 hours of play time before it turns off but then if you do n't wanna charge it you and hook up a aux cord and it will work without having to charge it. . overall this speaker is good#### #### ####[([2], [4], 'POS'), ([2], [13], 'POS'), ([14], [13], 'POS')]
[[ VIDEOID : ef77de1944821e6355956b8f8a98fe2 ]] I have worked with a lot of Bluetooth speakers and have learned quite a bit about the different variations between them . Specifically I have paid close attention to the sound profile , and the current trend is to overdrive the bass and neglect the midrange . This little speaker by iGadgitz does a good job with the sound profile . It has a unique appearance too which makes this a most interesting little speaker. < br />< br /> The most obvious feature of this speaker is of course the physical design . It looks a lot like the top of a professional microphone complete with screen and dampener . I have always thought this look is old-fashioned and so I really like the appearance . The screen is more than just a decorative , though - it is strong and provides good protection for the speaker underneath. < br />< br /> When set to discoverable mode for pairing the speaker identifies itself as \\" Idol 2 \\" . I paired it to my phone and it paired and connected very quickly , less than 10 seconds . It was ready to go and I started streaming music to it. < br />< br /> This speaker has very god sound profile . The highs are bright and clear , no complaints there . The midrange is also very good and as a result the music has the right depth , neither sounding lifeless and hollow nor sounding like it is coming through a tunnel . The bass is a touch soft but not weak . The most important aspect of the sound profile is the midrange and I am encouraged that this speaker gets it right. < br />< br /> I picked up the speaker and walked away from the source . I found that the range is between 30 ' and 35 ' before it starts cutting out or stuttering , but if the base of the speaker is obstructed it starts cutting out a lot sooner . I reversed the process and carried the phone away from the speaker , and the range was the same - approximately 30 '.< br />< br /> Overall this is a nice speaker and I am pleased with it . Aside from the fact that it looks cool , it sounds very good and have better-than-average range . It 's a good choice if you are looking for a small speaker that looks and sounds good. < br />< br /> Disclaimer : I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair , honest and thorough review .

100 % worth it , every time . I 've been using these for the past three and a half years , and I just ordered my third pair . The sound is amazing , to the point where music from my MP3 player using different headphones sounds weird now . A little steep for earbuds , but it 's worth it . On both of the pairs I 've had before , one of the ear buds has stopped working after a while , but I mostly attribute that to all the abuse I put them through ( wires getting caught on stuff and pulling them out , cramming them into tight pockets , dropping my MP3 player and catching it by the headphones , etc. ) . Plus , two pairs have lasted me 3.5 years !

Amazing sounds . I returned these after feeling a bit guilty about it being too expensive , however , recently bought it again as I really miss the fantastic sound it offers . The sound just really pops and I especially enjoy the balance between the clarity and punchy bass .

Although I hope Sennheiser would make the ear pieces more secure as the ear buds accidentally fell out once or twice when I took them out from my jeans pockets .#### #### ####[([46], [41], 'POS'), ([34], [0], 'POS'), ([34], [37], 'POS'), ([49], [93, 94], 'POS'), ([84, 85], [41], 'POS'), ([84, 85], [87], 'POS'), ([90, 91], [93, 94], 'POS')]

This is the third of this type of converter I have owned , and is the best one so far because the audio does n't have an enormous amount of hum like the previous 2 did . I 'm giving it a 4 because the picture is mediocre , but that seems to be the case for all 3 HDMI to S-Video converters I have owned , so I 'm assuming that is the case with all of them at this price point , but if I was to spend more than this then I 'd just buy a new TV instead. < br />< br /> It does exactly what I need it to .#### #### ####[([22], [47], 'POS'), ([45], [47], 'POS')]

My son was getting ready and packed up for college last week and was stressed because his cord that he had gotten with his Dr. Dre Beats Headphones at Christmas had been chewed up by our puppy about 1 and 1 / 2 months ago . I had gotten him a replacement but it stopped working just about 2 weeks ago . His school is over 5 hours away so after ordering this replacement cord from Grapevine Cables last week he was really worried that he was n't going to get them in time before leaving for school . However , these arrived lightning quick and that made his day ( and mine ) . He would n't have known what to do without using his phone on the long ride to school . We chose the red ones and since I know nothing about them , I asked him what he thought . Construction wise he felt that they were quality made and he could tell the difference right away in the way these felt versus the ones we got a few weeks back . The wires and other pieces did n't feel flimsy at all . It pretty much does the exact same thing that his original cord did and he said he really could n't tell the difference as far as functionality and sound between these and the original . Thumbs up from us ! We received this product at a reduced price during a promotion in exchange for our honest and unbiased review .#### #### ####[([17], [54, 55], 'POS'), ([17], [194], 'POS')]

This thing sounds fantastic for movies and music. < br />< br /> Also , kudos to the seller for getting this 45 lb behemoth to me less than 24 hours after I ordered it !#### #### ####[([59], [64], 'POS'), ([59], [58], 'POS'), ([59], [76], 'POS'), ([15], [64], 'POS'), ([15], [17], 'POS'), ([15], [76], 'POS')]

This is probably the best thing ever made . This was purchased initially to be used for a karaoke set up , but found that it is going to be used and should be used for so much more . The sound is great , not to much bass , just good quality sound all around . Love that it is bluetooth capable and that you can use usb as well . The best part is that it has a rechargeable battery and can be plugged in , which allows you to use it anywhere . Not to heavy and sturdy handles . It also has wheels with an expandable handle so you can roll it if you need to take it very far . The microphone that came with it is not bad , but would recommend purchasing a better quality one . I bought two of the Shure SV100W mics and the whole system together sound awesome . Ca n't go wrong with this for the price . Love it !! !#### #### ####[([41], [43], 'POS'), ([41], [170], 'POS')]
Batteries did n't work at first , but when I removed the plastic off of one end , it worked fine . I guess the device I bought them for was n't a good fit for the battery design .

Works exactly as advertised at a reasonable price . I use it to run my RoKu to the TV but occasionally display my laptop with an HDMI cable . It does display the laptop when connected , and the RoKu when the laptop is n't connected. < br />< br /> Be advised that its status indicator LEDs are pretty bright in a dark room . This is n't necessarily a problem since the unit is automatic and can sit behind the rest of your A / V equipment . But if your requirement is that it 's visible you 'll need to cover the unit when you 're not using its manual capability .#### #### ####[([7], [6], 'POS'), ([55, 56], [60], 'POS')]
Since HDMI does n't have any positive retention mechanism ( like the screws of DVI or VGA ) , the fit is everything . These gender benders have the best fit I 've found .#### #### ####[([30], [29], 'POS'), ([20], [29], 'POS')]

The product was well made and probably works great for many people . However I am rating it based on our experience . We live in an area surrounded by mountains , with Phoenix , 2 hours away , being the closest place with Signal towers . When we hooked up this antenna , we only got a few channels and none were network ...... all were either religious , or home buying channels . I give the company 5 stars though for accepting returns within 30 days and the prompt refund .#### #### ####[([7], [8], 'NEG'), ([7], [90], 'NEG'), ([91], [8], 'NEG'), ([91], [90], 'NEG')]
It 's okay , I guess . The mp3 player that arrived in the mail was , in fact , shaped like a duck . However , it was not the same one as in the pictures . The one I did receive has no volume control whatsoever ( all of my songs play at full volume , which makes actually using the thing slightly painful after only about 2 or three minutes ) and has a weird red light on it that flashes whenever music is playing . The SD card wo n't go in without some tricky maneuvering ( I had to push it in with the screwdriver ) and , the thing has no internal storage . As far as the sound quality goes ... It 's not good . Lots of treble , no bass , and very tinny . And like a said before , there 's no way to change the volume , so I hope that you like listening to your music at full blast . For the price , I was n't expecting much , and that 's exactly what I got -- not much .#### #### ####[([135], [44], 'NEU'), ([135], [65], 'NEU'), ([135], [130, 131], 'NEU'), ([45, 46], [44], 'NEU'), ([45, 46], [98], 'NEU'), ([45, 46], [130, 131], 'NEU'), ([90, 91], [44], 'NEU'), ([90, 91], [98], 'NEU'), ([90, 91], [130, 131], 'NEU'), ([117, 118], [116], 'NEU'), ([124, 125], [44], 'NEU'), ([124, 125], [65], 'NEU'), ([124, 125], [98], 'NEU'), ([124, 125], [130, 131], 'NEU')]

Amps are n't supposed to make headphones sound &# 34 ; better &# 34 ; . Only louder . Sometimes that loudness can translate to hearing more sounds from the source , but it does n't do anything to the sound itself ( unless you choose the EQ options ).< br />< br /> I came in with this expectation , hoping to be pleasantly surprised by all of the good reviews , and I have to admit , I 'm rather disappointed . It 's not that the amp does n't work - it certainly does amplify the sound , but not by much . I 've never used it on any volume except max , and even then I find myself turning up my iPod or portable video game consoles to hear the sound more clearly . It only makes up for a few notches on the source volume slider , and that 's with the amp turned all the way up. < br />< br /> I do n't feel ripped off , but I do feel disappointed . At least the construction quality is good , and the battery life is ... okay . I usually get a few hours - maybe three ? It 's hard to tell when I do n't listen all at once . Charging it is simple. < br />< br /> All in all , I would 've felt much more satisfied if I had bought this at a $ 20 price point . It 's not bad , but do n't expect anything amazing . My Audio-Technica M50 headphones do n't have that high of an impedance , either - 38 ohms .#### #### ####[([186], [188], 'NEU'), ([0], [90, 91], 'NEU')]
I have Amazon Prime and these delivered after 4 days after ordering rather than the &# 34 ; guaranteed &# 34 ; two day shipping . The product itself is awesome . The quality is scary good , the item itself is easy to use and operate . The battery holds for a good amount of time without needing to be recharged . And even when it needs to be recharged it only takes a few hours . Overall a good product , the only thing that I could see being an issue is if you are a lefty and want to use the controls you would just need to switch ear buds but the L and R on each one will be wrong which is kind of annoying .#### #### ####[([33], [36], 'POS'), ([33], [42], 'POS')]
I love these things . They 're so comfortable and light and sound just as good as my larger cans-style headphones . Surprisingly &# 34 ; big &# 34 ; sounding with a decent soundstage and better separation than most cans ( at least the ones I 've tried ) . the impedance is a little low and they 're good and loud , but might not handle really loud volume as well as heavier-duty headphones . I do get a slight bass rattle at times. < br />< br /> Perfectly easy to lay down and listen before bed or at the desk at work , so i 've just been taking them back and forth . I like the way my SUPERLUX cans sound but they 're just so big and heavy that i 've been going solely with these and not missing the others at all .

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND : Initially worked great . Quick delivery and no issues . The cable was packaged very nicely and I was impressed by the quality , especially for the price . It seemed like a great deal , but see below . UPDATE : Cable has now permanently died . It was great while it worked . I believe the issue is that the strain relief is inadequate . I replaced the cable with one from the local store and everything is working fine now , so it was definitely a cable failure .

I got these through Amazons Vine Program and was impressed with them . Being &# 34 ; bone phones &# 34 ; makes them a little different , your music is n't as loud in your ears and you 're able to be aware of what 's around you more so than with regular headphones .

I got this speaker for my children to use while watching videos on my Kindle . The setup was very easy , and now with the speaker both kids can hear the videos perfectly . It is about 9 inches long ( see my photos ) , and it does have a flat strip on one side so that it wo n't roll away . The LCD display shows that the speaker has 15 volume levels . We have also tried the speaker with my phone ( Samsung Galaxy s4 ) , and it works fine as well . The price on this is reasonable / fair . It does n't have a lot of bells and whistles , but all I needed was a simple speaker with good volume options .

Did not work . Ordered this item previously for the other TV . The difference between the first and the second item was the shape of the receiver , the first ordered unit was a square shaped receiver the second had a teardrop shaped receiver . The teardrop shaped receiver does not work , either there is a frequency conflict with the remote or the receiver was defective . Ordered the just receiver item , ( square receiver head ) , ( Monoprice 5-Feet IR Extender Cable Receiver ( 108060 )) on a whim and connected it to the setup , worked flawlessly , no issues . Responded to Amazon and the seller of this issue , they told me I was connecting it backwards . So I sent their defective unit back for a refund , neither the seller nor Amazon would refund the shipping cost .

Onkyo works good . One quirk , as soon as I first turn it on to my Direct TV ( the cable / sat ) selection , the receiver within 30-40 seconds decides it wants to turn itself to the &# 34 ; TV &# 34 ; selection , thus cutting off my sound . I have to use the remote to switch back the Cable / sat selection , then it is fine . I am not sure what is causing this . Have not called techs about this yet . When the receiver gets turned on no matter where to Blue Ray player , satellite , Apple TV , or Roku it switches itself to the TV selection , then I have to use the Onkyo remote to turn it back to the proper selection , then it works fine . Anybody know what I am doing wrong , or what is causing this ?#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'POS'), ([28], [50, 51], 'POS'), ([53], [141], 'POS'), ([53], [2], 'POS')]

I have a motoryacht and needed a radio with speaker and bluetooth. . The electronics person said it would be about $ 1500.00 to install a radio and speakers . I found this speaker on amazon and I truly love this speaker . We have been way off shore and pick up radio stations and the quality of the speakers is very good . It gets loud enough and the blue tooth works very well . The battery stays charged at least 12 hours . I am leaving one speaker on the boat and ordering another one for my home soon .

I ca n't really say that I find this product useful , and I 've been organizing wiring for more years than I care to admit. < br />< br /> I purchased this item because it sounded good in theory . Being able to organize my cables sounded like a great idea but after reviewing this product I do n't think it is for me . Basically it is only box to hide my surge protector . The problem with even that though is that it is a pretty &# 34 ; loud &# 34 ; box . It has a pink cover and will stand out wherever you put it. < br />< br /> On the positive side it is a well made plastic box and if you design your set up around this item it could work well for you . It just does not seem to be that beneficial to me. < br />< br /> Like I said , this could be a decent solution for someone because it is made well but it just did n't turn out to be the right item for the objective that I had. < br />< br /> I received this product at a discounted rate for testing in exchange for a honest , fair review .#### #### ####[([75, 76], [79], 'NEU')]

I am an Olympic style weightlifter . It is important that these headphones not jumble around when I am putting heavy weights over head . They do just that . Only problem I have is the false advertising on the sound control box . The actual size is roughly triple . It looks super tacky and is a bit heavy . For this sole reason I will not buy again but that is just my personal preference . Great headphones otherwise .

I 've had this speaker for a week or so now and I really like it so far . I work 12 hour days and the battery really does last all day on the single charge as advertised . However , this is only the case if you do n't turn the volume up all the way like you would need to if you were working 12 hours on a factory floor like I do . It only lasted about 5 or 6 hours then .

Bought for my nieces birthday .

I purchased this to mount a 60 &# 34 ; LED Vizio tv . I paid to have it professionally installed using Amazon services . It was simple , perhaps a little more expensive than finding some one locally myself . The unit came almost completely unassembled . When I have bought these before , they were always assembled in the box . It took the tech about an hour to assemble the unit . Once installed , it was easy to swing the tv around , and did n't sag when fully extended . It would be a 5 star review if there was n't so much assembly involved .#### #### ####[([82], [80], 'POS')]

I really wanted to like this receiver , and when I first got it I did . The interface using the TV is great , the setup is painless , and there 's tons of options . However , I 've already had two units fail , the first would go into protection mode as soon as the volume went above 15 , the second one just had the HDMI output jack fail for no apparent reason after a month and a half of infrequent use . I really like Sony products in general , but the two lemons I 've had on this model has tarnished my opinion. < br />< br /> Now I have to try to get warranty repair work done because the unit failed outside the return policy for Amazon , which is frustrating to say the least on a unit that is n't even 2 months old yet .#### #### ####[([18], [23], 'NEG'), ([26], [28], 'NEG')]

A good pair of 18650 rechargeable batteries . The 18650 is becoming the standard battery choice for higher-Lumen flashlight makers , and they are still expensive compared with more common rechargeable AA and AAA sizes .

Really small and compact but does the job perfectly without hum or heat ! Worked straight out of the box and we use it in Central America to step up from 110v to 220v . My only slight disappointment is that the model I bought only handles up to 100 amps ( ie low capacity . Whilst small electric motors etc will be fine , anything of a heavier use could blow the fuse .

I received a free sample for review. < br />< br /> I wanted these cable drops to use in two places : my bedroom , and in my office . In both places I have cables which tend to slide off the surfaces easily. < br />< br /> On my nightstand in the bedroom , I have a long cable which I attach my phone or iPod to , when I 'm in bed . It tends to slide off when the device is n't attached and I 'm always looking to see where it fell . This solves that problem -- it keeps the cord exactly where it should be. < br />< br /> In the office I also have USB cables which seem to have minds of their own . They fall down behind my desk on a regular basis . I redecorated my office a few months ago in bright colors and the pink and orange fit in perfectly . They keep those cables orderly and on the desk where they belong. < br />< br /> I should note that these cable drops are of good size and can handle either a very narrow cable ( like a Lightning cable or USB ) or a heavier cord ( like a lamp cord , ethernet or power cable ) . Or , you could even get several narrow cables in each if you wanted to. < br />< br /> Such a simple thing , but they have saved me so much time hunting down fallen cables already . I wish I 'd had these long ago ! Life is too short to put up with wayward USB cables and cords. < br />< br /> I should also mention that they openings are wide enough to accommodate those flat , tape-style charging cables . ( See photo below. )< br />< br /> As mentioned above , I received a complimentary package of these for my review after use . But they are so useful I would have happily paid for them. < br />< br /> Update , April 2016 : I just used a few of these on the back of our TV to corral a few wayward cords . It looks much neater now . Now I 'm out of these and have them in my shopping cart to buy more .#### #### ####[([193], [192], 'POS')]

Quite a nice product. < br /> I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the earphones , the plastic is not as good of quality as the Apple earphones,which is quite disappointing seeing as the Apple earphones come with the product you buy from Apple and is not a separate purchase. < br />< br /> Although the sound quality is amazing and the earphones it self is quite light weight. < br />< br /> This is perfect for people looking for something cheap but with good sound quality and is also lite weight .#### #### ####[([17], [11], 'POS'), ([20], [11], 'POS'), ([20], [22, 23], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [63], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [89], 'POS'), ([66], [22, 23], 'POS'), ([90, 91], [11], 'POS'), ([90, 91], [63], 'POS'), ([90, 91], [89], 'POS')]

The speaker itself stuck to the wall and never fell . It SEEMED to handle being damp in the room and from time to time getting splashed on . The sound quality was great too . The problem currently being that the speaker just RANDOMLY would n't turn on after charging overnight . I ca n't seem to find warranty information or whom to contact , either . The buttons on the speaker seem to have swelled and / or become stuck . Not really sure what is wrong but I 'd love a replacement without having to spend money on a new one. < br />< br /> IF this company could get in touch with me that would be wonderful .

I bought this to make my home theater build look nice and clean . For the most part it has done this . I decided to forgo the terminal blocks as they seemed to be way too expensive for what they were ($ 12 each , and I would have needed 8 of them ) . Instead , I soldered the speaker wire I already had to the ends of the ghost wire . This worked out pretty well except for the heat from the melted solder deformed the white &# 34 ; outside &# 34 ; part of the wire . Not a huge deal as it was getting painted over anyway. < br />< br /> Overall , it looks nice . Not as clean as an in wall wiring job , but I did n't want to make more work for myself than absolutely necessary seeing how this was a DIY project .#### #### ####[([7], [10], 'POS'), ([7], [12], 'POS'), ([7], [122], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [85], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [87], 'POS')]

Bluetooth made easy for non bluetooth devices < br /> This device makes any non bluetooth speaker or headphones wireless . It has come in useful in many different ways , I connected my daughters' cheap headphones to it and they became wireless , the play / pause button worked fine with amazon instant video app , and she had fun playing a game where I was playing minecraft on her tablet and she was identifying the terrain I was walking on or through as she had the headphones on walking in the other room . It works well to make those old speakers you have laying around the house . It also was useful in the car , instead of fumbling around for your phone or tablet if you are listening to music , you have a nice big button to hit that will play and pause your media . If you hold the button down for a couple of seconds , it will trigger &# 34 ; OK Google &# 34 ; and you can do you google searches with your phone or tablet. < br />< br /> Cons : It did seem to hit and miss regarding the apps it supported , the main stream apps it was able to interact with , while other apps it would n't play or pause anything , so if you are going to be using any app with this that you need it to play or pause , I would test it before real world use . I did n't like 1 hour battery life I got out of it , and it wo n't work while charging . It took me about an hour to charge the device , if you could use it while charging it would be a great device . Overall , this is a good device .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'POS'), ([47, 48], [50], 'POS')]

I did n't pay attention to how big this was , so I was quite surprised when I opened the amazon box expecting a lunchbox sized speaker and instead found a cigarette pack sized speaker . However , when it charged up super fast , I hooked it to my iphone . The Bluetooth handshake was super smooth . And the sound it produced filled a very large room , and could be heard from nearby rooms . That was at max volume , but I ca n't see myself using anything else unless there was a party or something . The sound is clear , and the buttons simple and responsive . The sound does get a little shaky if you have your iphone in your pocket and move around the room , but it i is unclear whether this is the phone or the unit , though other speakers have not done it quite as noticably . That said , for the price , this is a great unit , and I would buy it again .#### #### ####[([53, 54], [57], 'POS'), ([53, 54], [109], 'POS'), ([53, 54], [111], 'POS'), ([53, 54], [119], 'POS'), ([102], [104], 'POS'), ([102], [169], 'POS')]

For the past five years or so I 've used Bose earbuds , but after another pair ripping in the same spot and becoming unusable , I decided it 's time to do some research and find a different pair of earbuds , hopefully cheaper than my former Bose pairs . I spent hours and hours reading lists of ' best earbuds' I found on the web and reading reviews here on Amazon . I finally decided to try these out as a pretty inexpensive headphone to use for daily listening and to wear at the gym . My first impression is that they were a little difficult to ' get in . ' Twisting them forward the right angle , and adjusting the memory wire behind the ears , I had to look in the mirror to get them in the right spot . These are more difficult to take in and out than other pairs I 've had , so I would n't recommend them if you need to pop them in and out frequently . The memory wire behind the ear also becomes uncomfortable after a short length of time . I have n't even been able to stand wearing these earbuds for the entire length of my workouts . I take them out halfway through because they start to hurt and the transfer noise I 'll mention next gets really annoying . The noise from the cords brushing against something ( microphonics I think it 's called from the review I read ?) is unbearable with these headphones . When I was researching before my purchase , I read reviews that mentioned this issue , but I had n't really understood what they were referring to as I never had this problem with my Bose earbuds . The cords of these earbuds are pretty stiff and seem like they would be tangle free but they always get tangled in my gym bag . I ca n't really attest to the sound of these because I 've listened to talk radio with them and could n't stand to wear them longer than that ! Have n't even tried them with music . I wish I had just purchased another pair of Bose instead of wasting the money on these !#### #### ####[([124, 125], [186], 'NEG'), ([124, 125], [234], 'NEG'), ([124, 125], [258], 'NEG'), ([124, 125], [308], 'NEG'), ([179, 180], [186], 'NEG'), ([179, 180], [234], 'NEG'), ([179, 180], [258], 'NEG')]

It works , but the instructions are virtually non-existent and the controls are clunky and not intuitive .

I love this speaker . I already own the Sharkk Boombox and have really enjoyed that product . The Sharkk 2o has taken an already great speaker and made it better . I typically use my portable speaker outdoors when I am in the pool or hot tub ( or various random locations usually with a bottle of beer nearby ) . While I have never knocked my speaker in a body of water , I am always worried about it getting splashed or spilled on or dripped on . The 2o takes care of that concern by making this speaker waterproof . I love being able to listen to music near the water without being vigilant about my young daughter being too splashy or accidentally tipping a drink onto my speaker. < br /> The unit sounds great and has a long lasting battery . I have been using it all weekend , probably about 6 hours total and have n't needed to charge it up ( in fact it still has 2 of the 3 display lights lit up which indicate the amount of charge remaining ) . I love both the long battery life and the remaining charge display features . Few things are worse than thinking you have a party 's worth of charge and then having the battery on your speaker die. < br /> The speaker comes with an audio aux . cable so that you can connect it to your music source if you want to conserve charge or do not have bluetooth capability . It also features a micro SD card slot so you can play music even without a smart phone or mp3 player . I tried this feature out and thought it was great . You can even skip songs with the buttons on top of the unit . All of the jacks and the card slot are protected by a removable rubber flap to keep moisture and dirt out . It closes easily by pushing in but I ran my finger around the edge of the flap firmly to make sure it was properly sealed. < br /> I found it easy to connect to my phone , you simply turn on the speaker , turn your music player 's the bluetooth on and hold down the play / pause button and it tells you when it is connected ( it actually says &# 34 ; connected &# 34 ; so there is no doubt ).< br /> I love the look and design of this speaker , it is fairly small but packs a great sound . I find myself using more than my in home stereo system because it sounds so great and I can take it with me where I go ( it even comes with a velcro carrying strap ).< br /> I have tried many wireless speakers and this is my favorite by far . I have lost more than one due to dropping ( in water and on hard surfaces ) so knowing that this is waterproof and shockproof is very reassuring. < br /> I highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants big sound in a small , waterproof package. < br /> Note : I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation.love the look and design of this speaker , it is fairly small but packs a great sound .

Bracket is pretty good but I had to spend an additional $ 19.00 for metal bracket extenders and additional nuts and bolts to make it work with my TV .

These are great quality headphones . They deliver on all the bells and whistles they tout . The ear piece is comfortable and has 3 sizes to ensure inner ear comfort . The over the ear piece is soft and flexible while still keeping the ear buds in place even while running . The cord is tangle free and the headset controls worked great , even on my old iPod shuffle !< br /> The reason for the 4 stars is the positioning of the cord and control placement . On most headphones there is the plug , one cord that splits into a &# 34 ; Y &# 34 ; , the controls a the juncture of the 2 smaller cords splitting off to each ear bud for the right and left ear . This cord splits in a way that there is a longer cord to the left ear than to the right . It is likely intended to reduce excess cords falling in the center of your torso but rather hang off to the right . So when I wear my iPhone on the left the cord is wonky . These controls are about 6 inches down from the right ear piece ( just past my jaw line ) . I found it an awkward place for me to pump up the volume or switch to the next song .#### #### ####[([18, 19], [2], 'POS'), ([18, 19], [21], 'POS'), ([18, 19], [145], 'POS'), ([54], [191], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [63], 'POS'), ([189], [21], 'POS'), ([194], [191], 'POS'), ([194], [217], 'POS')]

The logo has no effect on the sound quality , just the price of the item . This speaker can only play bass notes well in the mix down to 50z , below that I ca n't hear bass , but this is clearly because of how small it is .

Good for the price . I use it in the gym playing music from my phone .

Sound quality : Good Volume : Good Only had them a week , and so far they 're fine . My only issue is that the part that goes into the ear is too wide for comfort in my ears . Not the tips -- they supply an abundance of those to help with sizing , but the part that the tip fits on is just big like almost every other earbud out there . Rough estimate is maybe 1 / 4 inch in diameter . The only comfortable one I 've found is Klipsch at about 1 / 8 inch diameter , but their wires are so fragile they only last maybe three months . The AudiOHM has tough wires . Not the most attractive , but they should hold up -- if my ears will . Wish they had a volume control .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [3], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS')]
I purchased this with the hope that it would save me some money over the BMD or Aja alternatives . Turned out to be a total waste of $ 40 and a lot of time . I have fed SDI at every conceivable frame-rate , interlaced and progressive , at 1080 and though the SDI Lock light is activated when SDI is connected , it outputs nothing through the HDMI port . Nothing . Nada , zilch , zippo . I have other converters to help me rule out that the problem is in the SDI or HDMI cables in use . The EtekCity LKV368 is a featherweight brick made of plastic with a little light inside to make you think it should be working . It does n't . It is terrible . It does n't even make a good brick . It is sonic-welded so you ca n't even take a look inside . Do n't waste your money . UPDATE : I have revised my star power from 1 to 4 . Another reviewer alerted me to the fact the unit must be powered up AFTER all other connections have been made or it wo n't work . He was right . It works fine as long as you apply power last . Not perfect , but a solid 4 .#### #### ####[([54, 55], [91], 'POS'), ([69, 70], [91], 'POS'), ([108], [132], 'POS'), ([108], [207], 'POS'), ([95], [91], 'POS')]

I live in a very remote area in western Minnesota on a farm and I pick up 65 channels from up to 250 miles ! Yes ! 250 ! I verified the call letters I was getting and looked them up .

These remotes are much improved over the previous generation . I bought this replacement because the battery cover slides off easily and eventually broke on my old remote .

Good unit for the money . Did n't like the fact that each click to set the sound felt like was a big difference instead small increments would have been a better design .

I am an composer specializing in electronic music , and I work with Yamaha products every day . Keyboards , MIDI interfaces , etc. , so I thought their headphones would be a slam dunk . I compared specs to other brands like Bose , and Sony , and found they were ( on paper ) comparable . That 's about where the good experience ended ...< br />< br /> Cons :< br />- Comes with multiple earbud attachments , which ( no matter the size ) are uncomfortable to keep in for extended periods. < br />- Bass is not recognizable unless you cover your ears with your hands . Even then , the tones are weak and unrefined. < br />- Sound quality is lackluster . Apple 's hard plastic &# 34 ; iDevice &# 34 ; headphones have better sound quality in the mid range. < br />- If you are a power user , and are kicking amps at + 3DB , expect major distortion where other earbuds would remain clear. < br />< br /> Pros :< br />- Great packaging quality. < br />- Cords do not tangle easily. < br />- Ergonomic design fits your ears well ( see earbud attachment argument above ).< br />- If you are not concerned with A + sound quality , these have decent clarity. < br />< br /> I would not recommend these to my fellow music majors , and / or friends who listen to music constantly . If you 're in the market for great quality earbuds , spend the extra $ 30-40 , and get the $ 90 Bose Headphones at Sam 's Club .#### #### ####[([125], [118], 'NEG'), ([125], [89], 'NEG'), ([125], [127], 'NEG'), ([125], [227], 'NEG'), ([143, 144], [185], 'NEG'), ([143, 144], [227], 'NEG'), ([143, 144], [262], 'NEG')]

Seller offered a free diver mp3 player for a review . I purchased one for myself over a month ago and used several times in the pool . I swim regularly in local YMCA and sometimes got a bit bored of swim drills . Need a good mp3 player that I can listen radio or music . The diver meets my needs and fits the bill . Pros : 1 ) Reasonable priced . 2 ) Sounds loud and clean in the water . But you need to make sure you push the earbud all the way in . Cons : 1 ) After several laps , the earbud could still come loose . But you can simply adjust it a little bit and continue the lap . Not a big deal for me . 2 ) Player freezed one time reading a song . There is no way to reset other than just waiting for the battery to drain out . Overall , give it a try . Hopefully it works for you . If not , simply return it .#### #### ####[([72], [71], 'POS'), ([108], [112], 'POS'), ([108], [159, 160], 'POS')]

Sound is decent for a speaker this size . Tested with Pavarotti , Sarah Brightman , John Denver , etc . The acid test , where this speaker could not handle adequately is the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky . To be fair , to hear the cannons properly you pretty much need a separate subwoofer or at least a 10 &# 34 ; speaker , so I do n't think that this is a negative , rather just to set the expectation . Soprano comes thru fine ... tested with Whitney Houston 's song I 'll Always Love You from the album The Bodyguard. < br />< br /> Pairing was easy . No problems with Android phone and with Windows 8 tablet. < br />< br /> Light show really was of no interest to me , so would have preferred to save some money and done away with the lights .

Used LIGHTLY for three months and the cables started shorting out . I travel a lot and I bought these to use on the plane .

I was provided a sample to use and write an honest review. < br />< br /> I like the Battery1inc slim 2 port travel charger . It is a great solution as traveler 's on-the-road charger . It has one 1A port and one 2.1A port . Great for my iPhone and Kindle Fire when out on the road. < br />< br /> The charger is very thin and has folding US style AC Prongs . For the traveler it takes very little space in your bag and the folding prongs help it fit more easily in full bags . The design of the case is very thoughtful . With the prongs folded mine has no rough edges to catch a thread or damage stuff it 's packed in with. < br />< br /> In use the charger works great with my Kindle Fire or a Windows 8 tablet and my iPhone 6 . In the 2.1A port the Kindle fire charges fast as any charger . The same with the iPhone . The charger gets warm to the touch with charging 2 deeply discharged devices . But not uncomfortably warm at all. < br />< br /> In conclusion this simple product just works and proves that size matters in travel chargers . Careful design to take little space and not endanger my clothes with sharp edges or corners to cause a pull or run is appreciated by me . This very compact product is simple and gets the job done . That 's a 5 star item for me. < br />< br /> Hope this helps someone !< br />< br /> UPDATE : : Oct 10 , 2017 :< br /> I 've been using this for over 2 years it 's perfect for when I travel . I am more concerned than ever with saving space in my bags and this charger is perfect in that aspect . It continues to charge my phone and the tablet I travel with very well .

What a hassle . Two Nook basics . One without and one with Glowlight . My failures caused the screen to freeze displaying a Salvador Dali like scribble of lines and patches . Used the NOOK charger . Never left my bedside . There are no motors,magnets or anything else with fifteen feet that could have caused this . Had a real nightmare with Barnes & Noble about updating my ship to address . Five years and what , seventy tries online and the site defaulted t my old address . Called customer service . &# 34 ; Oh I am correcting that right this minute &# 34 ; a young man said as I could hear keyboard strokes over the phone . Two weeks later they shipped a replacement to the old address . They want a hundred dollars for a gizmo that costs as much as some basic smart phones . And it breaks . The phones are still working , taking images , playing music but the NOOK cannot display print and chew gum at the same time . Do n't even bother going to the B & N site for book reviews . It is a drop box for drug dealer messages . Barnes and Noble is setting themselves up for a Chapter 13 .#### #### ####[([19], [21], 'NEG'), ([170], [171, 172], 'NEG')]

To be honest I ca n't say as I am very impressed . It works better than the rabbit ears I was using , but not a big difference . I only get 14 channels most of which are garbage .

Confession .... I did n't try these for the express purpose of utilizing them with an android or Samsung device - though I have used them ( and still do ) . You buy BOSE for the sound ! It is everything one would want in these type of earphones - comfort , lightness of weight and ease of use . In all of these aspects I would rate them highly . As to the specific use with a phone - I find that the particular feature of accessing phone calls , to be one I rarely if ever use . However , I do use my phone as an mp3 player and for streaming music and for THAT purpose the unparalleled sound of BOSE comes to the fore . Now my main problem is how to keep them out of the hands of my children ... .#### #### ####[([37], [70], 'POS'), ([37], [121], 'POS')]

Are these the most powerful headphones I have ever wrapped my ears around ? Yes ! Best Sounding ? More than likely . Most durable ? Definitely YES on that one . Durability is certainly their middle name and with a price tag like that , you will definitely appreciate it . The frame is composed from light metal material , so while they are solid and tough to break , they do come at a cost of being slightly heavy than your average headphones . They are about 14 ounces . They are certainly not subtle either if you choose to wear them outside . Certainly they can cause fatigue after a prolonged use. < br />< br /> It includes a 3.5 - 6.3 mm adapter for DJ purposed , but it will certainly play on your phone as well ( I was able to use it just fine on a Samsung S4 phone . ) There is just ONE pair of ear cushions , which should fit most ears out there . However , for a price tag like that , they could 've added several instead of making you buy addition sizes for extra price. < br />< br /> These are not in a direct competition with Dr Dre beats as I do n't think that is what Philips is trying to do here . Dr Dre is more stylish and designed for personal use , while these are designed for personal and DJ use and are extra durable . Sure , they are pricey , but as always -- you get what you pay for ! It also includes a nice carrying case as these can be folded as well .#### #### ####[([278], [276], 'POS'), ([278], [16], 'POS')]

While the sound for this small waterproof speaker is not as full as I 'd like , its benefits as a portable , outdoor speaker make it a good choice . It has a large suction cup on back to attach it to glass , shower wall , or another smooth , glossy surface , and it can be clipped to a backpack , tote , or other object . The volume gets really loud for a party or for when you want your music blasting . The battery life is great , too . It 's small enough to fit in the palm of my hand , about a 3.5 &# 34 ; diameter and 1.5 &# 34 ; thick , excluding the suction cup. < br />< br /> If you 're okay with adequate base and somewhat thin highs -- not bad sound , just not fantastic sound -- then this might be for you . The portable and waterproof design makes it a nice choice for the beach , pool , shower , or camping .

I got two sets of these headphones during one of the Amazon specials . Now , these are not noise reducing but they do have a good sound , are very lightweight , and store in an incredibly tiny mount of space . The ear cups fold back under the headband reducing the footprint to almost nothing. < br />< br /> The best thing , though , is the feel . They are very comfortable and can be worn ( and have been worn ) for a full day at work. < br />< br /> While the headphones are listed as iPhone headphones , they can be used for android phones . In the case of LG and Samsung phones , the volume buttons on the headset do not work but the middle button can be pressed to pause the playback and resume it . Not really a big deal as far as I am concerned .#### #### ####[([70], [63], 'POS'), ([70], [75], 'POS'), ([135], [130, 131], 'POS'), ([27], [26], 'POS'), ([27], [75], 'POS'), ([44, 45], [46, 47], 'POS'), ([44, 45], [130, 131], 'POS')]

I give it 5 starts because the sound quality is the BEST . 100x better than LG tone Infinim which is top. < br /> BUT where it lacks is the speaker during calls , you have to talk reallllly loud for the other end to hear you well , like too loud to hold conversations comfortably. < br /> BUT these are for jogging !

Leveling with a Vizio M70-C3 70 &# 34 ; 4K tv . Everything went well , except for the leveling . Here 's my $ 1.00 fix . It takes a leap of faith to let go of that tv after it is mounted , but the bracket does as advertised ; except , hold this large size tv level . No matter how tight I tightened the two screws on the back ( Screw S ) in the instructions , the tv would still lean to the right ( front facing ) . I eventually removed the bottom screw and took it to home depot because I was slowly stripping out the head . I found that this is a metric M5 x 16mm Flat hd Phillips Zinc Plated machine screw with Home Depot part # 574 792 . I picked up a pack of those , but also the M5 -. 8 x 16MM Pan Head Philips machine screw ( 2 pack ) with Home Depot # 204 462 ( http :// www.homedepot.com / p / Crown-Bolt-M5-16-mm-Phillips-Pan-Head-Machine-Screws-2-Pack-36958 / 202836136 ) . I ended up using the pan head on the bottom and that worked great , immediately solving the problem. < br />< br /> For some reason , no matter how tight I tightened the screws that came with the device , it would n't hold .

I received this water proof speaker and took it right away to test by the beach . I 'm giving it 4 starts because it does a fantastic job for its size but is probably a tad less powerful than what I originally expected .

If used for personal entertainment by the pool it would do just fine but we were not able to use it at my husbands party because the noise level was higher past 6 folks ( we had 50 + ppl so reverted back to our standard speaker ) overall very happy with it though do n't get me wrong I think it 's a perfectly fine speaker for its size extremely portable which is a very big plus#### #### ####[([91], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([91, 92], [94], 'POS')]

This speaker was very loud and had great fidelity , to the point where I felt I was wasting its potential using it with my PSP . I gifted it to someone else who enjoys it even more . The reliance on external batteries rather than internal , rechargeable one was the only turnoff to me . It daisy-chained with other portable speakers well and sounded great even with bass-heavy metal music . The case is nice , too . I may have to get another couple as gifts this year . Great price , great design , great sound . Power cable 's kind of short and rather flimsy-feeling - needs extra care . Further , the batteries do n't last nearly as long as in my other portable speakers , but for something using standard batteries and being so loud , it 's to be expected . This is the kind you want for filling the kitchen with sound or a day at the beach , but if you just want a quiet sound source for playing stuff in your bedroom at home , most any decent portable speaker will do .#### #### ####[([102], [98], 'POS'), ([102], [76], 'POS'), ([8], [98], 'POS'), ([8], [95], 'POS'), ([93], [92], 'POS'), ([96], [98], 'POS'), ([96], [95], 'POS'), ([99], [98], 'POS'), ([99], [95], 'POS')]

Everything was included that was needed for the install plus a few extra bonuses . There are Velcro straps on the arm to secure the wires which makes for a very clean look . Plus it includes a 6 ' HDMI cable also. < br />< br /> Great quality , fast shipping . Could n't be happier and I did n't have to spend $ 100 at the local big box stores for a lesser quality TV mount . Do n't be scared to purchase#### #### ####[([59], [61], 'POS'), ([59], [104], 'POS')]

I have an old speaker system in my walls throughout the house and it does n't have a Bluetooth option to play music through it . So every time I want to listen to the tunes in all rooms I have to plug my phone into the audio jack and leave it there . Kind of frustrating . So when I got offered to try out this little gadget at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review , I jumped on it. < br /> Well this little device has changed my life . The Assem Bluetooth Transmitter is very easy to use , connect it to your bluetooth capable device , plug it into the serious and voila you get music without sacrificing your phone ☺.< br /> The sound quality is very good . On some songs you can here a little fuzzy noise but once you turn it up , it disappears. < br />< br /> I also tried it out with my old laptop that is not bluetooth enabled and plugged the assem transmitter into the laptop audio jack and connected my bluetooth headphones to listen to something on Netflix . Work like a charm. < br />< br /> Overall I can recommend the gadget. < br /> It works great as a receiver and transmitter . Sound quality is excellent. < br /> The price is reasonable. < br /> Battery lasts for me 6 + hours .#### #### ####[([99, 100], [56], 'POS'), ([99, 100], [138], 'POS'), ([106], [104], 'POS'), ([106], [220], 'POS'), ([134, 135], [56], 'POS'), ([134, 135], [104], 'POS'), ([134, 135], [138], 'POS'), ([134, 135], [220], 'POS'), ([181, 182], [56], 'POS'), ([181, 182], [138], 'POS'), ([227, 228], [104], 'POS'), ([227, 228], [138], 'POS'), ([227, 228], [220], 'POS'), ([235], [104], 'POS'), ([235], [220], 'POS')]

I chose the Cheetah mount for my 40 &# 34 ; TCL Roku TV after a lot of researching . This was a great price ($ 28 ) and had amazing reviews . Now I see why . The mount itself is heavier than my TV , but not too heavy . My TV is just very light . My boyfriend was able to put together the mount and hang it in under than 30 minutes . It only required two people for the hanging of the TV itself ( the mount screws into the TV ) . It was a super painless experience , and after a few days of having it , I LOVE it . It looks so professional to not be able to see the mount at all . And it moves with ease , but not so easy that it moves without you wanting it to . It tilts 360 degrees and has a pretty large range of movement . Not to mention the well thought out packing . It came with a small level to help you install the mount , and a very nice corded HDMI cord that is 10 ' long in case you need a longer cord than what you were using with the TV closer to the ground . I would highly recommend this TV mount ! !#### #### ####[([24], [23], 'POS'), ([39], [42], 'POS'), ([172], [160], 'POS'), ([172], [169], 'POS'), ([172], [222], 'POS')]

It 's amazing how well these things hold up to being in sweaty ears . They 're comfortable and do exactly what they say they do . Provide a good seal and stay put . A quick bit of size advice since it 's not always obvious . They say to order the same size ( s / m / l - not the line #) that you 'd normally use in the stock silicon tips . My version of this is to compare it to using compressible foam ear-plugs . If you can roll a set of foam ear-plugs up and insert them as per instructions and have them be all but unnoticeable in your ears - go for the size large . If you put in foam ear-plugs and they just peek out off your ears , go for medium . If you put in foam ear-plugs and they barely go in , go for the small. < br /> fwiw , I 've found the 500 series seems to fit the mpow / copies of the Swifts and Cheetahs even though there 's no official compatibility on their chart .#### #### ####[([30], [29], 'POS'), ([30], [113], 'POS')]

Sleek , small ( see photo ) and comes complete with headphones and everything you need to get started. < br />< br /> I was given one of these in exchange for an unbiased review and , for the most part , I really like it . Great for storing books and music , though there are any number of other things it can do that I have n't tried yet . It 's tiny size means that it can go anywhere . It 's tiny size , however , is a double-edged sword : it can make the screen a bit hard to see. < br /> For the price and considering all that it does , I still think this an excellent buy .

These do offer good sound quality , while they work . Upon arrival , one of the sides did not work . I plugged it into multiple devices and had no luck . I was able to exchange the defective pair for new ones . The exchange process was super easy . I had my new ones before I had even sent back the defective pair . The second pair worked well . I do n't use them much , so I probably had them for about 3 months , but they had only been used a dozen times before one side quit working . At this point , I could n't return them . I looked up the warranty information , but for the cost of shipping them to be repaired or replaced , I can simply buy something else , which will hopefully be more reliable . I ignored other reviews about one side not working because I figured every electronic is prone to defects . However , when it happens twice , it 's simply poor manufacturing .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [3], 'NEG'), ([17], [19, 20], 'NEG'), ([17], [102, 103], 'NEG'), ([17], [156, 157], 'NEG'), ([17], [178], 'NEG')]

I have been using the HX-P930 for a few days and it 's nice for it 's size and price , but I had hoped for a little better sound.At less than two pounds the HX-P930 is lightweight enough to take around with you . Even though it has a small footprint , the buttons on it are nice and large . I was able to connect all of our Android phones to it via bluetooth , no problem. < br />< br /> The music quality is okay compared to other bluetooth speakers . I have a House of Marley EM-JA006-MI that I absolutely love . It is a much larger unit , but the sound quality is superb compared to this Jam speaker . The sound from the HX-P930 is not bad , but it does n't seem to fill our living room with the rich immersive sounds like our other speaker. < br />< br /> The light show is cute . The kids love it . They typically sit in a darkened bedroom and listen to music with the light show on to see it glow . The light show works independent of the music . It does not follow the beats , except by accident . There are several modes where you can pick a single color , or a rainbow . You can also have it be solid , act like equalizer bars , or randomly pulsate. < br />< br /> It is a nice speaker , priced well , and has the novelty light show . It will be our backup speaker when someone has taken our Marley#### #### ####[([19], [13], 'NEU'), ([19], [255], 'NEU'), ([17], [13], 'NEU'), ([17], [255], 'NEU')]

So i picked these up from my work on a heavy discount but i felt the need to personally review these for other 's sake . These are some of the nicest headphone 's i have ever had the opportunity to use . Very clear and distortion free high 's and low 's with very subtle but rich bass on song 's where it is a huge element . The sound quality it superb on every genre of music I listened to with them . The only possible draw back i can give about these headphones is that the wire 's do give a somewhat recognizable reverb when touched , although to be fair i have noticed this on all of the other noise canceling headphone 's I 've used in the past so I do n't count that as a huge issue . All in all these headphones are top quality and I would highly reccomend them to anyone who was looking for a good pair of high end earbuds .#### #### ####[([58], [57], 'POS'), ([70, 71], [73], 'POS'), ([70, 71], [150], 'POS')]
[[ VIDEOID : aef2960dfec761d8316408574cdf78a5 ]] The iGadgitz Volcano Bluetooth speaker is one of the more unusual speakers I have seen and used . It is a small speaker with unusual controls . Unusual in this case is not a bad thing , though - this is a good speaker that works well. < br />< br /> This is a small and attractive little speaker , a little smaller than a 1-cup measure . It is a cylinder with a recessed speaker in the middle of th top , hence the name . It has a brushed steel finish on th outside and overall is not unattractive. < br />< br /> I ran into a slight problem when I was testing with it that proved to be a minor issue and was easily remedied - in the middle of testing , it ran out of battery power . When the battery was exhausted , the speaker simply cut off with no indicator that the issue was coming . While that 's ok , it would have been nice to have had a little warning that the battery was dying . Other than this little detail , this speaker has not given me any issues at all. < br />< br /> It pairs and connects with no issue . When turned on and set to pair , it broadcasts its ID as \\" Volcano 2 \\" . I paired it to my phone and it very connected and was ready to go in a few seconds , faster than most other speakers I have used. < br />< br /> I fed some music to it and it demonstrated a good sound profile . The bass is a little soft but not unacceptable . The midrange is good and as a result the music has a decent amount of depth , sounding neither hollow or like it came from a tunnel . The highs are good and are very clear . When it comes to the sound profile of Bluetooth speakers many tend to overdrive the bass and kill the midrange , but this one is better with the midrange - very much preferable. < br />< br /> Where this speaker gets interesting is in the volume control . The control is actually a movable ring on the underside of the speaker and by turning the speaker while it 's on a flat surface it is possible to adjust the volume up or down . It took me a little practice to get this right , and I conferred with the documentation to make sure . This is one of those rare cases with a Bluetooth speaker where I do recommend reading the included documentation. < br />< br /> Operating range is somewhere between 30 ' and 35 ' before it starts to cut out or stutter . This is above average and just makes this speaker even better. < br />< br /> I like this speaker . It has good sound , good range and interesting controls . The fact that it looks cool is a bonus. < br />< br /> Disclaimer : I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair , honest and thorough review . Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias , based solely on my experience with it.right , and I conferred with the documentation to make sure .

I tried this on 2 other antennas db8 and 2 db4 with preamps , and it would not pick up a thing , but with the lava 8008 it boosted my pickup on 3 channels from 50 percent to 100 percent so far it is doing great , but I just got it connected 2 days ago , I would highly reccomend it for a lava 8008 . I called lava before trying it and they assured me it would not mess anything up , so far great , god bless !#### #### ####[([31], [29], 'POS')]

I do n't write reviews , but the customer service for this company was outstanding and deserves kudos . I give this item a four star , and it did n't even work for me . I bought an RV and it took me the first trip to find out I did n't have the remote for the TV . I tried a Samsung programmable and punched in every code known to man , but nothing worked . I next tried this , but it did not work either . The difference was the fact that when I asked for a return slip a representative took the time to try and trouble shoot the problem for me . It was only after several failed attempts ( on my end ) that we decided the remote would not work and they sent a return slip . I am not sure it is n't something wrong with the TV , or some off-the-wall coding issue. < br />< br /> If this company can fix the problem they will . Remote was well made and appeared sturdy#### #### ####[([8, 9], [14], 'POS'), ([8, 9], [180], 'POS'), ([55], [51, 52], 'POS'), ([55], [136, 137], 'POS')]

We 've had a Vizio smart TV for close to three years now and a few buttons on the original remote no longer work . Our original did n't have the QWERTY side but even so , this version works fine with ours . We 've only tested it with Netflix though . We control YouTube with our iPhones . ( I wish there was a remote app for this TV ! ) For the price , this was well worth it . I just wish I 'd done it sooner since the remote is pretty essential to using the apps and our kids are prone to misplacing the other . The new remote is for Mommy and Daddy only and kept way out of the kids' reach . Our kids are only allowed to use the junky remote now . :)#### #### ####[([16], [21, 22], 'POS')]
For Men 's watch only-My husband ordered this watch for me and said it did n't indicate anywhere that it will not work with the ladies colored ( pink ) watches .

Does what it needs to do well . It needs time to think when you change inputs though .

Excellent little speaker . Bought it for my son to hook up to his phone . Better build quality than i thought operates easily for non tech savy people like myself because i tested it before giving it to him . I am somewhat of an audiophile and i was impressed with the sound output . Its not going to hit the low notes well or rattle windows odviously because its a small wireless speaker physics just wont allow it . But given what it is you really cant beat it for the money . Good volume clear but not overwhelming highs nice midrange and like i said the low end extends further down than I thought but its just not going to reproduce that kind of sound so dont expect it out of any little speaker . I am going to get myself one i am that happy .#### #### ####[([54], [50], 'POS'), ([54], [16], 'POS'), ([54], [102], 'POS'), ([103], [102], 'POS'), ([17, 18], [50], 'POS'), ([17, 18], [16], 'POS'), ([109, 110], [72], 'POS')]
I 'm in love with these headphones ! For the price they are damn near perfect . The controls are great , even though I have the occasional glitch , still so handy . The mic works surprisingly well everyone says I sound clear when making calls . The sound is good at least as far as my untrained ears can tell. < br />< br /> I got the white and like how it looks with my fair skin and bleach blonde hair . It folds up so small I can slip it into a non tight pocket no problem . The charge lasts FOREVER ! I 've had it 6 weeks ? listening on average 2 hours a day often much more and I have charged it only 3 times ! Once only b / c I listened to it for probably 24hrs straight while flying across the country and back . Comfortable and functional . My only gripe is that the led light is very bright especially at night . On the bright side it doubles as a safety feature while I 'm out biking at night . :) Would definitely recommend and buy again !#### #### ####[([165], [38], 'POS'), ([165], [168], 'POS'), ([10], [15], 'POS'), ([18], [20], 'POS'), ([49], [20], 'POS'), ([49], [51], 'POS'), ([103], [20], 'POS'), ([103], [51], 'POS')]

The mid range sounds absolutely bad to me . Not bad as in good but as in crap . The highs are n't crisp and there is bass , but I 've heard better from Philips SHE-5390 ( half cost of these ) . The best thing about these are the tangle free cables . Pretty nice feature for such a cheap IEM . These did n't fit into my ears and seal without the use of Comply tips .

Right off the bat I 'll say that I 've used an awful lot of Bluetooth Speakers and Headphones , so I guess I 'm always looking for the perfect one , and the TT-SK08 could just be that . You see I need a portable speaker to connect wirelessly to my phone when I 'm in the garden , working in the garage , tidying up the workshop or fixing the car. < br /> This means that the speaker is going to get dirty , wet , dropped and kicked around a lot , and so the unit I need has to be up to all that , and so far , this speaker from Taotronics is just that. < br /> The battery lasts long enough , the speaker is loud and has plenty of bass , and I have n't been able to break it yet ( and neither has my son ) so it 's recommended , and I 'd like to thank Taotronics for sending me one to review .#### #### ####[([131], [133], 'POS')]
Awesome / Vibrant / Neat Gadget . Enough volume for the apt / house . Myself was looking for something extra loud for the beach . Not as loud as i wanted for the outdoors .

*** knockoff alert !!!*** So I 'm in a box box store and I see these ( after giving the pair I bought to my son because to me they sounded HORRIBLE ) . Hmm the silver part is n't as shiny . Big box version looks better made . So I bought them and compared to ( the Amazon ) ones I gave to my son ( after adequate burn-in time )... all I can say is there 's a HUGE difference ! There is no way the ones I purchased from Amazon are the real deal ... NO WAY ! Buy the real ones and they 're awesome , whereas these sold thru Amazon are junk . I 'd give the big box store ( rea ) version 4 stars . For the price , 4 stars is excellent . These will never replace the XB-90EX 's I own ( I own 2 pair , 1 use , 1 as a spare in case others die ) but those are reserved for dedicated listening sessions . Being active , the real XB50 's are my go-to choice .#### #### ####[([36, 37], [38, 39], 'NEG')]

I have a few bluetooth speakers but none that compare to this one !< br /> I purchased the Bluetooth Waterproof Speaker by SOUNDXLTM for my 16 year daughter because she asked for one to use in the shower . Since I was offered this speaker at a discount for my unbiased review , I thought I 'd try it out. < br /> As soon as it arrived she had the box open and was ready to test it out . It connected quickly to her phone and &# 34 ; talked &# 34 ; her through so she knew it was on and connected . The suction cup included with the speaker stuck to her shower without slipping and has been there for days without falling off . The sound quality was much better than I would expect from such a small speaker and the volume is loud enough that I can hear her music from the other side of the house . Even with the volume all the way up , the sound is not at all distorted as it is with most smaller speakers . I 'm extremely with this purchase !#### #### ####[([132], [135], 'POS'), ([108, 109], [149], 'POS'), ([108, 109], [180], 'POS'), ([131, 132], [135], 'POS')]

Great sound and base ... not top-notch , but very good for the price . They do n't illumnate ... I was skeptical that they would anyway , assuming there was n't enough power coming from a stereo outlet , but I do n't like the false advertising . The over-ear mounts do an okay job , but the cable sometimes slips out of the slit . If you use these a lot , especially professionally for a band / DJ setup , I 'd get more expensive ones that have the memory wire near the ear . If you 're on a budget , these are very good .#### #### ####[([59], [61, 62], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS'), ([13], [54], 'POS'), ([13], [10], 'POS'), ([50, 51], [54], 'POS'), ([50, 51], [10], 'POS')]

I have mixed feelings about these ear phones . The sound quality is a huge step above the standard iPhone buds , but just about anything is an upgrade to those . There are some things that are great , but a few improvements would make these the type of quality I would expect from the Bose brand. < br />< br /> The good :< br />- Stands up to sweat as advertised . I wore these while weed-eating on a day when the temps were in the high 80s , so they definitely got wet. < br />- Stays in ears securely , though if your ears do not have pronounced ridges your performance may vary. < br />- Good sound quality , with a decent compromise between filtering out some outside noise but allowing enough in for awareness of one 's surroundings. < br />< br /> The bad :< br />- The cord seems flimsy and tangles easily . I much prefer the flat ribbon type cable design used in other sports earbuds. < br />- No microphone for use with cell phones. < br />- Price point : $ 150 is very high for these , considering that the sound quality is good but not stellar . You always pay a bit extra for the Bose brand , but in the case of this product I do n't think the price difference is justified . I have Etymotic HF5 earphones that were less expensive and sound much better. < br />< br /> These earphones would be a decent choice for someone who wants a respectable set of earphones for exercising and feels comfortable purchasing a well-known brand . However , with a little research one could find comparable products for a lower price .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [2], 'NEU'), ([10, 11], [121], 'NEU'), ([10, 11], [207], 'NEU')]

Sound equipment on hand :< br /> Etymotics er4p < br /> Grado Sr60 < br /> Jaybird Bluebuds X < br />< br /> My sound preference includes neutral mids and bass , with a slight emphasis on the highs . Usually anything from Grado fits the bill for me , sonically . I regard anything that 's bass heavy ( a la any Beats headphones ) , or mid-heavy / muddy ( skullcandy / apple headphones ) as crap . So please consider my preferences , as your expectations may differ from mine. < br />< br /> The BLU-100 sound the most like Grados . The highs are bright , but the bass has more of a presence without being boomy or muddy . I was actually very impressed with them the first time I fired them up . For $ 40 , I was expecting the sound of $ 20 headphones , but with the addition of BT . Pleasant surprise. < br />< br /> The Bluebuds X have more subdued highs , with slightly more exaggerated bass . To me , a bit less clarity , which is unfortunate because it 's nearly 3-4X the cost of the BLU-100. < br />< br /> Where the BLU-100s fail is reception . If you keep the full length of the cord draped across your back , most likely your reception will be fine . I attempted to shorten the cord by folding it over itself , a la the Bluebuds X , but once you do , you lose MASSIVE range on the headphones. < br />< br /> My original intent was to use the BLU-100 ( with its long cord folded on itself and tied behind my head ) paired with my android wear Moto 360 smartwatch . But , when the cord is folded , you BT signal becomes weak and the audio becomes choppy . But , if you allow the BLU-100 to drape without any folding of the cord , reception works fine on the android wear device . For me this was n't an option so I had to return it. < br />< br /> Otherwise , the fitment is fine with the comply tips , and I had no issues with these staying in while sprinting .#### #### ####[([215], [125], 'POS'), ([215], [181], 'POS'), ([215], [317], 'POS'), ([215], [322], 'POS'), ([30], [29], 'POS'), ([30], [372], 'POS'), ([40], [317], 'POS'), ([109], [111], 'POS'), ([109], [175], 'POS'), ([109], [372], 'POS'), ([115], [125], 'POS'), ([115], [317], 'POS'), ([115], [322], 'POS'), ([176], [111], 'POS'), ([176], [175], 'POS'), ([176], [372], 'POS'), ([182], [181], 'POS'), ([182], [322], 'POS'), ([190], [123], 'POS'), ([190], [125], 'POS'), ([190], [181], 'POS'), ([190], [237], 'POS'), ([190], [317], 'POS'), ([190], [322], 'POS')]

These headphones come with a durable zippered case . They also come with a bunch of different sizes of the buds that fit in your ear as well as the pieces that hold them in your ear while you work out . Also included is a cord for charging by USB .

I used these headphone for outdoor running in an urban environment. < br />< br /> Good : They are very light . Built and sound quality are good , and they fit comfortably ( although the neck band may be too short for people with very big necks ).< br />< br /> Bad : Do n't use these headphones for outdoor running . The ear pieces fully sealed off my ear canal and cancelled out any ambient street noises which made me feel very unsafe running along and across streets . I could n't hear anything that was going on around me . At the same time , my own sounds ( movement , breathing , rubbing of the t-shirt on the neckband ) got amplified and made listening to music very unpleasant . This also contributed to the fact that I could n't hear what was going on around me . I cannot recommend these headphones for outdoor running . Sennheiser PMX 685i are much better for this as they do n't completely close off your ears .#### #### ####[([25, 26], [28], 'NEG'), ([32], [33], 'NEG'), ([37, 38], [42], 'NEG'), ([66, 67], [134], 'NEG'), ([66, 67], [33], 'NEG'), ([66, 67], [69, 70], 'NEG'), ([23], [28], 'NEG')]

Very frustrating . As usual with Logitech , the hardware is great , while the software is substandard . The remote works fabulously , once you get it setup . However , the setup is a long and exasperating procedure because of all the glitches and bugs in the software .

Really great , until the speakers blew ( fuzzy noise ) . I only used this speaker for about 3 months until the speakers blew . They were great when they worked , but it did n't last long .

For the price , I am shocked that these do not include any noise-canceling technology . In fact , overall , I am somewhat disappointed in these Bose headphones. < br />< br /> A little back story . Two decades ago , I had purchased a very expensive pair of Bose headphones . I purchased them from a high-end stereo store , and the salesman at the time ( a friend ) said that they were overpriced for the audio quality . &# 34 ; You 're buying the name &# 34 ; he told me . My dad , though , had a pair of Bose speakers he had picked up on his way back from Vietnam , and I LOVED the audio quality . My friend told me I could get another pair of headphones for fifty bucks cheaper that sounded a lot better . I did n't listen , purchased the Bose , and went home to enjoy my CDs . A week later , I returned the headphones , and got the less expensive pair . ( KOSS ) My friend was correct after all . At that point , I swore off Bose as expensive but not as good in audio quality . I took on his mantra as my own . &# 34 ; Your buying the name. &# 34 ;< br />< br /> This brings us to these Bose headphones . They are the first Bose I have owned since the early 1990s . I did n't want to bias my opinion , so I went in with an open mind . Usually a fan nowadays of Shure and AKG , I was really interested to see ( hear ) if Bose had pushed past the &# 34 ; more money for less quality &# 34 ;< br />< br /> Sadly , no. < br />< br /> The first time I started to listen to them , I was happy . They sounded pretty full , bright , and clear . They do a decent job of blocking regular sounds , but are terrible on an airplane . After an hour , though , I realized that something was off . I switch over to my normal AKGs and found out that the Bose were mudding the bass . I did n't notice at first , but the more I listened , the more noticeable it became. < br />< br /> I REALLY wanted to like these headphones . They are very comfortable to wear , a big selling factor for me . In comfort alone , I would rank these an almost perfect score . The audio controls for your Android phone works well , but sadly does nothing in an iPhone . This is an odd choice , as I have used plenty of headphones over the last few years that control volume and pause / play just fine on both Android and iOS . Either Bose skimped on the controls , or their marketing team decided to focus on Android for ... well , whatever reason. < br />< br /> Audio quality is good , not great , and not terrible . Comfort is amazing . At this price-point , I do expect a lot better . I have a pair of $ 79 Harman Kardon headphones that blow these away in audio quality . And , sadly , my friend from all those years is still correct : with Bose , you are buying the hype , not the quality.but sadly does nothing in an iPhone .

You need bass this will literally shake the floor , air , chest , heart , brain into the biggest smile a movie guy can strap on . My favorite thing about this is it can produce so much sound so smooth that low frequencies can be felt . Example : A spaceship in a SiFi movie engine room pulses you feel the pulse not just hear it . These make movies come alive in a manner I had not experienced . I have two of these and will be buying two more with the wireless adapter when I get the movie room . They are self powered so no need to do anything but plug them in .#### #### ####[([44], [43], 'POS')]

I am writing this review while listening to these headphones , and I absolutely love them . I am a complete audiophile , but on a budget. < br /> The styling of these headphones is out of the ordinary , and I love it . They seem durable so far , but I have n't owned them long enough to know if they truly last long . The carrying case provided is extremely stylish and seems durable . Carrying the headphones in the carrying case is a MUST if you want these headphones to have a long life. < br />< br /> I 've used Monster DNA headphones for the longest time , thinking that they were the best in ear headphones at this price point . I 've owned the same pair for the last two and a half years , and they 're still going strong . Granted , one of the plastic covers came off on the headphones , but superglue fixed that problem . The highs and mids of the DNAs are pretty clear , but you could tell that the bass is a little too strong , even for my liking . I enjoy listening to rap and hip hop daily , so I enjoy a overly healthy amount of bass in my audio equipment. < br />< br /> After looking into a pair of back-up headphones , I checked these out and ordered a pair . I paid $ 38 for these , compared to $ 55 for the DNA's. < br /> After seeing the top review for this item , I was excited to see if these headphones would truly &# 34 ; change the way I listened to music &# 34 ; . Well let me tell you ... these do just that . The Diesels completely blew me away . I still get chills when I listen to music everyday with these . The mids and highs are clearer than any other headphone I 've ever listened to , ever . I 've listened to pretty much every other monster headphone , and these are the ones that stick out majorly . Each layer of sound in each song is separated beautifully . You can honestly hear each individual instrument on its own when you listen to country , rock , or any other type of music . When you listen to Hip hop and rap , you can hear each individual component of the song , crystal clear . Let me note on the bass of these headphones too . They are n't overpowering like the DNA 's , not even close . In fact , they 're dead accurate at reproducing the exact bass note , no matter what music you 're listening to . These healthily blend the mids , highs , and lows for the most perfect balance I 've ever heard . I 've heard parts of songs that I 've never heard before with these headphones . I ca n't believe I got these for $ 38 . I feel like I stole them for that price. < br />< br /> My girlfriend listened to these headphones once , and told me how much she loves them . She has a pair of bose headphones , and says that these headphones blew her away . I just ordered her a pair , and am considering ordering myself another pair , in case I lose these. < br />< br /> The Monster DNAs are now my back-up headphones . However , I might order another pair of Diesel 's as a back-up , and just use the DNA 's as a working out headphone . I cannot express how much I love these headphones . Buy these , and they will change the way you listen to music .#### #### ####[([187], [192], 'POS'), ([329], [179], 'POS'), ([329], [331], 'POS'), ([329], [483], 'POS'), ([428], [192], 'POS'), ([327], [179], 'POS'), ([327], [331], 'POS'), ([327], [483], 'POS')]

Overall , I like arm design of the mount but installing it poses some challenges. < br />< br /> First , the extension arms for anything above 200x200 are secured by two screws fastened with nuts which already makes things a little harder . The nuts have some sort of unthreaded plastic in the front end that you ca n't easily screw the screw into the nut . I almost stripped a couple screws before I just used the screw as a holder and a socket wrench to tighten the nut . This is really the best way. < br />< br /> The next challenge was that , unlike some other designs , the mounting plate for the TV does not detach from the mount so you need a small army of people to hold the tv in place for either screwing the whole assembly into the wall or the wall-attached mount to the TV. < br />< br /> Last , the mounting plate not detaching from the mount would n't have been quite as big of a problem except that ... the extension arms did n't quite match up with the holes on the TV . I 've used other mounts previously so this was definitely an issue with the design of this product . We did eventually get it to work by loosening the screws between the extension arms and the main plate but that was entirely less than ideal and not made any easier due to nut / screw design for fastening the arms. < br />< br /> I liked the mount once I got it up there but do not look forward to having to move it in the future ... If you do buy the mount , make sure you have the following :< br /> A good socket wrench < br /> A team of people to help you install it#### #### ####[([23, 24], [43], 'NEU'), ([23, 24], [188, 189], 'NEU'), ([23, 24], [242, 243], 'NEU')]

This antenna went up on a mast that already had another antenna on it that I use for HAM radio . It took approximately 20 minutes to un-box , spread the elements til they clicked into place , fasten to the mast , run a cable to my TV and scan for air band channels . It 's simple design and ease of use are amazing and it really made a big difference compared to the previous indoor HD antenna I was using . I highly recommend this antenna .

Initially I purchased this item to use with my Galaxy S3 . And while it worked decently , I did n't think it worked all that well . The picture movement was n't at all that smooth . I thought it might have been the processor in the phone that caused it to be slow . I 've since upgraded to a Note 4 . And while the phone has a faster processor , the picture did n't improve all that much . I 've since decided to give up on this item and glad that I did n't spend that much money on it . If the slowed picture does n't bother you then I would tell you to buy it . But for me it kinda defeats the purpose in watching a movie . I 'd rather just watch it on my computer or my phone and skip the slowed movements . I 'm sure there is something else better on the market .#### #### ####[([45], [31, 32], 'NEU'), ([72], [71], 'NEU'), ([72], [76, 77], 'NEU'), ([75], [76, 77], 'NEU'), ([29, 30], [31, 32], 'NEU'), ([29, 30], [76, 77], 'NEU')]

When I set out to build my home theater I did quite a bit of shopping around for the receiver . I had almost pulled the trigger on an Onkyo , but I came across the Yamaha RX-V series . They seemed to be pretty good &# 34 ; bang for your buck &# 34 ; receivers , and it just so happened that Amazon was having a sale on the 677 . For the feature set that it had , and the price they were selling it for , it was a no brainer . I hit the buy button and never looked back !< br />< br /> I previously had a &# 34 ; 1000 watt &# 34 ; RCA Home theater in a box setup that was temporarily powering my new speakers , but it was n't doing a great job of it . I also could n't hook all of them up due to it being a 5.1 output but I ran speakers for 7.1 . Once I got the Yamaha unit installed I was in for quite the treat . This thing blows my old RCA HTIB receiver out of the water ! Outstanding sound , so many features , and it looks fantastic. < br />< br /> Initial setup is a breeze , with an intuitive on-screen menu that makes the process as painless as could be . You 'll be up and running in no time flat . If you choose to use it , the YPAO auto setup is pretty neat . I went and tweaked the settings a bit more afterwards to get it to my liking . The auto adjustment is a great feature and is a good way to get your settings in the ballpark for further customization . Just make sure the room is nice and quiet while the YPAO program is running . It does n't take long. < br />< br /> The companion app on my phone makes using everything on here a breeze . I use the app over my Harmony Ultimate for sheer ease of use and the feature set . I can tune in to internet radio of all sorts , to include scanner feeds ( I 'm a volunteer Firefighter / EMT so I enjoy listening to the radio traffic of big cities ) . I 've never been big on the multitude of DSP settings , but they 're there if you want them . The included remote does n't seem too bad , but I do n't use it . Honestly the app does everything I could possibly need it to , and in a more user friendly way. < br />< br /> Overall , I am impressed and very happy with the performance of this unit . With solid build quality , good looks , and great features , Yamaha has made a happy customer out of me.r />< br /> Overall , I am impressed and very happy with the performance of this unit .

I bought this for my mother who has a ton of gospel cassettes . It works like a charm , she loves it and has had no problem with it .

Out of the box I was n't 100 % sure how to use this or test it properly . So I asked a few friends that are much more versed in this area than I am . After they instructed me here is what I found . This little amplifier has two main uses , as a headphone amplifier and a stereo speaker amplifier . This being a bluetooth device I did everything through sync'ing and did n't use it as a direct port , however you can directly plug into it . This package comes with a 12V power cable that is needed for powering speakers . However if you want to use this amplifier for your headphones you can just use any usb cable . I know I barely even dove into the full potential of this device but what I did test it worked amazing . Sound quality is great , easy to use ( once you figure out what you are doing ) and super durable . It just has a great feel to it , like it 's going to actually last and not end up in the trash in a month or two. < br />< br /> I did receive this device at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review .#### #### ####[([57, 58], [154], 'POS'), ([149, 150], [152], 'POS'), ([156], [154], 'POS')]
Bought this to replace the cord for Summer Infant Monitor # 02330 ( the camera cord ) . This cord would not power the camera , if I applied pressure to the cord it would send power but otherwise would not continuously power . I then tried to use it to power the monitor itself and the same issue occurred. < br />< br /> Also , it should be noted that the adapter end for this cord is straight , probably 2-3 &# 34 ; long , while the factory adapter had an elbow , so if you have the camera hanging on the wall , this adapter will making hanging it very difficult as the adapter is straight while the factory adapter 's elbow allowed it to sit flush against the wall. < br />< br /> Returned this item the same day it was received .#### #### ####[([24], [21, 22], 'NEG')]

I bought these ear buds specifically for working out and running errands . For $ 8 , I would recommend these to anyone . The sound quality is pretty good for the price and they 've held up well , despite being yanked out of my ears multiple times for various reasons ( catching the cord on a door handle , my dog pulling them out when he 's excited , etc ) . I 've had problems in the past with other headphones where one of the earbuds dies while the other one still works , and I have not had that problem with these yet . I used to buy them at Target , where they were $ 15 , but I bought this pair in November 2014 and recently bought another pair in August 2015 because I lost the first pair . I use these with my ipod , multiple laptops , and my samsung galaxy S3 with no problems .

I purchased one of these in 2014 but did not try to use it until 8 / 2015 . First indication the LED light did not come on and there was no output . I have an amateur radio Extra Class license so I tried to find a schematic - no luck . I then opened the until and was shocked by the terrible quality . There ware big solder blobs in many places and splattered solder in many places on the circuit board . The solder resin was still there making it clear that the board had not been cleaned . I located the internal power supply and found it to be putting out 11.7 volts but I do not know if this is correct not having a schematic and not being able to determine what the IC 's were . There were only two IC 's and two transistors so even if this thing worked it would probably drift all over the place . Total piece of junk .

The wortst subwoofer I ever had . I asked questions on this page before purchasing this fridge . Dissapointment is an understatement. . I previously owned BIC 12 with blown amp . Luckily for me , someone got me a Gemini 15 &# 34 ; on craigslist for $ 120. . the sub performed very well till I got a new guy who occupied our basement . His bass was filling my room and I started swatching for a sub . I realized he was using 10 &# 34 ; klipsch synergy subwoofer . After doing all my research and reading reviews , I decided to give this Cerwin Vega a try . I was the most dissapointed man on earth . So amwthing came up mg mind and I used the Cerwin Vega amp for the BIC 12 . Amazingly , I was taken aback . The first time our landlord texted me to bring my music down . The Bass was crazy !! ! I mean crazy !! ! Wow !! ! I gambled and it worked . The system comprises of < br /> 1 . SONY TA-E9009ES PREAMP < br /> 2.EMOTIVA UPA-500 POWERED AMP < br /> 3 . MAC MINI with KODI software . Can enable pass through and stereo mix . Supports AC3. < br /> 4 . Speakers. . POLK RTI6 FOR CENTER SPEAKER < br /> 5 . POLK RTI6 FOR FRONT < br />& JBL ES30 FOR SURROUND. < br /> I will never purchase anything Cerwin Vega again ..... leasson learnt. .

This is the worst UPS I have ever purchased . When first plugged in a loud and obnoxious fan begins to run - this never ever stops even after the UPS batteries are charged ( 72 hours ) . A real treat is to be had when attempting to power it off . A very loud beeping occurs and does not stop . After reading the manual , there are several meanings to the word ' OFF ' .

This is my first pair of Bose headphones and the sound is amazing , true to the reputation of Bose . The sound is crisp and clear and these make me want to listen to music only with headphones on and to even watch movies and TV shows with them on. < br />< br /> They are comfortable both on the ear with soft cushions and on the top of the head due to another soft cushion where they sit on the top of your head . The ear phones fold so they can lie flat and can be stored and carried in the case which has a soft interior with stiff sides ( so they do not get crushed ) and the case has light padding on the exterior and closes with a zipper. < br />< br /> The full functionality is available when using these with Android devices ( as is clearly stated by Bose ) : for a phone call : answer a call , end a call , use voice control ; for media playing : play , pause , skip forward , and skip backward ; and increase and decrease volume . These also work for listening with Apple devices but the all the controls do not work on Apple devices ( as Bose states ) . I was able to get the pause to work with iPhone but nothing else . This is not a complaint I am just explaining that they do work to listen and pause on Apple devices. < br />< br /> I rate theses 5 stars = I Love It .#### #### ####[([10], [12], 'POS'), ([10], [24], 'POS'), ([10], [26], 'POS'), ([10], [109], 'POS')]

I expected them to be biases towards overpowering bass at a sacrifice of mids and highs like Sony MDRXB50AP Extra Bass , but no ! The sound signature is crystal clear and crisp . I ordered them together with Sennheiser CX 3.00 and Sennheiser CX 400-II in order to compare , and after a few days of testing with various music I decided to return both of Sennheiser 's earbuds and keep these awesome iBeats . They definitely produce a decent sound stage effect that is very comparable to Sennheiser . I mostly recommend them to people who listen to epic trailer music and electronic music like dubstep , but I 'm sure they will do great with other genres too. < br />< br /> Let 's talk about design , I confess that I fell for their look when I bought them , suspecting that they might disappoint me later .

I received my G1W-X yesterday , so my experience with it is not long . My purpose for writing a review is to , hopefully , help others who will have the same first impression I did : how do I return this ? Before you act on that thought , I ’d ask you to follow some straight-forward advice :< br /> 1 . The first thing to do after taking it out of the box is to install the micro SDHC card and power it up in your car . Do n’t do what I did and connect it to your PC via the USB cord expecting that it can be customized by doing this . The USB connection is only useful if you want to transfer the SDHC card files to your PC without having to extract the micro SDHC card. < br /> 2 . Stick it on the windshield having only powered it up with the card installed . Drive around for a few miles to get a decent sample of the recording and then transfer the recording to your PC to review what the default settings give you. < br /> 3 . Then , in your car , you can try alternative settings to see which ones you like best. < br />< br /> Note that the Parking Mode and Motion Detection options are incompatible with the normal use while driving . When selected , the camera does n’t automatically go into the drive mode and will result in the on / off cycling that others have commented on. < br />< br /> Having said this , I ’d recommend the camera to friends . The picture is high resolution and the 170 degree field of view is quite adequate . Four instead of five stars is only based on the lack of some plain language instructions being included . Hopefully you will be as happy with the camera as I am . If it holds up for a year or more , I ’d say my $ 55 investment was well worth it .#### #### ####[([229], [123], 'POS'), ([229], [232], 'POS'), ([229], [298], 'POS')]
This has got to be the best value of any Bluetooth speaker you will find out there . The bass is true and never distorts . The volume is amazing . It is worthy of the Bose brand . More things I like : It is very portable ( there are some great cases for it as well if you want to carry it around ) it looks cool , its very affordable , and last but not least - I have never had ANY bluetooth connection issues with this thing . It remembers a lot of devices and if they are on and nearby , it just works . No re-pairing and re-connecting , or turning your phones bluetooth off and on to get it to work . It just works .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [6], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [52], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [108], 'POS')]

I love this remote . I just wish I had purchased it sooner . For some reason I missed the fact that this unit has back-lit keys . I had held off buying it for this fact but to my pleasant surprise the buttons glow in the dark . I 've been able to consolidate about 4 remotes I had . The 650 is very easy to program using the application you can install on your PC . I have it successfully controlling my Intel NUC with Kodi installed , Denon Receiver , Samsung TV and my PS3 . The PS3 is bluetooth only so I had to buy the adapter . It converts an IR signal to bluetooth . The wife is also happy with this remote as it makes it so much easier for her to watch whatever she wants.If you are interested in the PS3 adapter it is sold here on Amazon . Look up &# 34 ; Logitech Harmony Adapter for Playstation 3 ,&# 34 ; and it should pull up . Its nice because you really just need one remote for all of your equipment . Now I can watch anything I want with a touch of a button . I dont think you can beat this product at this price point . They also have an active user forum on Logitech 's website for support issues . All in all a solid product and I highly recommend it .#### #### ####[([67], [65], 'POS'), ([67], [134], 'POS')]
I ordered a pair of this earbuds about a month ago to replace my old ones . The price was hard to beat and the reviews were really great. < br /> Last night ( August 29th ) , I noticed that the left part stopped working . I 've rotated things around and tried different things but it seems that it just stopped working . I had done no damage to these as I recall. < br /> I give 3 stars for the time it functioned - it was probably the best pair of earbuds you could get for the price , but had to take off 2 stars because it just simply stopped working , and I think I 've read other reviews that were similar to mine. < br /> It 's a shame because I really enjoyed listening to music with these earbuds .#### #### ####[([18], [20], 'NEU'), ([18], [93], 'NEU'), ([43, 44], [45, 46], 'NEU')]

I 've had this for about a year and a half now and it is holding up my 47 inches Vizio very well . Up until this morning I did n't realize it could get closer to the wall than I had it , and as a result it was tilting downwards . After doing some rearranging my bf put one hand on the left and right side of the TV and pushed it towards the wall , and I was pleasantly surprised to see the TV get closer to the wall . That was 12 hrs ago and the TV is n't tilting . I 'm happy with this item and would buy it again .#### #### ####[([18, 19], [22], 'POS')]

What can you say about such a simple device . It works . I plugged in the optical output from my Samsung 32 &# 34 ; TV and the audio output to an old Philips stereo . The audio quality is fine with no noticeable delay or lag . The only negative , and it 's a very small one , is that the blue LED power light on it is very bright . My setup is in a bedroom and I had to be careful to aim the LED downwards so it would not light up the room at night . Update 32 days after order received ( 2 days past Amazon return limit ) : it failed . It now only produces a loud oscillating noise whenever there is optical input !#### #### ####[([39], [41], 'NEU')]
I bought these headphones in 2011 . Used them 1-2 times per month on flights . Worked great for 4 years , and then they stopped working . Will not work at all with Noise Cancellation turned on .

We have several MP3 players , but his is the first one that has Bluetooth 3.0 capability and actually produces good BT sounds . This one is in the black & red color unit -- it plays MP3s and picks up radio stations quite nicely. < br />< br /> Tired of taking up storage space on your phone with your travel playlist ? Do what we are doing and transfer the music here , then use MediaMonkey to create the playlists. < br />< br /> The sound produced by this player is remarkably good , and my favorite pair of Brainwavz earphones sound fantastic with it . Just use your favorite earphones and listen to the difference they make !< br />< br /> When traveling , we use this to play music on the car stereo ... none of our cars have built-in BT , so we either have a BT receiver ( receives the music from the play and transmits the music to the radio via FM signal ) or we use a 3.5mm Aux cable to hook it directly to the car stereo . Either way , the music sounds great and I do not have to use my phone. < br />< br /> If you are looking for an MP3 & FM radio player of this size , style , construction and price , for use as I have described above , then we would recommend this player based on our experience with it. < br />< br /> Very recommended < br />< br /> Go for it. < br />< br /> We received this item gratis from the seller , without obligation , and decided to objectively test and review it . My statements in this Amazon listing 's review reflect that testing experience .#### #### ####[([21, 22], [20], 'POS'), ([21, 22], [105], 'POS')]

Worked nice for 6 months , after that it was absolutely dead . I supposed this is the average life span . I 've tried to change the battery but apparently you will need a little hand welder to do so , since the battery is firmly welded . I really enjoyed the product but do n't like the idea of having to have to get a new one instead of simply changing batteries . This is waste of money and valuable resources . I am looking now for a speaker that uses regular AA rechargeable batteries .#### #### ####[([44], [46, 47], 'NEU')]

This is a simple device - charge it up , wait til the light turns green , then use it as a nice portable battery pack for your other devices .

These ear buds are really nice for the price once you figure out the best way for you to use them . I have used Etymotic ear plugs for years so I can attend concerts and movies and work with power tools without doing any further damage to my ears so I know how to properly insert the 3 flanged buds . I tried both sizes of the 3 flanged tips but neither worked well . The sound was kind of tinny . Then I tried the foam tips . Wow . What a difference . For me the foam tips provide both the best noise isolation and the best sound quality .

Great headphone with mic but I see why it was discontinued . The newer PX 100-II i is better . The dual cables ( one from each earphone ) can feel restrictive and the microphone is a bit far from your head , making you want to hold it closer so people can hear you better . The PX 100-II i fixes both these drawbacks by placing the mic closer and using a single cable off the left side .#### #### ####[([22], [31], 'POS'), ([22], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([22], [69], 'POS'), ([34], [31], 'POS'), ([34], [38, 39], 'POS')]

The construction is pretty sturdy . It has been holding up my 60 inch plasma for a couple of month now . It would be an improvement if they made a slot / guide for the wire to go down the middle . Since the arms retract into the middle , the wire can get in the way when you push them in . The other complaint is screws for the tilt adjustment is hard to get to .

I bought this to replace a very old power strip and it has exceeded my expectations. < br />< br /> When plugging any outlets into the strip a bit of force is required . This is exactly what I had hoped for since my previous powerstrip was not adequately keeping devices plugged in. < br />< br /> The USB ports work as advertised and are a nice feature . They are separated from the rest of the plugs enough to not get in the way of any of the ac plugs .#### #### ####[([8, 9], [7], 'POS'), ([8, 9], [13], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [13], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [68], 'POS'), ([69], [13], 'POS'), ([69], [68], 'POS')]

We had the old sliding remote that broke a few years ago . Never got a replacement because we controlled everything with voice through the Xbox One . Got a new TV hooked up and moved this one to the bedroom , so we needed a new remote for the XVT553SV . This remote works perfectly with this model .

i am having an HDMI sync up issue in connecting the Sony 65 &# 34 ; tv ( XBR65x850C ) with Yamaha Aventage RX-A750 ( AV receiver ). i see that the HDMI out of the AV receiver is not detected by the TV . There is a specific power cycle pattern to be followed in order to get the AV receiver set up screen on to the TV.I am able to connect a Laptop to the HDMI of the TV and it works . I think Yamaha and Sony has to work together to resolve this issue other wise they may loose their customers.I am seeing some of the forums already started discussing this issues . Step 1 : unplug the TV Step 2 : Wait for couple of seconds ( looks wired .) Step 3 : Turn on XBR65X850C Step 4 : Go to settings and select HDMI4 / ARC input Step 4 : Turn ON the Yamaha RX-A750 Step 5 : You will see the Piano screen on to the TV In any case do not turn off the AV receiver . As long as u dont turn off you wull get the AV output on to TV . if you turn off the AV receiver then u have to repeat the above steps once again Note : Turning off the TV remote is not sufficient . We need to unplug the Sony TV from its supply mains .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [7], 'NEG'), ([36, 37], [39, 40], 'NEG'), ([36, 37], [227, 228], 'NEG'), ([182, 183], [227, 228], 'NEG'), ([32, 33], [39, 40], 'NEG'), ([32, 33], [227, 228], 'NEG')]

The 7.2 in the receiver means your neighbor will file complaints ! I got two of these bad boys . One is primarily used for pleasure , the other for &# 34 ; call the cops I do n't give a damn !&# 34 ; On a serious note , these speakers are very well made . Strong speakers and powerful amplifier . Do not place them close to windows . The rattling can sound as loud as the bass . Because of my limited options to place the subs , one has knobs at the 11 o'clock position , and the other at 1 o'clock . Solid bass !! ! Not as big as people make them out to be .

A great pair of Bluetooth wireless headphones . I have a pair of Beats Wireless ear buds as well , and compared to them the sound quality here is slightly inferior . However , the function is great , fit is good , and prices is about 75 % less ... making these great headphones ! The key advantage of these Photives is that they are truly sweat proof , unlike the Beats . Check for product reviews on Amazon and Apple.com , and many Beats wireless earbud owners complain that they stop working if they get sweat on them ( which happened to mine after having for 1 month - Apple Store gave me a new pair , as they do everyone for the first year ... and the same thing happened again ) .

If you intend to use this in the gym or run with it , avoid at all costs . Save up more money and buy a better model. < br />< br /> Issues :< br />< br />( 1 ) Cheap cord transmits bass noise into headphones . It 's not possible to run with these ... I 've bought cheaper headphones before where when the you run and bounce , and the cord slaps on your back , it transmits some bass into the headphones . These Senbowe have the worst of this effect I 've ever heard . It 's so bad it actually dwarfs the music. < br />< br />( 2 ) Thick cheap cord - the cord is heavy and thick . It does n't lay evenly across your neck - half of it hangs in the air awkwardly because it 's so thick and stiff. < br />< br />( 3 ) Very uncomfortable earpieces . These are the cheapest rubber I 've seen in earbuds among the dozen or so I 've bought from Amazon . They will stay in your ears - at the exchange of comfort. < br />< br /> I have to return these given how crazy loud the noise they make when you jog .#### #### ####[([119], [124], 'NEG'), ([161], [124], 'NEG'), ([161], [160], 'NEG'), ([161], [41], 'NEG'), ([161], [126], 'NEG'), ([161], [166], 'NEG'), ([122], [124], 'NEG'), ([122], [41], 'NEG'), ([122], [126], 'NEG')]

I am absolutely impressed by the quality sound that radiates from such a compact package . After reading reviews I was expecting good sound but never in my life would I have expected it to be this high in quality. < br /> It was very easy to pair with both my phone and my laptop as well as my Ipod and the improvement it makes to my laptop that even has beats audio is astounding . The fact that you can use a sd card as well as the included Aux cord makes using this speaker super simple < br /> It is just the right size to make it easily portable in my daily bag I take with to work . I work on a loud bus as a part time monitor for a pre school and this has given to me the ability to play children 's music through my Ipod for the children to enjoy during their ride . This being so much safer than running a aux code over a seat . This would make the perfect gift for any music lover out there who enjoys great sound while working out,working on crafts or in the man cave.The added light show during music play is very nice and rather fun to watch in a dim lit room .

I got these to replace my 23 year old L100T3 speakers . Though the L100s still sounded great , I figured it was just a matter of time until the sound deteriorated . The L890s have that classic JBL sound that I love . These go well with the S-Center and S36 's in my home theater system ( the drivers appear identical ) . They sound great listening to rock , jazz , and folk music . When watching movies , they deliver the goods - with good deep bass when the movie has it ( like chapter 23 in Independence Day when the aliens begin the attack on earth ).< br />< br /> JBL delivers once again .

OK for the price . It is the flimsiest device I ever saw . It was damaged during transport , two strips of aluminum that connect to the cable , were carelessly bent right where there was a hole for a screw attachment , to fit in the package . They broke as I tried to straighten them . I am handy , I was able to fix them . Whoever packaged it , could have bent it elsewhere , not at its weakest spot , and make the bend rounded , not sharp . Poorly trained and supervised , irresponsible . The product was damaged by the seller at shipment time. < br /> You really have to handle it extremely carefully , this thing bends if you stare at it . Just a notch above aluminum foil. < br /> The motorized function is useless , and annoying at best . You can never guess in which direction the antenna will turn when you push the button . It also moves too fast for basic accuracy. < br /> The price is cheap however , and it gets a reasonably good reception. < br /> I 'm bracing for the coming windy season .#### #### ####[([3], [8], 'NEG'), ([3], [184], 'NEG'), ([3], [192], 'NEG'), ([23], [32], 'NEG'), ([23], [146], 'NEG'), ([23], [149], 'NEG'), ([89], [32], 'NEG'), ([89], [90], 'NEG'), ([89], [146], 'NEG'), ([89], [149], 'NEG'), ([143, 144], [32], 'NEG'), ([143, 144], [90], 'NEG'), ([143, 144], [93], 'NEG'), ([143, 144], [146], 'NEG'), ([143, 144], [149], 'NEG')]

It 's the exact same as the cords that come with Beats the first time you buy them , same length and everything . It 's made out of a slightly different material , but looks just like how it 's pictured , the color is the same and it even has the little Beats logo on the part that goes into your devices .

When they work , they work well ; comfy , good quality , and great microphone connectivity. < br /> Try as I might , though , I just ca n't get them to work consistently . These go through long periods of time where the sound just breaks up , like a cell phone call going through a tunnel . It will be crystal clear for a few seconds , then become completely garbled , even if I have n't moved at all in relation to the receiver .

I live 65 miles from nearest broadcast tower . I tried a small antenna without an amplifier but only got 2 channels . I live in the mountains so I knew this was a challenge but I purchased the Channel Master CM-7777 and installed it . To my surprise ..... I was able to get 20 channels on the small antenna .

Owned the device for a week , where I put it though my busy schedule and quite a bit of bumping and thumping , and the build performed flawlessly . Bluetooth pairing was a breeze , and I loved the fact you can do everything with 3 buttons -- did n't need to look at the device a single time in that whole week since I could do everything just by tact . This was a huge plus for me . It 's also incredibly portable , just a little fatter than a thick cell phone case and grippy enough to carry in one hand . If you like turtles , you 'll like this cute little box . However ...< br />< br /> I tested it out-of-the-box , and connectivity was n't the best -- at times sound would cut out and it would n't be as clear as it could have . Sound issues were mostly resolved after a full charge , but the Bluetooth range was n't as good as advertised , much less so when there were walls or even minor obstructions between the device and the turtle . I would have easily overlooked these issues if the speaker 's max volume had been louder . It 's really nice that it 's sensitive and the volume is very gradual ( great for night-time jams ) , but another 10 or so points of volume would have made me keep it . To be fair , the speaker is small , and I 'd be playing it in the car with the window down . I thought the speaker volume was adequate inside a room . But I did n't buy the speaker for my room , I bought it to bring with me on my adventures , for which unfortunately it was n't loud enough . I was sad to return it :(#### #### ####[([26], [28], 'POS'), ([26], [254], 'POS'), ([30, 31], [34], 'POS'), ([30, 31], [169, 170], 'POS')]

It took me an hour of poking around all over my computer to realize the software was hidden inside the drives . I found it under &# 34 ; My Computer &# 34 ; and then had to open the file and choose SET UP .

Ive had the 3050 for a month . First of all it has excellent stability including copnnecting to Airplay , net radio , bluetooth and every device Ive thrown at it . After having a Denon that was quirky , glitchy and unstable all the time I 'm super happy with this . Denon should exit the market until they get fully functional stable products . The yamaha updated nicely when updating the software. < br /> The control app is smooth works well and intuitively . Both the app and the onscreen display are helpful with ease of use for all zones . The amplifiers work well with excellent sound quality . I formerly bought high end Denon ( and I mean never again ) that dont sound as clear and uncolored as these amplifiers . So all in all its a thrill to use with great software . The ability to adjust sound programs , tone or go direct via remote app is actually useful and fun to adjust for old recordsing and the like . ,#### #### ####[([148], [147], 'POS'), ([148], [13], 'POS'), ([148], [95], 'POS'), ([14], [147], 'POS'), ([14], [13], 'POS'), ([14], [95], 'POS'), ([20, 21], [166], 'POS'), ([78, 79], [81], 'POS'), ([78, 79], [95], 'POS'), ([92, 93], [81], 'POS'), ([92, 93], [95], 'POS')]

Unfortunately it was VERY cheaply made , and when it arrived I discovered it was n't actually designed to be bolted into a standard 19 &# 34 ; rack ( unlike the claims in the listing . ) We 've used Tripp Lite products in every data center I 've ever set foot in , so I paid the upcharge for this one .

Worst product I have ever bought off amazon by far . The splitter does not work as advertised .

I bought these for my granddaughter 's age 3 and 7 . The 3 yr old had the ear cushions off within the first hour , they stayed on my older grand daughters about a week . They are a pain to put back on . There is also not a volume stop on these . We constantly had to keep checking on how loud the volume was to prevent any ear damage . I would have returned them both but the ear pieces went missing. < br /> The headphones themselves arte a sturdy plastic and fit on both of the kids fine . These may be okay for tweens and teens but I definitely would not recommend them for small children .#### #### ####[([19], [20], 'NEG'), ([18, 19], [20], 'NEG'), ([82, 83], [20], 'NEG')]

Sounds lovely for the FM Stereo Band , which is primarily why I got it . Works well with receiving air / ground and AM Band transmissions , what little is still on the AM Band , anyway . Shortwave reception has been spotty , but that 's more than likely because I lack a decent shortwave antenna. < br />< br /> The only negative is it 's a bit of a power hog : 2300 mah batteries only seem to last for about 20 ~ 22 hours before their completely drained , and using the wall wart power adapter causes too much interference to rely on for primary power. < br />< br /> Wish I 'd know about Tecsun radios earlier .

Good sound quality . Really excellent to be able to watch movies with wireless ability . We liked the first pair so much that we ordered and second . Will be ordering a bluetooth splitter so that my husband and I can both watch the same movie at the same time with these headphones , without disturbing the neighbors later in the evening .

Quite pleased with this purchase . I needed a solid pair of cans to travel with and use around the house when I 'm not near my main rig . Did n't want to spend too much as they are driven by my iPhone or computer . These hit just the right balance between price and performance . I prefer the Grado SR255 and the Grado sound generally , but they are open back and not useful if there is someone else nearby . The Sennheisers are darn close though . Much more bass in the Sennheisers than the Grados , which I found quite surprising . Highs are great as expected and the midrange solid .

I work in a lab where we have alarms going off all the time . I can still hear the alarms but they 're significantly muted . In that environment I like to use the noise cancellation without listening to music , so there 's no need for the cable , giving me freedom of movement. < br /> When I first put them on I got a little dizzy -- maybe because my inner ear / balance mechanism was confused ? But after a short while that problem went away. < br /> I 've noticed that it seems to completely block out continuous background noises like fans for example . Otherwise , it just really mutes noises. < br /> I cannot overstate the value of having the extension cord unplug from * both * ends -- I 've walked away from my computer before and forgot to take off my headphones and it just unplugs from the headphone side instead of ripping the wire out like on other headphones . These are also the most comfortable headphones I 've ever owned -- I can wear them for hours straight . I cannot wear them all day long but I can wear them for about four hours before I feel a need to hear stuff .#### #### ####[([75], [25], 'POS'), ([75], [80], 'POS'), ([75], [178], 'POS'), ([77, 78], [80], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [80], 'POS')]

I have been using wired headsets that were not much cheaper , but the cords / wires keep going bad and I go through one about every three months as I work from home and have a lot of conference calls . This Bluetooth headset has been great . Sound clarity is perfect . Range is incredible , as it has worked through two floors when I forgot to turn it off one time . I have it connected to a work phone ( LG Vista 3 ) and a personal cell phone ( Samsung Galaxy Note 4 ) . So far , I have had no issues . I charge it at least every other day but that is because I 'm on it all the time . Battery life seems very solid , though . It uses a standard USB , so easy to charge whenever / wherever you need it . Very comfortable to wear . *** Updated 09 / 16 / 2015 - I really liked the feel and sound of this headset but six weeks in and it no longer accepts a charge .

Grandpa here ... This is a 9 month update on our purchase of the MiPow Bluetooth Wireless LED Playbulb . We have had ample time to use this product in many areas and fascists of our daily family life. < br />< br /> Replacing the Playbulb with our normal LED light bulb from our deck light , we then enjoy music from our tablets out on the deck during a nice spring or summer day . As well as enjoying music while we are doing our gardening . The Playbulb is plenty loud enough to be heard all over the deck and into the garden . But not loud enough that the neighbors can hear it or complain about it . This will not rock the house down if that is what you are looking for . But if you are looking for something like background music level from say a waiting room , yet a tad louder . Than this Playbulb works out well . The light is a bright white , not a yellow white , and we had almost no bug activity around the LED light at night . Over all , this Playbulb has worked well as our out door bluetooth source for music. < br />< br /> Replacing the Playbulb with our normal LED light bulb from the bathroom . Well lets just say the wife no longer takes 20 minute baths , she now takes two hour baths almost . As she will get lost in her music while soaking in her lavender tub . The music is plenty loud enough for a bathroom due to all the reflective properties found within the room . Loud enough that I can hear it at times down the hall in the bedroom even with the bathroom door closed . In a small space , and a highly reflective place , the Playbulb comes through in good sound quality . Again , this is not going to rock the house down . The white of the LED light can be a bit bright in the bathroom , especially because the light hangs in front of the mirror . We normally prefer the yellow LED light as it is softer on our eyes , but to each their own. < br />< br /> Replacing the Playbulb with our normal LED light bulbs from either our bedroom or the daughters . In both rooms the sound was good being they were being a material lamp shade which can absorb the sound . They sound like a good clock radio that one might play in their bedroom to give an idea of the sound level and quality . Like the other locations , the Playbulb will not rock the house down . But in the bedroom , I would recommend two Playbulbs , one for each side of the bed . For having them in stereo they would produce a much better sound quality that evenly distributes itself throughout the room . Being the bedrooms are bigger than the bathroom , and less reflective . The Playbulb is not as loud in the bedroom compared to the bathroom . But this can be solved by using two Playbulbs. < br />< br /> We were not paid nor discounted in any way , shape or form for giving our honest opinion here of this product as a review to assist others . We believe , as a family , it is important to give an honest and accurate review to assist others so they can make good purchasing decisions that can benefit them and their family . And not be lead to cheap , unwanted purchases that are scripted by advertisers to buy their products . We are a family that believes in a minimalist lifestyle while trying to be green as much as possible in all departments of our life . As we care to leave something , anything , of this planet to our grandchildren so they may enjoy it as we have.rial lamp shade which can absorb the sound .

Noise cancelling is best in the business . Scary how good it works . I got these so drown out the sound of my wife watching TV while I work at the computer and they do an amazing job . My wife has to wave at me to get my attention when I 'm wearing these which is espicially impressive when you consider that I listen to them at a low volume . Excellent sound quality . I hear things with these bose headphones I never noticed with the Beats Studios I had before . Bass does not hit as hard as Beats , but that is to be expected with Bose . Bose is much more about delivering a full and rich experience across the entire sound spectrum where as Beats are more about delivering hard hitting lows .#### #### ####[([75], [122], 'POS'), ([75], [73], 'POS'), ([0, 1], [3], 'POS')]

Pros :< br /> 1 . Both product and firmware interface designs are very nice. < br /> 2 . Automatic pause / resume when headphone is plugged out / in. < br /> 3 . Capacity support up to 128GB with micro SD card. < br /> 4 . Sound quality is very good. < br /> 5 . Packaging is amazing . The player comes with screen protector already applied. < br /> Also includes extra screen protectors , silicone case , some stickers. < br />< br /> Cons :< br /> 1 . Difficult to create playlists on player / PC both. < br /> 2 . Does not support ' Folder Play ' . ( Said to be fixed with later firmware )< br /> 3 . There is a limit of 5800 songs for the Library . This limits the songs ( if over 5800 ) to be shown on the list < br /> when you browse songs by artist , album , genre , etc . ( you can still browse all the songs with folder browse. )< br /> It is said that there would be a new firmware update ( which they are testing it now ) that fixes this limitation issue. < br /> Release scheduled within 2015 I guess. < br /> 4 . With 128GB capacity support , you can put over 10000 songs but when try to load a folder with too many songs ,< br /> or a playlist with lots of songs , the loading takes very long time. < br />< br /> Why I chose this player was because of its design , so I am happy with the purchase < br /> but I hope they fix the above problems on the new firmware .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [97], 'POS')]
This 3 in 1 Version 1.4 HDMI Male to Male Cable with Micro and Mini HDMI Adapters could n't have come at a better time . We recently got a mini projector and needed an HDMI cable for it to connect from the projector to our extra Roku . The cable feels very well-made and the adapters feel like they are pretty secure when added onto the cable . It 's a good length cable at 5 feet so there 's plenty of room to play with. < br />< br /> When we tried it out , as mentioned earlier , we used it with our mini projector that we recently purchased . It was easy to connect both projector and Roku to the cable . Our Roku is set at 1080p and the projector was able to project the image at 1080p onto the wall . The image produced was clear and surpassed our expectations . We moved the cables around a little while running it to be sure they stayed secure and stayed in place and there were no interruptions which , to me , indicates it 's a good cable . The adapters are a great addition to this cable since many different devices use different methods of connecting . Because we now have them on hand , we know we will be prepared if needed . This cable can also be used for many other things , such as , game consoles , computers , and other electronics . Overall , I 'm very happy we got this HDMI cable . It has worked out perfectly for our needs and we plan to make this our go-to HDMI cable now that we will be using our projector often. < br />< br /> I received this product at a discount so that I may test it out and write an honest , unbiased product review .

I really enjoy my P5 ( original version , not Mk 2 ) headphones . They isolate well , but not to the exclusion of important sounds like car horns . They are beautifully crafted and about as comfortable as a pair of on-ears is capable of feeling . There sound is not overstated in any respect - the highs are true without being harsh at all , and details are very clear and have depth . Bass is also accurate and appropriate - Beats lovers need not apply . I listen to them primarily with my Pono Player , and they match up well . They work well in my intended use of travel and outside the home use .#### #### ####[([77], [82], 'POS'), ([77], [80], 'POS'), ([59], [61], 'POS'), ([97, 98], [72], 'POS'), ([97, 98], [108], 'POS')]

I ended up in a bit of a bind while trying to hook up a record player to a receiver . The cable for the player was too short and I was hesitant to cut the turntable cable . Thankfully , Amazon pulled through with one-day shipping and I got it all set up ! No issues so far ! The cable itself seems pretty standard . I felt I got my money 's worth !< br />< br /> Honestly , I was concerned about ordering a product with zero reviews .

These are wonderful for quiet . I have new noisy neighbors who play loud music until all hours . With the Bose QC25s on , I do n't hear a thing. < br />< br /> To the people who have said they do n't work for this , be sure the battery is installed in the correct orientation , has a charge , the battery compartment is closed , and the tiny power switch is in the On position . If the switch is n't On , they do nothing. < br />< br /> At first the headband felt uncomfortable , but i got used to it in an hour or two .#### #### ####[([66], [57], 'POS'), ([66], [68], 'POS'), ([66], [101], 'POS'), ([52], [57], 'POS'), ([65, 66], [68], 'POS'), ([65, 66], [101], 'POS'), ([99], [101], 'POS')]

I returned the first one because base music sounds were terribly distorted -- sounding like the &# 34 ; blown &# 34 ; speaker in my old pickup . Assuming the speaker was &# 34 ; blown &# 34 ; I ordered an replacement . But the replacement had the same distortion issue . The FM antenna pulled in stations well , and the tuning did not wonder off the station as some radios do . The sound quality of talk stations was fine , but the sound quality of music was far below acceptable .#### #### ####[([88], [83], 'NEG'), ([88], [11], 'NEG'), ([88], [19], 'NEG'), ([88], [36], 'NEG'), ([23], [19], 'NEG'), ([31], [19], 'NEG'), ([31], [36], 'NEG'), ([55, 56], [83], 'NEG'), ([55, 56], [11], 'NEG'), ([64], [36], 'NEG'), ([77, 78], [83], 'NEG'), ([77, 78], [11], 'NEG'), ([87, 88], [36], 'NEG')]

Here is my review after two days with the new portable mp3 / fm player . Pro : 1 ) Low price . 2 ) Auto scan Fm station . 3 ) Use as time display unit . Alarm clock and sleep timer 0-60 minutes . 4 ) Pocket size with speaker . Cons : 1 ) No bluetooth or aux input . 2 ) Cheap small speaker sound below normal ( distorted on high volume level ) . 3 ) No auto return to display present time in Fm mode ( show and lock on station Hz ) or in mp3 mode ( show only each song playing time ) . Any giving time If I look at the display I do want to see the present time . 4 ) Request 18650 battery with pigtail wire . Even you find the battery but how to charger the spare . 5 ) Request charge the battery more oven . Play time last only four to five hours the most . 9-7-2015 update . I Keep it charge over night . I am afraid the alarm clock may not work next morning . The play time only last four hours . They large display did use all the battery power . I am not recommend any one to buy this unit . If the unit cost over $ 20 I will return it for refund . The look and size I like it so much I keep it around .#### #### ####[([61], [57], 'NEU'), ([21], [20], 'NEU'), ([67, 68], [72], 'NEU'), ([203], [202], 'NEU'), ([239], [202], 'NEU'), ([239], [241], 'NEU'), ([237], [241], 'NEU')]
It works . It actually works . I have had three others , all different brands . They simply did not work . This one does and what 's more it allows me to use more than one bluetooth source .

Good headphones for the price . If you want good bass response from an in-ear headphones , I would recommend these . The overall sound quality is equivalent or better than the Beats headphones I tested out during my search . Since purchasing the xtc 's , I have not used used my $ 100 sol republic v10 headphones . Would give a 5 star , but I need to see how long the xtc 's will last .

Makes my phone lock up when using the camera !! ! When it does this , the only way to get restarted is to pull battery out and reset .

I was looking for a pair of corded noise cancelling headphones for a flight that I have coming up , and seeing the these guys we only $ 60 seemed like a steal to the point in which I was almost suspicious . However , my fears were put aside when the headphones came out of the box very solid , and not nearly as ostentatious as some of the other headphones in the same category . And they may be the best fitting over the eat phones that I 've worn in a long time ... I 've been able to fall asleep with them on on more than one occasion , and that 's a testament to how comfortable they are. < br />< br /> As far as the sound quality goes , I do n't have much to compare it to as the rest of my cans are BT , however the drivers on these can get very loud without leaking noise , and the noise cancelling does exactly what I needed them to do . Now , there 's no way I 'd buy them for retail , but at $ 60 , I do n't care if I have the newest version of the headphones , you 're simply not going to get this kind of quality , or indeed this type of noise cancelling in headphones that inexpensive . Jump on it while you still have the chance !#### #### ####[([83], [82], 'POS'), ([83], [162], 'POS'), ([132, 133], [82], 'POS'), ([230], [162], 'POS')]

I initially received a defective cable . It had a loose connection within one of the RCA plugs and the sound cut out intermittently . The replacement cable works fine and sounds great . Noticeably smoother and with better detail than the CablesOnline 1ft and 2ft Male to Male Premium RCA cables I also bought . I also have the Monoprice Premium RCA 's and various Blue Jean and KnuKonzept cables . The KabelDirekts are , sound wise , the best budget RCA cables I own . They come very , very close to my Audioquest Sydney cables , which go for something like $ 160 . The reason I did n't give them five stars is because of the defective cables I received and the fact that the RCA plugs fit very loosely , they pull out very easily if you even touch the cable . With cable comparisons things are system dependent . What sounds good in one system may not sound so good in another . It all depends on the individual components you 're connecting and their interaction with any given cable .#### #### ####[([16, 17], [10], 'POS'), ([16, 17], [133], 'POS'), ([20], [10], 'POS'), ([20], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([20], [133], 'POS'), ([39], [38], 'POS')]

While it 's clear these headphones deliver crisp sound and good bass for a fantastic price , I find that the shape of the earbud itself causes me some discomfort .

I needed this as a space-saver for my power filter , which was having trouble fitting into my audio cabinet . I run my coax cables from my roof antenna,and although I do have other power arresting measures in place , I also use the built-in coax surge protection .

Putting in a 90 degree bend saves me maybe 3 / 4 &# 34 ; , just the space I needed to make my gear fit in a tight spot. < br />< br /> I did n't notice any unusual signal loss or anything .

These are probably the best earbuds I have used . They fit snugly and the funny outer design seems to help hold them in place , not just look odd . The side control does a good job for pausing and volume control with my iPod . And the clip on the cord has so far held the cord to my shirt without breaking . The biggest plus for these earphones , however , is the sound . The special buds nicely close off the ear canal so that the outer world accounts for about 10 % of your sound which means you can listen at a significantly lower volume and still get a fuller sound than with traditional iPod earbuds . My only caution would be not to wear these while driving as your hearing will be significantly more tuned to the music and you do n't want to miss anything going on outside the car !#### #### ####[([11], [4], 'POS'), ([32, 33], [114], 'POS'), ([32, 33], [36], 'POS'), ([32, 33], [67], 'POS'), ([49, 50], [63], 'POS')]

Best mounts I could find for my bookshelf speakers. < br />< br /> I 'm using Polk T15s (~ 7 lbs each ) as my L,R , and surrounds , and they are all hung from my ceiling .

They have a safety cable so that if the joint ever did give out , your speaker wo n't fall to the floor . I mounted them with 2 # 10 screws into a stud , and 2 # 10 screws into drywall anchors .

Great sound for the size and price . Clear mid-range but I personally did n't feel the bass was that great . But then again the price is very reasonable . It does n't compare to my Bose Soundlink bass-wise but it 's one-third the price so it should not be compared to it . It does get loud . I really appreciate the size . I take it to work with my iPad since it sounds so much better than the cheap boom-box they provided . I put it in my lunch bag and it fits . One thing and it has nothing to do with this review . The outside packing box was in good shape but the plastic packaging around the speaker was shattered and the speaker had scuff marks all over it . They did come off with some rubbing with a cloth but what the heck happened ? The speaker really took a beating and still worked properly . It paired up so easy . Not sure if I like the human voice but you get a little instrument to change the voices or use just a tone . Anyway it 's a great deal .#### #### ####[([26], [29], 'POS'), ([26], [162], 'POS'), ([121], [126], 'POS'), ([121], [162], 'POS'), ([6], [116], 'POS'), ([6], [0], 'POS'), ([6], [62], 'POS'), ([64], [116], 'POS'), ([64], [0], 'POS'), ([64], [62], 'POS'), ([4], [116], 'POS'), ([4], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [62], 'POS')]

poor sound quality only because it wont fit tightly and closely in the ear .

I wanted to extend my headphones for my Mac Pro at work and still be able to use the microphone and volume buttons on my Apple or Bose earbuds . This works perfectly , but note that you need to have the headphones plugged in to the cord BEFORE you plug it in to the computer or the buttons / mic wo n't work .

First let me say that I do n't consider myself an audiophile . But these speakers impressed me for what they are . I placed them on opposite ends of my pool ( 40 feet probaby ) and about 50 feet away from the amplifier on some cheap 16 gauge speaker wire . At about half volume on my Sony 100 watt receiver they nicely fill the space with surprisingly well rounded sound . The bass is not that great , but what do you expect from 5.25 &# 34 ; speaker . Overall I 'm very pleased . They look nice , are pretty heavy , and sound good .#### #### ####[([15], [16], 'POS'), ([72], [16], 'POS'), ([72], [109], 'POS'), ([75], [77, 78], 'POS')]

As a musician who recorded and mixed a CD ([[ ASIN : B00O30WYCU Foreign Skies ]]) using the CX 300 ii , I can say these are definitely worth the money . For sure you can get better quality for a higher price . But these are clean , have excellent sound isolation , more than enough bass ( I listen on flat in iTunes , whereas the CX 300 pushing up the bass and treble - i.e. the ' rock ' setting gave the best setting ) , and are very comfortable. < br />< br /> I 'm listening to the Cardigans and hearing violins in the background I never knew were there :) .

Awesome Speaker ! It pairs to my phone with ease and with the plug , it works with my friends I-Pod too . You can feel the bass and when you turn it up all the way , there 's no distortion . It was originally $ 99 but I got it on sale for $ 59 and free shipping . So I got a really super good deal for a speaker with this much sound . I Love It !

I think the sound comes through slightly fuzzy , but it does n't seem to bother my younger kids much at all . Also , the padding covering the earpieces comes off pretty easily . It 's fairly difficult to get back on , but can be done with a little patience . We use these with the built in entertainment system in our Honda Odyssey . Obviously , these headphones are lower quality than the additional ones we can purchase at the dealership , but those are over $ 140 apiece . These are a fantastic deal for the price .

Read carefully these are not noise cancelling you can hear all outside noise . The volume overall is low and i dont know what extra base there talking about because there is barely a difference when you boost it .

When I first got the horn of death , I had to guess what it was altering me to because there were no instructions included with this product . However , it IS a self-explanatory device , so I immediately surmised that it was the low battery signal . This was very confusing to me because my device had never been operated on battery power . It has been plugged in the entire time . I cycled the power off and let out sit overnight , unplugged . The next day I tried to operate it on battery power alone only to get the HOD . So , I cycled the power back off , plugged the device in for several hours and , lo and behold , the ever-present HOD was STILL ever-present. < br />< br /> I have since tried various combinations of charging , discharging , rebooting , etc. , and on rare occasions my Titan will act as if nothing ever happened ... glaring at me from the corner the way second ex wife would when I brought up a one of her indescretions that we had already &# 34 ; worked through. &# 34 ; I 'm not saying this Titan speaker is a b ! tch , but between the inexplicable energy drain , the incessant complaining about not being fulfilled and increasingly rare moments of pleasurable co-existence , it 's kind of making the case for itself .

I am just a home owner with minimal recharging requirements for my home , with only two people living here . The product worked great for just over a year when it began to display different and ever changing charging data and would no-longer charge the batteries . At first I thought it may be the batteries , but after buying several sets of good batteries , I determined that the La Crosse BC1000 was defective and would no longer charge any size of batteries . I checked the La Crosse ’s web site only to find out that the warranty was one ( 1 ) year from the date of purchase , which is just a little less than a year if you figure in the order / delivery time. < br />< br /> LaCrosse Technology has some very excellent product ideas , but I have found that the durability / quality of their products is lacking . If they would only spend a very small percentage more to give their products the quality and durability required for customer satisfaction , I believe that their sales would increase dramatically . Expect less than two years of service from this product , if you take care of it by unplugging it whenever it is not in use , use a surge protector and clean it . I loved it when it was working , but it should have lasted much longer the way that I take care of equipment .#### #### ####[([46], [158], 'NEG'), ([153], [158], 'NEG'), ([221, 222], [158], 'NEG'), ([151], [158], 'NEG')]

I have tried several different pillow speakers . I have a bad habit of needing to listen to TALKING as I go to sleep ( music does n't work for me ) to keep my mind from wandering and anxiety from taking over . Unfortunately , my husband is not keen on talk radio or books on tape as background noise ! Enter the pillow speaker. < br />< br /> I have purchased two of these speakers ; one to keep in my travel bag ( so I never forget and am without it ) and one to use nightly in bed . I plug it into my iPhone , set it to play for about an hour , and at some point , drift off peacefully. < br />< br /> It might be a bit princess-and-the-pea of me , but I do n't use the squishy cover that comes with it . I find that too lumpy under the pillow , causing pressure on my ear . The device inside is quite flat and functions perfectly without the extra &# 34 ; pillow. &# 34 ; The sound quality is excellent and because I can put my ear directly over the speaker , it does n't need to be loud enough for anyone else to hear .#### #### ####[([191], [193], 'POS'), ([149], [148], 'POS')]

Easy to run , nice and clean install . Make sure where you mount it you have a 7 / 16 hole for the stud , the insulators on the fire ring are made to locate in a 7 / 16 hole . My big complaint is the connector . The solder on connector is insulated with bake-lite , or at least looks like it , and it broke the first time I plugged it into a radio . RG58 cable is more difficult to find connectors for . I had to drive an hour to find a new connector and RG58 adapter .

This is a super comfortable and portable headset that I 'm using with both my iPhone 6 Plus phone and my Chromebook . The sound quality is far superior to the iPhone earbuds that come with the phone ( and they do n't hurt like the new ear bud design does !) . I noticed a small amount of crackling noise when I rotated the jack in the phone port , but it went away after a couple of uses . The microphone is crisp and superior to the earbuds that come with an iPhone . I could n't get the headset controls to increase or decrease the volume . I have to use my phone or Chromebook for that . That 's the only downside when compared to using iPhone earbuds which can pause / restart as well as adjust volume .

When I first got my speakers I was really bummed to find that I was missing a wire and had an extra one that connected the two speakers . I found a replacement for the missing wire and plugged them into my computer , only to find that the second speaker did not make any noise . I returned them in hopes of getting working ones . When I opened the new water speakers the second speaker was still not making sound and the first speaker was making a rattling noise . I am considering returning them a second time but worry that the new speakers will yet have another problem . The only reason it gets two stars is because the woking speaker was actually cool .#### #### ####[([123], [15], 'NEG'), ([123], [35], 'NEG'), ([123], [79], 'NEG'), ([123], [126], 'NEG')]

i can say that this is the best BT headphone i ever used . I was impressed that audio quality for is identical for cable connection . I had Harman BT ant the sound was very LOW. < br /> the bass was great and i was expecting low bass since it has sensitivity 98 db compared to my V-moda M-100 ( 105 db )< br />< br /> Cons : Great Bass specially in deep bass ( thanx to the frequency response 4 khz - 100 khz ) , Crisp sound , High BT Volume , Design and Color , Touch Control < br />< br /> Pros : Lot of Plastics , Low db ( leads to little bit low bass ) but it still there good bass , Touch Control lag ( need to re-connect BT ) , High Price for plastic looks premium .#### #### ####[([18, 19], [128], 'POS'), ([18, 19], [43], 'POS'), ([33], [133], 'POS'), ([41], [128], 'POS'), ([41], [43], 'POS'), ([41], [71], 'POS')]

Update from Jan 2016 :< br /> I worked with Eric at Maha customer support and they replaced my defective unit under warranty back in August / Sept. of 2015 . The replacement unit is working fine and is a quality product . While not completely pain free , Maha did what they promised and I appreciate a company that stands behind their products . I will buy from them again , and highly recommend you give them a look if you need their products. < br /> I will be increasing my rating to 4 stars. < br />< br /> Just an update :< br />< br /> I purchased this from Amazon in May 2014 . It has performed really well and would normally recommend this to everyone . However , it has stopped working this week . It comes with a 3 year warranty and I am attempting to get it replaced under that warranty. < br />< br /> I will update this review based upon the response I get from Maha .#### #### ####[([35], [36], 'POS')]

The best athletic wired ( non-bluetooth ) earbud experience I have had . Their overall shape and rubber ear-fin accessories keep these earbuds in the ear consistently and comfortably . Sound and mic quality are both excellent . After about 3 months of normal use , however , the right earbud crapped out on me - went silent . Not an unusual experience for me - fortunately , this was within the 1-year warranty , and JLab promptly replaced mine with a new pair . These represent probably the best value in earbuds I have seen .#### #### ####[([32, 33], [28], 'POS'), ([32, 33], [36], 'POS'), ([30], [36], 'POS'), ([30], [89], 'POS')]

I priced this product at several large brick and mortar stores prior to purchase . All were sold out . I have previously owned many , many MP3 players including Apple , Sony and Samsung . I was looking for a simple , very small , lightweight , large capacity , durable MP3 player with great battery life and a color screen with a customizable user interface . I postponed my purchase for weeks until I found this unit on Amazon . This product met every single requirement . I clip this to the front of my shirt and plug in the premium quality ear buds included with the unit and forget that it 's there . It is so lightweight and full featured that you are only wasting time looking for anything better . The Sandisk website offers updates to the firmware inside and gives you more features and current software at no additional charge after purchase . The Sandisk brand , most notably found in many high end devices are known for their quality memory storage and was the final step in my decision to purchase . Do n't waste your time looking for anything comparable in this price margin , just buy it .

Works great , used it to move the computer speakers next to the bed for better TV sound . The cord is of good thickness and not cheap and thin as other wires tend to be . The 3.5mm plugs fit well and tight on both ends and we receive no static or other noises through the speakers due to this extension cord. < br />< br /> If you are looking for a basic extension wire and not looking to pay half an arm and leg , then this Monoprice 25 ft stereo cord would be what you are looking for . I would easily recommended this product to any of our friends or family. < br />< br /> We were not paid nor discounted in any way , shape or form for giving our honest opinion here of this product as a review to assist others . We believe , as a family , it is important to give an honest and accurate review to assist others so they can make good purchasing decisions that can benefit them and their family . And not be lead to cheap , unwanted purchases that are scripted by advertisers to buy their products . We are a family that believes in a minimalist lifestyle while trying to be green as much as possible in all departments of our life .

This product fits the DC plugs that come on many portable solar panel systems and seems like an easy solution to combining panels in parallel .

bought model &# 34 ; g300 &# 34 ; off another site ( They are all likely the same internals ) . Picture seems clear . You have to power it with USB . Two Problems : The video stutters for one frame randomly ( every 5 min on avg by my guess ) . Its not actually a stutter but more like every pixel moves up one pixel for one frame then back down . Maybe the average gamer wouldnt even notice it but its annoying . The other thing is the audio seems to cut out very briefly a fraction of a second . Thats more noticeable but more rare .

I ordered this speaker and received it within about 4 days . It came with the box , instructions and a charging cord . I received this speaker for reviewing purposes . This speaker is very sleek , I like the design and the buttons on top are flush with the rest of the speaker so nothing sticks out , there is a button and plug in back where you power on and charge the speaker . Once you power on the speaker a voice tells you it 's ready for a connection , the speaker also tells you when it 's connected with a device and also when it needs to be charged . Although this is a nice feature I do not like that you ca n't adjust the volume of the voice that speaks to you , I would like there to be an option to change it incase I want to use it in a place that is quieter . Other than that I the speaker is loud and music with more bass sounds great also . We used this in our workout class and it worked very well everyone could hear the music great when with the instructor speaking loudly .

Quality construction with one minor flaw . This plate uses screw terminals for the Cat 5 cable . Even though screw terminals do work it put unnecessary stress on the tiny wires .

I purchased my pair for around $ 55 postage paid and am largely basing my review on that fact . Had I paid the list price ($ 179 ) I would not have the same high opinion . For very inexpensive speakers you 're going to be hard pressed to find better in the under $ 100 category . With a sub these will do pretty well as mains in a small to mid sized space . Even without a sub the bass is surprisingly present for speakers this small . As surrounds these are even better and again , at the sale price , a pretty strong value . My main beef is with the cheap / chintzy black fake-wood veneer cabinets - they look and feel like cheap junk . Guaranteed that they wo n't hold up to much abuse or handling . But then , most folks will probably hang these on a wall ... Still ... Point remains , they look and feel like a 50-75 dollar pair of speakers , albeit one that sounds pretty good . In closing I 'd like to add that while these are worthwhile budget speakers they are not anything like the speakers carrying the JBL name from the 90s on back . Not even close .#### #### ####[([82], [116], 'POS')]
These get the job done . I 've had these for months and have yet to figure out a way to make the bendable bit conform to my ears in a comfortable way ( full disclosure that I have very small ears ) . These WILL get tangled faster and in more complicated ways than any other headphones you 've ever owned , no matter how carefully you store them away . I 've noticed in the past few weeks that the audio is starting to get a bit wonky ( sometimes only one ear has sound , etc. ) . Bottom line : I 'm lazy / cheap enough to keep using these for now , but I certainly would n't order them again .#### #### ####[([23, 24], [40], 'NEG'), ([23, 24], [89], 'NEG'), ([82], [40], 'NEG'), ([82], [89], 'NEG')]
Rugged and durable . I 'm no audiophile , I just like to listen to music once in awhile . Every single aux cable I have ever had before this is done for . Life in a vehicle is not kind to wires . Constant pulling,tugging , being stepped on , tangled in the console or glove box ... and so on. < br /> I have not had it long enough to know how it will hold up , but so far its the best I have had . It really does resist tangles . I 've kept it in my backpack , pulled it out without a problem and plugged my phone into my head unit .

I purchased ( 4 ) of these during a sale ( less than $ 29 a piece ) - ( 2 ) for each of my daughters . I could not be happier with the sound or with the design - these are remarkable ! Although they are not quite 3.5 &# 34 ; around , they sound good - not tinny at all . Also , they do n't distort at higher volumes . They can also be easily daisy chained together for more sound . I especially like the way the audio cable is part of the unit and stores cleanly on the back of the unit when not in use - a really thoughtful design. < br />< br /> We have synced these with several laptops and audio units and have not had any connection issues yet - their Bluetooth appears to be very stable ( unlike a set of headphones I have made by a different manufacturer ) . I did see that they advertise these as as being appropriate to clip on to clothing . In my opinion , they are a little too bulky and weighty for that but for in room use , they cannot be beat !< br />< br /> As we have not run the batteries out , I cannot speak for the 5 hour battery life . I can say , however , that they will play for 2.5 hours without any issues .#### #### ####[([35], [89], 'POS'), ([39], [89], 'POS'), ([93, 94], [148], 'POS'), ([143], [89], 'POS'), ([143], [148], 'POS')]

There are some pros and cons . First positive :< br />- The design is beautiful , I liked the sound knob and the clock screen. < br />- It has FM radio with good tuning . It integrates many things together. < br />- Sound quality is good and it is really loud. < br />- Speaker phone is convenient and performs well. < br />< br /> The negative :< br />- The sound is loud but not very rich and high quality . I compared it with a sound bar without sub-woofer of the same price , the sound bar had only 5 watts output power while this iHome is 16 watts . The sound bar was much better and it only lacks the radio comparing to this product that I could use my cell phone to send the radio on it , and the size was fit to my desk so I chose the sound bar. < br />- The screen has only two brightness levels , dim and bright . Both of them was interacting my sleep and I had to put something in front of the screen to prevent the light. < br />- The usb charging power is a little low . When I use my cell phone with wifi and bluetooth being on it takes very long to charge it. < br />- It does not have a remote .

Overall the speaker looks and feels solidly built , but it fails at its most important function . The sound from the speaker randomly gets choppy and cuts out .

Just does n't work unless your within a few miles of the broadcast station .

I love this little blue tooth speaker ! I take this with me on all my outdoor Idaho excursions , and it is a tough little bugger . It has been rained on , dropped , beaten down by the sun , sat near a campfire , got paint and other assorted liquids on it , and it kept me company through all of it . Did I mention the battery lasts forever ? This speaker is pretty loud and will belt out tunes for close to 40 hours on a full charge . While it is not as versatile as other units ( connecting to it ) , the NFC and Bluetooth work flawlessly . It does come with a two-sided audio jack , but I have n't needed to use it thus far . The only cons that I can think of , is that the bass is lacking and it says &# 34 ; Low battery &# 34 ; when the juice gets low . It is like two + hours after it starts saying low battery , that it actually dies . It also lacks the deep thump of bass on some songs , but it is unnoticeable on most songs . All in all , I put this thing through its paces and it performed beautifully . I Highly recommend this speaker !< br />< br /> Full Disclosure : I was given this speaker for my fair and unbiased review .#### #### ####[([112], [114], 'POS'), ([148], [150], 'POS'), ([193], [114], 'POS'), ([193], [188], 'POS'), ([110], [114], 'POS')]

[[ VIDEOID : f61afe09501d39bb8824f7f7b4fad170 ]] Works perfectly for a pair of speakers that only use 4 Pole jacks - and there is a disappointing paucity of 4 Pole AUX extensions beyond the typical 6 feet here on Amazon ... fortunately , I had already bought a cable before from KabelDirekt , so I am extremely pleased they were also one of the few to offer 4 Pole in varying sizes. < br />< br /> Good connector quality , slim , flexible , making it easy to snake , tuck , and hide .

The HDMI input on my 8 year old Sony Bravia TV does n't transmit the sound from any HDMI device I own ( DVD player , Playstation , or Chromecast , etc ) . I got this specifically for getting Google Chromecast sound into my home theater receiver , as the Chromecast has no analog output . If you use this for a Chromecast , Amazon TV Firestick , Roku stick , etc . you plug the device directly into the HDMI input of the Tendak , and use a standard HDMI cable between the output of the Tendak and the HDMI input of the TV for video pass through . The unit came with a small 5V power supply ( not shown in product images ) . The video quality appears to be unaffected by the unit . Seems to work well on the RCA outputs , but I have n't tried the TOSLINK output . Sound quality does n't seem to be fantastic , but that might just be the fault of my Chromecast . I have n't experimented with any other devices I own , as I can plug them straight into my receiver directly .

( This is an edit of the 32GB model . 32Gb is rated as being able to hold about 7000 music tracks , 40 hours of video or 40,000 pictures . Apps also consume data storage , as does the operating system of the phone itself which is a fractious amalgamation of Samsung 's Touchwiz and Google 's Android ) . Samsung has come a long way from yesteryears , when its phones were unappealing plastic bricks . Its efforts to create more premium looking devices is evident in this latest Note . The Note 5 is the slimmest and most attractive yet of the line , with a glass back , powerful camera and a redesigned stylus . Packing a 16 megapixel camera which is capable of live YouTube streaming , new users will be impressed by its social media credentials . The front facing camera is a selfie-lover 's dream , having attained 5 megapixels ; a notable increase from the prior model 's 3.9 megapixels . By far my favorite new feature is the ability to jot notes on the phone screen while it remains turned off . And proximity charging is a cool , if not head-turning feature . The speaker is now at the bottom of the phone , correcting last year 's monumental mistake that found the Note 4 's speaker on its back , muffling output . The Note 5 maintains the respectable 2,560 x1,440-pixel resolution of last year . It ships with Android 5.1 Lollipop - a nod and salute to Google 's juvenile notion of naming an operating system after teeth-corroding appetizers - and will be eligible for an upgrade when Android 6.0 Marshmallow makes its debut . Samsung 's Touchwiz mercifully has a very light footprint here . But Samsung eliminated some of the Note 's most distinguishing features . These features were so key that I am returning this latest iteration , and renewing my relationship with my trusty old Note 4 . One reason why I originally embraced the Note line was because of its large battery . I am a road warrior , and I needed an Amazonian who could match me step for step . The Note line was renowned for their battery capacity which were increased with each new release . Even in the electronic world , or perhaps particularly in the electronic world , size does matter . This time , not only has Samsung reduced the battery capacity , it has also towed Apple 's line , and sealed the battery in the phone , such that it cannot be removed . No more swapping out batteries when I am travelling , or when it weakens from multiple charging cycles . The older Notes also came with an IR blaster , necessary for using the phone as a remote controller . All of my appliances can be turned on with my Note 4 . Useful for when the remote control decides to play hide and seek , usually at the most inopportune times . The IR blaster has been eliminated in the Note 5 . Gone also is the expandable slot . Users must now think carefully about how much media they plan on handling with the phone before purchasing because storage can no longer be increased . Going from 32GB to 64GB will cost the average consumer about $ 100 more . And all this for a narrower , slimmer profile and a glass back that may not survive Galileo 's gravity test . In a nutshell : The Note 5 is an unworthy successor to last year 's Note 4 , and represents a step in the wrong direction . I will hold out for 2016 which will surely bring us the Note 6 , if not one Donald Trump for President . Eliminating choices for consumers and issuing a positive press release was ever an audacious move . The stylus is now the only real difference between the iPhone Plus and the Note . It will forever remain a head-scratcher to find companies attempting to eliminate competition by aping the products that they are competing with . Rather than distinguishing their products even more .#### #### ####[([348], [347], 'NEU'), ([348], [411], 'NEU'), ([413, 414], [411], 'NEU'), ([512, 513], [516], 'NEU'), ([578], [411], 'NEU'), ([578], [577], 'NEU'), ([581, 582], [516], 'NEU')]
I love singing in the shower ! I cut loose since no one is around or within earshot to hear my tone deaf voice . This little waterproof speaker by Photive Rain is great . Love to listen to all of my jams . The reason why I knocked off two stars is due to the on / off button . Regardless of how low the volume is set , when you turn this little thing on or off , a loud , and I mean LOUD beep goes off . Not cool when you take really late night or very early morning showers . Other than the loud off and on sound , this speaker works wonderfully and one charge lasts for at least a weeks worth of showers !#### #### ####[([28], [33], 'NEU'), ([28], [117], 'NEU')]
The bass is way too boosted in these . Being a sennheiser product I expected a nice even equalizer between bass and treble .

Not a bad product , but for the price , I was expecting slightly better . For me , the biggest thing is that the highs sound VERY tinny , at least to my ears . If it was n't for that they would honestly be very good earbuds . The tinniness is almost unbearable at times though , and gives me a headache on some songs ( listening to Wham !' s Last Christmas puts me in tears ).< br />< br /> That being said , they 're very durable earbuds . Feeling them , you can tell they 're high quality . The earbuds themselves are solid , and the cord is very lightweight . The asymmetrical design took awhile to get used to , but I 'm really liking it now . I found these while looking at a list of durable earbuds , and I 've gotta say , so far they 've lived up to that standard . If only I were n't considering buying a new pair anyways because of this god awful tinniness .#### #### ####[([8], [102], 'NEU'), ([8], [132], 'NEU'), ([25], [54], 'NEU'), ([25], [28], 'NEU'), ([51], [54], 'NEU'), ([51], [179], 'NEU'), ([51], [28], 'NEU'), ([51], [116], 'NEU'), ([103], [102], 'NEU'), ([103], [132], 'NEU'), ([106], [109], 'NEU')]
I just realized I have had this receiver for over a 2 years and it still works like brand new . I paired this up with my cerwin vega and it sounds amazing . These amplify and create bass . It provide a very rich clear sound . I seen there are multiple negative reviews and I am assuming the receiver must be paired with very cheap speakers or not hooked up correctly . We use this as are main source when were listening to music or having parties . I get compliments all the time and this Pyle was really cheap compared to the other receivers I looked at . There is a little hum however I ca n't ever hear it once the music is up and rocking . That is the only negative I can really find for this receiver .

These ear pads are slightly different than the factory originals , particularly with respect to the interior diameter , which is very slightly larger than the original ones . At first I thought the differences would be noticeable , but I replaced only the left ear pad and after several weeks of use I 'd have to say that any differences have been insignificant . Given that these replacements cost much less than the official ones and seem to perform just as well , I 'd have to say I am pleased . The one factor I cannot yet evaluate is how long they will last compared to the originals , although there does not seem to be any reason to expect a difference in durability .

I 've lived in the same house for 13 years and have had a problem with TV reception ever since I cut the cord about 10 years ago . I 've tried 5 different HD antennas and 4 different amplifiers with each one getting a few channels but none of them getting all the available channels . I had about given up when I came across this antenna and for $ 30 I figured it was worth a shot. < br />< br /> It went together easily and installation in the attic was hot but straight forward . I pointed it at the local mountain with all the antennas on top of it and bam , it was all good . There is still 1 local channel I do n't get but this antenna is by far the best one I 've tried so far and I do n't really care much about that one channel . I read about all the problems people have had with the rotor but personally , I do n't plan on messing with the rotor at all . It works so well as it is that I just hooked the antenna up directly to my media center without using the power box that came with it. < br />< br /> I am SO GLAD to finally be able to record the shows I want to watch completely free of charge . A $ 30 antenna and a $ 35 DVR and I am all set . Now if I can just find a program that does a decent job of removing the commercials , I 'll be a VERY happy man .#### #### ####[([134], [139], 'POS'), ([17], [139], 'POS'), ([17], [14], 'POS'), ([17], [163], 'POS')]
I do n't know how I survived long flights until now , but now that I experienced this pair , there 's no going back ! ! Noise canceling part is about as close to miracle as any technology gets , but the best part about these ear buds , to me personally , is the absolutely amazing design of the ear buds themselves . They are so soft , comfortable and fit PERFECTLY in my ears that I can sleep with them on without ever feeling awkwardness of other in-ear headphones .

Very disappointed with this product . I have purchased two of them because they are compact and sound GREAT when they work . Both have failed prematurely and with little use . Both failed in the same manner . First there was distortion using Bluetooth and then I resorted to using the aux jack in the rear . Then one day you turn it on and there is major sound distortion at any volume level . I have tried charging and discharging the battery and anything else I could think of . I tried comnecting to it with multiple different devices via blue tooth and multiple different cords that were known good . The distortion was not caused by blowing the speakers either . Over time it seems as if the internal amp has a failure . Neither unit was even used near the water or a damp environment . It was used outside while working on small projects . The battery life was great and I talked many of my friends and family into purchasing the same unit ( now with regret ) . You will love it and then hate it . It 's not even worth sending it back the second time because I will just be let down again . It has me so frustrated that this is the first product review I have ever bothered to write .#### #### ####[([52, 53], [135], 'NEG'), ([121], [1], 'NEG'), ([121], [70], 'NEG'), ([131, 132], [135], 'NEG'), ([161, 162], [164], 'NEG')]

I purchased and LG Smart 3D TV and it came with one of this same magic remote . It might be magic but very irritating -- it works like a pointer , or a mouse pointer . You have to wiggle the remote all the time to get the scroll / mouse arrow -- that is , you have to point it at the screen and wiggle , wiggle , wiggle to get the arrow to appear and then you point the remote around and the arrow moves with your movement , then when over your target you press the center wheel down , it acts as a scrolling wheel as well as a command button , just like on a mouse wheel . But , if you stop to read something on the screen , like an instruction or a discription of the program you want to choose the command arrow disappears and you are back to wiggle , wiggle , wiggle to get it back and then try to get back on to your target . If you hit the button wheel , under certain situations and the arrow pops up it may activate the nearest target whether that is what you are after or not . I hate the damned thing , and wish I could get it back to the conventional point and shot remote . I know this is supposed to be designed to use like a mouse but it is slow in responding when you want it and it goes off in just a couple of seconds so if you are not constantly in motion you have to keep waking it up and this gets tedious when you are trying to navigate something like Amazon Video or Netflix . Had I know this was part of the TV I purchased I would not have bought the TV , It is in a spare room so I do n't use it as much as my other Smart TV with the conventional remote , and love it , great 3D . Do n't know what I will do if the built in connection in the other smart TV for the magic remote ever fails ? This typs of remote does not use the external dongal , as it is connect wireless to the TV . I would only buy this remote as a back up just in case the one I have gets broken by accidently bouncing off the wall .

Great adapter from a known tech seller StatTech . Perfectly covets your laptops HDMI output to a TV with VGA and audio inputs . I bought this from other online retailer for about the same price . ( NOTE : if you want audio with your VGA output you have to use a 3.5mm male to 3.5 male audio cable to connect from the adapter to the TV / audio receiver ) Users for this adapter : Connect your newer ultrabook / laptop HDMI output to an older TV with VGA and Audio Inputs Connect your HDMI output to a newer HDTV that has no more HDMI inputs available Connect your DVD player to a monitor with no HDMI inputs ( Note : you probably wo n't get audio on the monitor because it wo n't have speakers ) Connect your XBOX to an old tv or monitor Extract an audio signal from your HDMI output to send audio signal to stereo or receiver Convert HDMI output to VGA than use a VGA to DVI or RCA or SVideo adapter to connect all sorts of components . I have used many StatTech components over the years and think they are well made and inexpensive . Great alternative to $ 50 in store brands .

After plenty of research I decided to go with this set-up . I mated these speakers with the Marantz NR1402 receiver and let me tell you , for only 50W a channel these speakers sound amazing . Movies & music are way more enjoyable now . The only bad thing I can say is I hope you have plenty of room ! The bookshelf speakers are quite large as well as the center channel BUT ... the quality sound from all the speakers makes up for it . The only thing I wish I would have done is waited a lil longer and got the Tower speakers instead but that will be my next upgrade so I can have 7.1 ! They are truly awesome , do n't hesitate , just BUY THEM ! You wo n't be disappointed , I know I 'm not .#### #### ####[([33], [35], 'POS')]
Ordered this Bose System in May. It is now almost September and it stopped working . I had an earlier version of this system and it was much better .

Because we live in a valley in the woods , and a good distance from the TV towers we ’ve tried for years to get consistent reception for our TV ’s . Summer is the worst time of the year because of the leaves on the trees . I ’ve tried at least 4 different antenna ’s some with amplifiers , some worked better than others , but none worked all the time . Today I put up the Marathon CA-2600 all my TV ’s have great unbroken reception . One of the TV ’s goes through a 2 way and a 3 way splitter and it still works . Yes you can spend less money on others , good luck , I purchased this one because of the reviews and knowing I could send it back if I did n’t like it .#### #### ####[([26], [25], 'POS')]

Wanted to use them as an interim solution but not impressed. < br />< br /> The mids seems to be veiled and bass a little too heavy ( and not clear ).< br />< br /> Even given the price .

Big sound from a small puck ! This thing is awesome . I 've been watching one for 16usd and when this one showed up as 15 I put in my cart but once it became 12 dollars I bought it immediately and now I 've been playing with it for 3 days or so and it 's been holding charge playing music in the shower .

Also I dropped it trying to stick it to my forehead so it fell from 6 ' at least. < br />*** UPDATE ***< br /> After I bought 2more I can say that you are unable to connect more than one to audio source for stereo sound .

Let 's you get into the music , very involving . Great detail and soundstage . Headphone stage is excellent . Phono stage excellent , as well . Very good number of inputs . The Wolfson DAC is easily as good as the ESS Sabre DAC in my Peachtree Audio Decco65 . I really appreciate the loudness button , which raises bass by just the right amount , without causing bloated bass . Makes music through my speakers more involving than through the &# 34 ; Direct &# 34 ; button . However , &# 34 ; Direct &# 34 ; makes music sound more transparent and is great for headphone listening . The system remote is a little sparse ; there are some functions on the amp , such as the aforementioned loudness and direct buttons , that are missing on the remote . The speaker binding posts only accept bananas and bare wire . Overall , the compromises are well chosen . This amp makes me forget my Decco65 , which cost around $ 1,000 when new .

So ..... where to start with these . I 've always been a fan of Polk speakers . First fell in love with their sound about 20 years ago when I purchased my first pair ( I think the RT900s ) when I was 14 . Never really bothered with GOOD PC speakers because most of the time I had a good home theater or nice Bluetooth speaker setup in kitchen / bedroom . Lately though I 've spent more time listening to music on my PC so I thought I 'd finally make the jump . My trusty 16 dollar logitech speakers while for the price worked great , were in need of a decent upgrade . After much online research I settled on these speakers because I 've always loved the brand and they came highly praised by a few good online review sites. < br />< br /> Taking notes from other reviews I made sure to place these on a sturdy surface , away from the wall , so the bass response would be accurate , and I also played them for a while to properly break them in. < br />< br /> I deducted a star from them because while they sound suburb ( a touch bass heavy , but the highs are super crisp ) they have a few little flaws . One being how they timeout . Now on PC you want to hook them up via USB so that they take advantage of their own built in DAC . While they are hooked up this way if you are n't using them they timeout after 20mins , so if you then go to play music or other sounds , it takes a few seconds to kick back on . Pretty annoying if you 're wanting to control the sound right away and you ca n't . Also when they are hooked up via usb you want to have your pc sound levels left at 100 percent , and then use the speakers to adjust the volume. < br />< br /> Really though this is the only flaw for me , they sound great , look beautiful , and can easily fill my computer area , and living room / kitchen with clear wonderful sounds . In fact they sound so crisp and clear , I now have to go through and upgrade my mp3 collection and instead use FLAC . FLAC files sound amazing compared to mp3s . I do n't think i would have been happy at their full $ 400 retail price , but at around $ 280 I feel as if they are worth it . Just be prepared to re-rip your CD collection into FLAC or something with better compression than mp3 ( or whatever itunes uses )< br />< br /> Also streaming Pandora via bluetooth on my cellphone sounds and works great as well .#### #### ####[([175], [178], 'POS'), ([175], [220], 'POS'), ([175], [65], 'POS'), ([175], [413], 'POS'), ([175], [462], 'POS'), ([175], [487], 'POS'), ([217], [220], 'POS'), ([217], [487], 'POS'), ([66, 67], [178], 'POS'), ([66, 67], [65], 'POS'), ([66, 67], [413], 'POS'), ([66, 67], [462], 'POS'), ([106], [108], 'POS'), ([106], [487], 'POS'), ([174, 175], [178], 'POS'), ([174, 175], [65], 'POS'), ([174, 175], [413], 'POS'), ([174, 175], [487], 'POS')]

I bought 4 of these to replace my old LG headset when I learned that the newer ones were n't as good as my original one for listening to audiobooks . I tried another brand headset , but it had some strange controls that I could n't get used to ( especially a single button and switch for controlling phone and music ) . So I tried these because they had two sets of controls that I was used to , and they looked like fun , I bought 4 different color combinations. < br />< br /> First thing to know -- I do n't buy these to listen to music . I use them for phone calls and to listen to audio books . So I have no idea about sound quality . I do like that these work well and pair easily to my iPhone . Sound quality for this and for phone calls seems to be just fine. < br /> The minuses -- when the battery charge starts going down , things fail quickly . It wo n't pair easily and the microphone seems to go out during phone calls . So I always have two of these headsets available . As soon as the charge indicator for the headset on my iPhone goes down a level , I put this one back on charge and start using the second one . When it goes down , I switch them out again . Listening to audiobooks , the headset seems to give me about 8-12 hours listening time before I do this , and this works great . I have a Command hook on my nightstand where I hang the headsets while charging , so keeping two there is easy. < br /> The only time one has failed though is with the on / off switch . I guess I 'm a bit rough on them since I never remember whether on is forward or back and I do n't bother looking to see the words on the switch . So I wrecked one so the switch no longer worked . That 's not totally their fault though . I wanted a lower cost headset so I do n't expect high end quality .

I love my llil Bose speaker . Using it as I type . It sounds awesome and it holds a charge . I bought a Jabra wireless speaker that lasted for about a month and that sound sucked . The sound is great , Bose of course . The price is great . I think this is going to be my &# 34 ; go to &# 34 ; present this holiday season . Looks just like the picture and is super easy to operate .#### #### ####[([40], [42], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [1], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [82], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [51], 'POS'), ([49], [82], 'POS'), ([84], [82], 'POS')]

Caution ! I first ordered a single pak version of this light and it works great . So after ordering the double pak i realized this order operates differently than the first .

8 / 29 / 15 - I have had the unit for a few weeks . I currently use it for a sound system in my garage . I watch movie and sports in it . I watched a movie on Direct Tv with HD and fiber optic sound . It sounded pretty good . Was n't as loud as I would of liked . On the other hand , I watched a DVD from RedBox and it was plenty loud . So I blame the low sound on Direct . I have had a small problem with the system going into a mute randomly . I contact Sony if this becomes a common problem . If I do n't have an update then this system has worked great and is a great buy .#### #### ####[([23], [53], 'POS'), ([23], [128], 'POS')]
I ’m a bit older than Mr. Bolt , so I use headphones mostly for brisk outdoor walking . I ’ve tried a good number of the “ better ” ear buds – Bose , Klipsch , Shure – and I was eager to see how the Gibson Trainer TH100 / 27 compared. < br />< br /> First – the Gibson sound is excellent , certainly a noticeable step up from the ear buds I ’ve used . I ’m very pleased with their clarity , tone and detail. < br />< br /> Once set up , the Bluetooth feature is also wonderful – so nice to avoid tangled cords ( where do those knots come from ?!?!) or cords that sometimes get in your way working out . It ’s got great range too – I turn on my iPad , leave it on a table and listen to music all over the house. < br />< br /> The headphones look great – stylish and subtle . Pairing with a device is fairly straightforward . The controls are understated , though , and I had a bit of a learning curve before I became completely comfortable using them . There ’s an indicated left / right alignment , which you should use to remember control placement . I found I took off the headphones at first to search for controls. < br />< br /> One minor note – there ’s an LED “ nightnav ” blinking light for safety . But I always walk facing traffic and , when used per the manufacturer ’s recommendation , the light shines to your rear . Would have been nice to have the light visible both ways. < br />< br /> There 's also an “ Activating Safe Sound ” mode for safety , which basically turns down the intensity of the music . Frankly , I never use it . The sound difference is noticeable , but I still do n’t trust headphones on the street at any reasonable volume to pick up all ambient noise . Gotta use your eyes and constantly look around !< br />< br /> I ’ve used the headphones for about 4 weeks and they are holding up well to perspiration ( unlike some expensive ear buds I 've purchased ).< br />< br /> I guess my only significant complaint with the Gibson Trainer is the fit . In short , they ’re a bit tight for me . ( I wear a “ large ” cap ) . The plus is that they do stay securely on your head , but the flip side is a loss in comfort . To compound the fit issue , the ear pieces have minimal padding . One other wear issue – the headphones bow out from the head just above the ears , making it hard to keep a baseball cap securely on while active .#### #### ####[([100, 101], [104], 'POS'), ([100, 101], [400], 'POS'), ([135], [134], 'POS'), ([135], [416], 'POS'), ([180], [182], 'POS'), ([180], [400], 'POS'), ([180], [416], 'POS'), ([407], [182], 'POS'), ([407], [400], 'POS'), ([407], [416], 'POS'), ([459, 460], [182], 'POS'), ([459, 460], [400], 'POS'), ([459, 460], [462], 'POS'), ([463], [462], 'POS')]
Pros :< br /> 1 . Strong , clear sound for low-end audio and portable devices . Does a great job at what it was designed to do. < br />< br /> Cons :< br /> 1 . Not a comfortable fit . I have to slant the headband forward / backward to reduce pressure on the ear. < br /> 2 . Not audiophile quality . Obviously you should n't expect audiophile quality from a $ 15 headphone , but if you really want to have fun listening to music , I suggest investing in a good pair like Grado or Sennheiser. < br />< br /> Note : Cutting out the foam inside the cups seemed to help improve the sound a bit . Doing so will also obviously void your warranty , lol .#### #### ####[([9], [6], 'POS'), ([9], [8], 'POS')]

I have had my 590 's for about 2 years . I power them with a lexicon RV 8 ran through a Oppo105 Blu ray player for the benefit of analog to digital HDMI .

The flashlight was pretty bright and the radio stations came in clear right out of the box .

These are EXCELLENT bluetooth headphones . I cannot express enough how much i love these cans . The fit my ears perfectly and sound is great ( IMO ) . I am no expert with anything related to sound , but i do love how everything is clearly expressed in these headphones . No crackling or static sound heard even on full volume . If I were to describe it , i would be able to distinguish every sound i hear with these . One thing that does bother me is that it gets warm in my ears . I am thinking this is because of the closed on-ear design . This feature would turn into a Pro when winter comes . I dont have to buy earmuffs anymore. < br />< br /> I recommended these to my classmates and are willing to buy 2 pairs . thank you August , i hope this little review represents what you guys are trying to give to the customers .#### #### ####[([4], [2], 'POS'), ([23], [25], 'POS'), ([23], [107], 'POS')]
Yes my wife and I love JBL products we have an issue with the silicone ear piece coming off . I have been in contact with JBL but their solution is to send the unit back instread of replacing the ear piece . I purchase the first set of JBLs from a box store ... my wife tried them and we then purchase the next set through Amazon . But we both lost one of the ear pieces . Great sound and great microphone when using the phone , clarity . Highly recommend them . Just use caution with ear pieces because of the softness of the material they grab and come off . They do stay in your ear well .#### #### ####[([14, 15], [17, 18], 'POS'), ([14, 15], [72], 'POS'), ([80], [79], 'POS'), ([83], [82], 'POS')]
I was so happy with this purchase . I never bought speakers before but I bought this based on he price and good reviews . I was a little nervous because it was n't a name , expensive brand but this is just as good ! It lasts on a charge so long , I brought it to Florida and did n't need to charge it once but used it an hour or two each day . The sound is very loud . I took it on a speed boat and everyone could hear it while we were hanging out and swimming near the boat . It 's probably not the loudest on the market but it 's definitely adequate .

Really enjoying these headphones . I like that they cover my whole ear so I do n't get part of an ear squished which eventually hurts . I use them for walking mostly and they stay in place even when I break into dance . My ears do eventually sweat but I 'm a sweat-er anyway so I do n't blame the headphones and when it gets bad , I just drop them around my neck for a few minutes - I can still hear the music while I cry out . I 'm not an audio geek so I do n't know how the sound compares to anything else , but I feel I 'm getting great clarity and hearing sounds in songs that I did n't know were there on the radio . I may be playing my music loud when I walk , but I definitely ca n't hear anything around me so noise canceling seems pretty great . Even in the house , I ca n't hear people calling to me . Overall I 'm very happy with these headphones and may have to get some for my boyfriend since he keeps stealing these !#### #### ####[([118], [1], 'POS'), ([118], [117], 'POS')]
Purchased this speaker to use with my laptop & tablet . The sound quality is clear and it even puts out a little bit of bass .

Beautiful piece of electronic engineer , however , I feel it is too big and the grill is not to be removable by the consumer and the fuse is to be changed by skilled technicians only . It sounds excellent in my music room along with two shelf speakers to complete the set . You can change the frequency from 50 Hz to 200 Hz ( I believe ) and gets into stand by mode shortly after no signal is received anymore , then the led turns red ; turns green immediately after a signal is received .

For purposes of full disclosure please note I received these headphones in exchange for an honest review , and I do mean honest review . As an audio-nut I own lots of headphones including several sets of wired , conventional wireless , and Bluetooth headphones and I ’ll say right up front that I ’m surprised just how much I like these headphones . As a pretty hardcore audio-nut I ’ve been disappointed by every set of Bluetooth headphones up to this point , including some with some pretty good ratings , and as a typical audio-nut I ’m usually skeptical of anything labeled Bose . However , these Bose SoundLink II headphones came as a very pleasant surprise . I spent several hours listening to a mix of music that included vocals , bass leads , intricate guitar , and a new age album that reliably trips up poor speakers and headphones alike – a test that every other Bluetooth headphone in my collection had failed miserably . But let ’s start with the design. < br />< br /> The SoundLink II headphones are conventional looking closed back headphones with all of the controls and a flush fitting microphone for use with a phone on the right side . For those new to headphones , closed headphones provide excellent isolation and privacy at the expense of sound quality . Generally speaking open headphones sound better , but at the cost of you hearing everything around you and everyone in the room hearing very clearly what you are listening to . The Soundlink II also functions as a Bluetooth headset for phone calls , and reports from friends are that the microphone sounds outstanding ( better than any of my Plantronics headsets ) in phone calls , however I did not test the microphone ’s noise cancelling ability . Comfort was quite good even for my large head. < br />< br /> I began my listening test with Diana Krall ’s The Girl In The Other Room and was pleased to note that these Bose headphones captured the sultry smokiness of her vocals perfectly . Next I moved on to Chris Rea ’s Hofner Blue Notes . In this rare jazz album an electric bass takes the role of the lead instrument and is accompanied by beautiful piano and drum work . Frankly I was afraid that the bass might be more than a set of Bluetooth headphones could reproduce cleanly , but I need not have worried because the Bose did a marvelous job of digging deep and reproducing those deep soulful bass riffs for a closed back headphone - when played at reasonable volumes . Crank up the volume too high and the bass starts getting muddy but that ’s understandable . As a reality check I listened to of bass master Marcus Miller ’s Nikki ’s Groove and found the same to be the case , keep the volume reasonable on the bass heavy tunes . At normal safe listening levels they do a credible job for a closed headphone . Finally I spent some quality time with Manheim Steamroller ’s Fresh Aire III . Whether or not this album is your cup of tea its deep powerful bass and airy mids and detailed highs do a great job of tripping up poor speakers . The SoundLink II passed the Fresh Air III test with flying colors. < br />< br /> In conclusion , do n’t expect these ( or any other closed-back headphones ) to compete with top of the line wired open-back headphones , but the SoundLinks are head and shoulders the best ( and most expensive ) Bluetooth headphones that I ’ve listened to and I would n’t hesitate to buy a set if I were in the market .#### #### ####[([282], [284], 'POS'), ([282], [494], 'POS')]

As usual , I 'm happy with this receiver , for now . I do n't like the on-screen menus , however , but I rarely need to use them after the initial setup . The real issue is how long will this last before the HDMI sound starts dropping out . I bought this receiver in June 2015 . I 'll update when & if the HDMI sound starts acting up . I 've owned several Onkyo receivers and everyone of them has died this way ... and Onkyo has terrible customer support . I knew this going in so I can only take responsibility for buying yet another one , but finding receivers that do n't have this problem does n't seem to be so easy . It becomes the devil you know vs. the one you do n't know .... so here I am . :)#### #### ####[([18, 19], [14, 15], 'POS'), ([18, 19], [70, 71], 'POS'), ([18, 19], [91], 'POS')]

Everything I heard about Bose Soundlink Mini Bluetooth is true . How that powerful sound can come out of something this small is beyond my comprehension . Pure magic . Years ago I bought a HDMX Jam , while it is good it ca n't hold a candle to the Bose . I connected it to my tv and what a difference in sound ! Love it .

This speaker is absolutely amazing in itself , but the price makes it an irresistible product . I bought one to have a portable speaker for playing music outside and for our kids to play their bedtime music when traveling . The sound is awesome , it has controls to adjust the volume as needed , and it 's size is decent . The sound can easily be heard from 50 ft away and is far more than we expected for sound quality . We 've actually purchased a couple more since to give as gifts .

UPDATE :< br /> Well , turns out things are working as they should . Back to being a happy camper . Took a couple days to get a replacement unit . Sorry for the scare . Would buy again though as it stands . The business part of the transaction was smooth. < br />< br /> This fixed the issue of my light bar flickering on and off constantly , with the old power supply ; now , fully functional again. < br />< br /> INITIAL REVIEW :< br /> Unit is faulty . My friend is an electrician and here 's his review :< br /> It blew my fuse immediately . I tightened all the connections just to be 100 % , verified with my DMM and still blowing fuses . The bad news is , the cost of these blown fuses I 'm having to eat . The good news is , blowing fuses is easy to troubleshoot , so there 's no doubt the unit is faulty. < br />< br /> I believe in 2nd chances , so 2 stars for now . I have a replacement coming . Hopefully this was a fluke , but either way I 'll update the review after it arrives .#### #### ####[([64, 65], [161], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [66], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [133], 'POS'), ([75, 76], [161], 'POS'), ([134], [133], 'POS')]

I got the 8 bay sunlabz charger with an 8 pack of 2800 mAh sunlabz AA batteries . They came at about half charge or less and charged to full within a few hours , it was rather quick . The LCD screen is easy to read and it is clear what the charge level is of each battery . The batteries were easy to get into the charging slots but they were a little tricky to get back out unless you have long finger nails . My one complaint with this product is that the charger unit and the plug both got pretty warm while in use but it was nothing too bad . The batteries however were a different story , they were so hot that they nearly burned me when I removed them at full charge . I 'm not entirely sure if this is the fault of the charger , the batteries , or using them both together but it was n't confidence inspiring . I wo n't be leaving this unit on while I sleep or when I 'm not home .#### #### ####[([42], [44], 'NEU'), ([100], [126], 'NEU'), ([41, 42], [44], 'NEU'), ([61], [104], 'NEU'), ([61], [63], 'NEU'), ([61], [75], 'NEU'), ([61], [126], 'NEU'), ([116], [63], 'NEU'), ([116], [75], 'NEU'), ([116], [126], 'NEU')]

Jam Wireless Light Show HX-P930 is a nice Bluetooth speaker with mid range sound . It can be set up to speak in English , Spanish , French , Portuguese or Tone ( no language ) . Volume is not great so no window rattling here . It has a light strobe feature that can be adjusted in intensity or simply shut off . This is not a bad speaker and can also be used as a speakerphone .

I was foolishly surprised at the size of this thing . I just assumed that it would be a reasonable size , certainly no bigger than my Teac 501 or Mytek Stereo DSD , both of which also have balanced outputs and also play DSD . I was floored when the box arrived . At 19 &# 34 ; wide and 22 &# 34 ; deep , it wo n't fit on any of my media shelves or equipment racks . Still , had it performed well , I probably would have kept it . I was n't expecting sound on the same level as my Teac or Mytek , but I did think that it should be on a par with my $ 200 ifi-Nano which also plays DSD and is only the size of a pack of cigarettes . Boy was I wrong . Regardless of resolution , the XDA-2 obscures detail rendering music lifeless . Instruments are blurred together , and voices are hard to distinguish . In addition , it certainly does n't meet its SNR specs in either the preamp or head phone amp mode . I could n't believe that I heard noise through my Sennheiser 600s , even at very modest volume levels . That 's a first for me with any DAC I 've tried . Then I cranked up the volume driving my new Parasound A23 amp in balanced mode with quality interconnects and guess what ? More noise . Believe me , when I run the Teac , Mytek , or ifi DACs through the Parasound at full volume there 's total silence . The final clincher was the issue with the Windows 10 driver . My anti-virus software would n't let me download it , so I had to disable my virus protection in order to get the driver form Emotiva . This driver would not recognize the XDA-2 on all of my Windows 10 computers , although I was able to find a C Media driver that would . Still , there is a serious issue with either the C Media - or Emotiva-supplied driver in Windows 10 - when the XDA-2 is turned off and on or disconnected while the computer is running , you have to reboot the computer in order to use the XDA-2 at any resolution other that 16-bit 44 or 48k !! ! For me , this is a major inconvenience . After two frustrating days of trying to get the software issue resolved , Ipacked it up and got a return authorization from Amazon . Thank you again Amazon for your amazing customer support .#### #### ####[([20], [19], 'NEG'), ([20], [156], 'NEG'), ([44], [175, 176], 'NEG'), ([44], [279], 'NEG'), ([44], [347], 'NEG'), ([158], [160], 'NEG'), ([158], [279], 'NEG'), ([158], [407], 'NEG'), ([164], [166], 'NEG'), ([164], [166, 167], 'NEG'), ([164], [175, 176], 'NEG'), ([164], [279], 'NEG'), ([164], [347], 'NEG'), ([282, 283], [175, 176], 'NEG'), ([282, 283], [279], 'NEG'), ([282, 283], [347], 'NEG')]

I bought this receiver on a Black Friday sale in 2014 , and am just now installing it . Unfortunately it seems I 'm victim to a very commonly reported problem of the HDMI output failing . The video and audio go in and out every couple minutes and sometimes just cut off completely . At that point , if I unplug and reconnect the HDMI cable , it starts working again for a short while but then continues to go in and out sporadically .

These were the top rated headphones ( by CR ) with active noise cancelation ( anc ) . Comes with football shaped case , usb cable to charge anc battery , small cloth , airplane jack and cable with mic that allows you to take phone calls , skip forward or backward . Takes 2.5 hrs to fully charge battery per manual . Hps must be folded to fit into case . Angeled plug goes into device and straight end goes into hps otherwise switch wo n't work . Hps seal good and allow you to listen to music over other normal room noises , TV and conversations . Construction seems to be on par with price , mainly plastic .

Update : As kindly suggested by another reviewer I updated the firmware and now the audio books play the chapters in order . I 'm afraid to try the locking function using the fast backward key in case I go backwards by mistake . I bought this to replace an older model that died , and let 's just say it 's not an upgrade . First of all there is no power / lock button on top any more , so I keep mistakenly skipping audiobook tracks . But the biggest problem is that this model does n't sort audiobooks by name . I 'm using it exactly like my old Clip Zip , but now the audiobook playlist is n't in order on this model . It might start with track 1 , then go to track 8 , 5 , 12 , whatever . This is extremely annoying because by the time I realize this has happened I 've heard a spoiler . Other than that , I do like the less-slippery feel , and the sound seems to be better . But nothing compensates for having to scroll for every track .

Nice enhancement to the S6 Active . The case is made out of a rubbery plastic and tightly fits the unit . It adds a small bevel to the front so one can lay down the device face down without scratching the face . It aids in gripping the phone .

The price for these is appealing compared to what others with same amount of ports seem to be going for however the plastic is really cheap. < br />< br /> To start off with i bought 2 of these units and 1 of them right off the bat was n't working properly the entire right row of outlets was completely nonfunctional. < br />< br /> The plastic on these things are cheap a simply drop by accident on my part on a rug caused a chip . After reviewing some forums and reviews on this product it seems that failure in some rows seems to happen more often than not and once one starts in a row the rest will follow said pattern. < br />< br /> The connections in my opinion would be more ideal if they were facing up because the way these outlets are facing they seem to get in the way of other connectors depending on the thickness of them so if i have to use multiple i have to skip one outlet to leave enough space for connections to hook up properly . Doing this at this point renders some of the 8 ports useless because of the other cords space. < br />< br /> If the outlets were facing the other way the phones chargers and other cables would face to the sides of this unit not causing it to block the neighboring ports . It seems they spaced out the ports with an intent to accomadate other connections however the outlets should be facing up and sideways for this to be effective. < br />< br /> I like the one that i actually got working but i would n't advise getting one of these if you actually want to use all 8 outlets instead get one that has the '' faces '' facing up not sideways like these because connections do get in the way of nearby ports .#### #### ####[([58], [73], 'NEU'), ([22], [73], 'NEU'), ([22], [202], 'NEU')]

The Pocke Talker has been a God-send for Doctor visits , watching television and assisting with phone calls ( she puts the speaker on and sets phone head aside ) . I highly recommend the Pocke Talker to anyone struggling to hear ! I personally think the Pocke Talker has been more helpful than her $ 4,000.00 hearing aides !! ! Perfect for anyone who cannot afford hearing aides ! Great Product !#### #### ####[([15], [74], 'POS'), ([15], [120], 'POS')]

Quality of these headphones are decent enough for everyday use . They deliver a clear sound , nothing spectacular .

First , let me start off with my equipment . i have Polk RTI A7s and CSI A6 and PSW111 sub ( and 2x RTI A3 's on the way ) . The sound is fantastic ; could not be happier with the performance . Been listening to radio and watching TV with it so far . Yesterday , my Blu Ray player arrived and we scheduled our first &# 34 ; Movie Night &# 34 ; as a family . Unfortunately , the screen and sound cut out / went black and the screen read &# 34 ; not supported &# 34 ; or &# 34 ; HDMI1 not found &# 34 ; . It then corrected itself until it happened a couple more times . I tried a different HDMI cable , same issue occurred . Tried a different HDMI input and had same issue . I then connected it to the HDMI input that my cable TV was connected to and everything worked fine ; no issues . I then connected my cable box to the BD input and then HDMI3 input and experienced the same black screen issue on both of those . So i 've confirmed there is an issue with at least 2 of the HDMI inputs on this unit . As of this writing , i am awaiting a replacement device . I will post an update upon receiving the replacement unit . UPDATE 9 / 3 / 15 : While awaiting my RMA , which i received within 2 days , i read some reviews about performing a firmware update . I updated my firmware from 1.4 to 1.5 . Since performing the update ( which took ~ 30 minutes to complete via USB ) , the issue has not resurfaced . I am cautiously optimistic . Increasing this review to 3 stars and will update again in a few more days after i have some time to perform additional testing ... UPDATE 9 / 5 / 2015 : Could not make it through the first night of testing , post-firmware update . Watching Optimum worked fine . No video cutting out issue . Had the neighbors' kids over to watch a movie . Nothing i did would get a picture from the DVD player . Ran a firmware update on that as well , no dice . Bypassed the receiver and went straight to the projector - worked fine ( without sound , of course ) . Connected the same DVD player to 2 other TVs - no problem . At this point , i 've lost all patience with this device . lowering to 1 star - when it works , it sounds fantastic . Shame it doesnt work properly . i originally asked for a replacement , but now i will simply return this device and look for a different brand . UPDATE 9 / 9 / 2015 : Picked up a different receiver ( Pioneer Elite VSX90 ) this weekend . Everything works great , no issues . I will say - the Yamaha sounded better IMO , though i havent pushed the Pioneer yet . Happy with my new purchase .#### #### ####[([132], [407], 'NEG'), ([132], [505], 'NEG')]

Without a doubt , this is the best &# 34 ; smart charger &# 34 ; I 've ever used . The automatic detection of common cell types on a slot-by slot basis , a quick test to determine the needed charge , then meaningful info of current voltage , charge rate , and time on-charge for each slot independently plus a bar-graph indicating the charge level makes this charger a pleasure to use . The unit appears to be well constructed while longevity has yet to be proven -- I 've had the unit a week so far . Charging lithium LiFePO4 cells takes an extra &# 34 ; button push &# 34 ; but such cells may not be found in many household . I have not used the 12 VDC input option as yet but feel that is a nice feature for mobile users . I highly recommend this product and for the price consider it a very good deal .#### #### ####[([12], [161], 'POS'), ([48], [7], 'POS'), ([48], [161], 'POS'), ([50, 51], [142], 'POS')]
Im giving this an early review before fully testing it . I have used it in one flight and seems to do the job . I did not time it but Im not sure it can last 27 minute flight time with a H3-3D and GoPro connected to it . If I can add to this review , I will and I wo n't hold things back . What I have noticed that it fits snug within the drone and sometimes I feel it fits better then the original battery . It does work on the Phantom 2 . I have bought other batteries from other sellers and have only gotten about 30 flights out of them and now the cause the Phanton 2 to land at a fast pace. < br /> As far as the shipping went , great . Arrived within 3 days as they said it would. < br /> Update ........< br /> I have an update on my purchase of the battery . I have flown with it twice and I 'm a little concerned about the performance of it . They claim or say you can get about 27 minutes of flight time out of it but that 's not true in my case . First flight lasted 15 minutes then by the third flight 10 minutes . 10 minutes with a gopro 3 + on it and the gopro was fully charged. < br /> To be fair , I have not contacted the seller yet because I just got back from flying the DJI Phantom 2 . Could be a bad battery or something but I have n't had a chance to speak to them. < br /> If my flights continue or get worse then I would say the batteries are not worth buying . More testing will happen soon . I will add more comments for updates. < br />< br /> Oct 1 , 2015 I 'm writing a follow up and changed my review from a 2 to a 4 star . I was a little disappointed with the battery at first because of how short the flights were . After contacting them , they sent out a new one at no charge . I have never had a company respond in such a professional way and to try to solve this issue the best they could . Awesome !! ! I would buy again with full confidence and will buy more from them . They stand by their products .#### #### ####[([137], [140], 'POS'), ([137], [269], 'POS'), ([137], [349], 'POS'), ([183], [140], 'POS'), ([183], [269], 'POS'), ([183], [349], 'POS'), ([236], [140], 'POS'), ([270], [269], 'POS'), ([270], [349], 'POS')]

Construction seemed OK . Controls and connections worked as advertised . It was larger than I expected even though I had checked measurements .

I would not have paid the original price for these ( about $ 200 ) because they are basically plastic and a little bit flimsy .

I bought Tx-200 together with AKG K375BLK High-Performance In-Ear headphones and I must say they are the best . These eartips block noise so well I can barely hear the guy sitting next to me at work even with the music off . They are comfortable and soft and the small tips suit me very well. < br />< br /> The only downside is they are not as durable as I thought they are , so I 'm disappointed and this is the same reason why I gave this product 3 stars instead of 5 . Two weeks in and the tips have already split and now I have to replace them . I use my earphones on my commute to and from work , which takes 15 minutes , and also during work and sometimes at home . I think it is the method of compressing them before plugging them into my ears that shortened its lifespan .

I took time out of my daily life to write thsi review to tell you not to buy this speaker. < br /> The speaker is okay , it has good sound quality AT LOW VOLUMES , but the up shot of it is , it is way WAY too basey , I read reviews that said it would NOT shake or reverberate when played , it does , at full volume even just watching a cooking show , it jumps and knocks nearby cups , and edges its way off the coffee table . My cat is frightened of it , that 's how much it moves. < br /> So you 're forced to listen to stuff at lower , more hard to hear volumes ... exactly what I did n't want. < br /> Also , it is big , and heavy . You might as well sacrifice the smallest amount of sound quality and volume , and get something you can take places with you . It might as well not be blue tooth , because the battery life is about 2 hours , and , partly I am to blame here , but the only thing that would easily sync to the bluetooth was my phone , no , ONE of my phones , the other was too hard , and I could n't figure out how to bluetooth to my lap top and so have to sit with it plugged in via an AV cord. < br /> I 'll admit to being half the problem on that one. < br /> Also , I do n't like the buttons that are n't actually buttons because you ca n't feel them , you have to sit up and look at them , which is hard in the dark when you 're watching netflix . Why not just have buttons ? There are two buttons , and the rest or touch pads . It just seems dumb. < br /> I absolutely regret buying this speaker and wish I 'd bought one two or three sizes down , saved myself a few hundred bucks , had something I could crank , and take anywhere with me . I still would have bought SONY and do rate their quality , juts not this item. < br /> This speaker is like that incredibly large monster truck type car that you see guys driving and just think : what an idiot , bet that thing just eats money , and we all think you 're a twat .#### #### ####[([24], [50], 'NEG'), ([31, 32], [30], 'NEG'), ([155, 156], [30], 'NEG')]

Very isolating , great quality , do n't bust as easily as others ( not even at all most of the time ) , and a great gift for anybody ! I have already bought 4 pairs ( 3 silver and 1 black ) and I plan on buying more if I need to . I will most likely buy more pairs this coming Christmas since I tend to sometimes be accident prone .

Very pleased with Boombox . excellent sound quality . I like the fact that you can adjust the bass and treble . The remote is very easy to use . My son was on leave from the military and he saw and heard the boombox , he stated he was going to buy one for his personal use . I would highly recommend this product .#### #### ####[([23], [26], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [5], 'POS'), ([20], [26], 'POS'), ([20], [10], 'POS'), ([18], [10], 'POS')]
I received these as a free review sample . I 'll get to the point : sound quality for music is lacking . However , if you are a casual listener and are into jogging , strenuous activities and wet environments these may be perfect. < br />< br /> Basically these phones have a distinct bias towards the higher frequencies , with a crossover to bass in my right ear and flat mid range response . In other words , if you are a critical listener you may want to consider other phones on the market . I was able to get decent bass response in my right ear using my phone 's EQ app , but could not get any decent mid range . The net result is music sounds one dimensional ( even with the bass response in one ear . ) I am guessing that the crossover threshold is such that you get high frequencies in one ear and low in the other , with the mid somehow cut out or deemphasized . For folks who listen to audio books and inspirational or educational material this will not be an issue . I will say that even with the volume cranked the high end did not break up or become tinny. < br />< br /> Despite the sound , I cannot find fault in the construction or ability to withstand harsh environments . From a comfort perspective I had no problem wearing these for three hours with the medium buds that ship with it along with small and large ones . And I love the way they were securely held in place with the ear hooks . Another feature that I like is the cable is flat and tangle-free . Of course , the nicest feature is they are , indeed , waterproof .#### #### ####[([16, 17], [21], 'POS'), ([16, 17], [103], 'POS')]

I received this as a free review sample nine months ago and have been using it ever since . I am not going to claim this is the greatest speaker on the market , but will say that it 's on my short list of favorites . In fact , while technology has continued to improve in the nine months since receiving this , it is still a contender. < br />< br /> Here is that I especially like : first the sound quality is nicely balanced among the high , mid and low frequency bands . At maximum volume the highs remain clear and full without breaking up of sounding tinny . The mids are truly rich , and the lows , while not booming bass , are also full. < br />< br /> Sound projection is slightly better than many speakers this size . Most will work within two meters on a desk or night stand , whereas this one can be clearly heard across a room about five meters away . I appreciate that because I can leave this setting on my media shelf , playing , while I prepare a meal across the room in my kitchen. < br />< br /> There are a few things that I find personally irritating . At the top of the list is the Poweradd NFC logo that lights up and blinks all the time . The controls behind it light up too , but go dark if not touched for a few seconds . I wish the logo would do the same because to me it 's distracting . The other is the sensitivity of the controls . When they go dark you can re-illuminate them by swiping your finger across the top . That is a wonderful feature , but sometimes when you swipe your finger you also activate one of the buttons . That ' feature ' irritates me . But I can live with those issues. < br />< br /> I do like the NFC ( near field communication ) feature where all you have to do is set an NFC-enabled phone or tablet on the logo and it will automatically initiate a pairing and connecting process . Most modern phones and tablets are now NFC-enabled , so even if you are a technophobe you will love that feature . My Note 3 in a heavy leather case had no problems with pairing via NFC. < br />< br /> At about a third of the volume level I was able to get the total twelve hours of play time from this speaker . At max volume about half that . It does take about twelve hours to charge one of these from total rundown to full using a 1 Amp wall charger. < br />< br /> Overall , I obviously love this speaker because I donate most of my review samples and kept this one . This one has respectable sound and sound quality , and is easy to use . If you are looking for a first bluetooth speaker bookmark this one as you compare because it truly is reliable and solid.d of the volume level I was able to get the total twelve hours of play time from this speaker .

Got it as a gift for a relative along with Grado SR80e and a Schiit Modi DAC . Simply put , the synergy is incredible . The extra warmth of the tube amp balances the slightly aggressive Grado sound signature ... a little sweet to Grado 's spicy. < br />< br /> You can swap tubes , as well as opamps , to fine tune the sound but I was very impressed with just the stock hardware . The SR80e / I + combo was particularly suited to rock and jazz records . The fuzziness of an electric guitar , the sweetness of a trumpet , this amp gives character and depth to every instrument. < br />< br /> Just be sure to match your components well when you purchase an amp . This amp , with its swappable tubes and opamps , can pair with just about any brand of headphone . But moving up the Grado scale with my Grado RS1e , which are 3x the cost of the Little Dot , the amp was clearly out of its depth . My Elekit TU8200 is better suited for the high end headphone duties . But for a secondary / desk system or a mid-fi headphone rig , I have not heard a better amp than the I + , especially given my preference for Grados . The next step up would be something like the Millet MiniMax at twice the price . Amazing value !#### #### ####[([32], [140], 'POS'), ([32], [246], 'POS'), ([32], [24], 'POS'), ([32], [72], 'POS'), ([77], [246], 'POS'), ([77], [24], 'POS'), ([77], [72], 'POS'), ([143], [140], 'POS')]

I picked up this speaker from Home Depot when it was on sale . For a relatively small speaker it sure carries quite a nice sound quality and rich bass . 4 buttons on top : Bluetooth pairing button , volume +/- buttons , and a play / pause button which I find to be quite useful . On the back is the AC plug in , a manual on / off button , and an Aux-in plug for 3.5mm audio cable. < br />< br /> The whole front of the speaker is mesh covered and is very aesthetically pleasing . This speaker does NOT have a built-in battery so it is less portable than some smaller speakers out there , but more than makes up for it by providing a large robust sound performance . Pairing is easy , though with any / all bluetooth devices , especially some slightly older ones , reception can be interfered by objects / walls in between the devices' line of sight , so keep that in mind .#### #### ####[([25, 26], [139], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [24], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [100], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [133], 'POS'), ([29], [139], 'POS'), ([29], [28], 'POS'), ([29], [100], 'POS'), ([36, 37], [56], 'POS'), ([40, 41], [56], 'POS'), ([63, 64], [56], 'POS'), ([89], [139], 'POS'), ([89], [100], 'POS'), ([46], [56], 'POS'), ([89, 90], [139], 'POS'), ([89, 90], [100], 'POS')]
Did n't expect much but needed a few cheap pairs to have on standby in case my son 's earbuds broke. < br /> We bought 2 pairs and he really likes the sound with these .

Everything seemed fairly straight forward in setup .

Does the job and for a good enough price . My only grip , and the reason I gave it four stars , is that the output to the monitors come out of either side instead of the back .

I have used several of these mini speakers. < br />< br /> This one sounded the same as much more expensive versions. < br />< br /> The one issue was the button cover was on the wrong side , it was easy enough to switch , but the buttons are on one side only so not sure how that was missed. < br />< br /> It does not come with instructions , and the buttons only show one function , such as there is no + or - for volume . but if you hold a button down it adjust the volume .#### #### ####[([33, 34], [30], 'NEU'), ([33, 34], [38], 'NEU'), ([77], [30], 'NEU')]

The Sentey ® Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8 was just delivered 30 minutes ago . I popped it out of the box , plugged it into the USB wall receptacle , synced my IPhone , and got my socks blown off ! It usually takes me a week to post a review not with Sentey ® Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8 , I knew I had to do it right away . I was expecting the tinny , no base , inadequate volume that plagues most Bluetooth speakers . Not with the Sentey ® Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8 my kitchen filled with rich quality sound to the point I actually had to turn it down . There 's plenty of reviews on here that explain size , function , buttons , charging , etc they are all great but you have to hear this thing to believe it . It 's going on my Christmas gift list and I had been looking for a quality to put in every room and I think I found it and at a fantastic price . The Sentey ® Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8 is awesome in every way ! I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review#### #### ####[([3, 4], [138], 'POS'), ([79], [78], 'POS'), ([82], [78], 'POS'), ([82], [81], 'POS')]

Advantages : Very good product worked as advertised . Other products that do the same thing cost a lot more . Disadvantages : Very tedious to program , Product should have a button to program instead . Also theres no way to mount this device so its just laying behind my Dash . All that being said the price is still a huge factor as to why it gets 5 stars and obviously it works so i would recommend it . Fyi i used this to Delay my clarion eq from shutting off too soon ( which was causing a feedback noise )#### #### ####[([26], [24], 'POS'), ([42], [39], 'POS'), ([88, 89], [24], 'POS'), ([88, 89], [39], 'POS')]

Very bad quality#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'NEG')]
Nice outfit , exactly as described . However , 4 stars vs. 5 because : 1 ) the receivers are a bit large to add to things like phones and checkbooks . 2 ) The sound from the receivers is not consistent between receivers ( some loud , some not so loud ) , and if they 're in another room , you really have to listen for them ( this was during testing .

Purchased these for my SUV in hopes for a better quality product considering they are priced higher than any other portable DVD players out there . Install was easy . The idea of touch screen sounded nice for navigation by kids . Instructions for operation were minimal . Two weeks after installing one DVD player would not turn on and the other would not read the DVD in the player giving the message &# 34 ; No disc. &# 34 ; Pay attention to warranty / shipping and return policy . I had to pay another 32.17 to ship them back and seller would not pay for return even though they were clearly faulty . Minimal time period to return for full refund . Horrible customer service on the product .#### #### ####[([10], [28], 'NEG')]
Very happy with this power inverter ! I was thinking of purchasing the larger 800 watt version ( which of course would be less restrictive in terms of what I can plug in while sacrificing the convenience of portability ) , and am glad I did not. < br /> This little thing is able to handle charging two laptops as well as a tablet ( using the USB ).< br /> While the charge received is n't the fastest , it does get the job done in a reliable manner. < br />( Second time I 've purchased this model !

I really like this speaker I use it all the time the battery life is quite impressive it goes all day 8 hours plus at close to full volume !

IT REALLY SOUNDS GREAT ... It 's only negative side is that it does not get super loud , , , , do n't get me wrong it 's pretty loud ( for it 's size other companies make louder units but also triple the price $$).... louder then you and a bunch a buddies drink'n beer can talk over at a pick nick bench ! !

Great cable , no complaints so far . Charges our ipod and both iphone 6 we have with no problems . The cable does n't feel cheap and may be a little more robust than OEM .

I do n't know if it is the product because , I could never get it to work with Win 8.1 . It just hangs up after registration . I read all the reviews and most agreed that it would work with 8.1 . Do n't believe it . I changed . net 1.1 as instructed it still did not function . PrintMaster gave me a phone number , if I wish to upgrade . All I got was a robo voice telling me to select 1 or 2 . Hung up after several tries . I have used previous PrintMaster software and it worked just great for me . Never had any problems .

This speaker surprised me !

When I first received my Komando , my first impression was it appears to be a quality made product but the suction cup has a crease in it from manufacturing , as a result I was unable to use it . I contacted the vendor and a few days later I received a new suction cup . The unit works great . At first , I was disappointed because it uses a proprietary program to view the video but it does allows you to export portions or all of the video in . avi format . All around for the price , it 's a great 2 channel dash cam and I would buy it again . Also , I purchased this for myself and a G1W for my wife . I connect her G1W via a USB to my computer and I can access her SD card while it is in her G1W . My Komando does n't work that way and I must remove the SD card from my unit and plug it directly into my pc to access the videos because it is not a USB for access but for Power / DC IN .#### #### ####[([21, 22], [25], 'POS'), ([21, 22], [36], 'POS'), ([21, 22], [165], 'POS')]

I have purchased a version of Norton every year for over 16 years for its virus scanning capabilities . Norton 360 was a piece of junk , but still provided virus protection in spite of being an absolute CPU hog . I 've been using Norton Internet Security the past few years in spite of it not giving me as much control as I 'd like . But none of them were as bad as this version of Norton Security . It nagged me EVERY DAY because I chose not to install its toolbar in Chrome - in spite of checking the option ( every day !) to never remind me again . I finally gave in and installed it . Then I promptly disabled it because I just do n't like 3rd party toolbars in my browsers . Guess what ? Now the stupid software is nagging me again because the toolbar is disabled ! Argggggghhhhhhh !! ! Enough already ! Norton Security has become the MALWARE that it 's supposed to protect me against !< br />< br /> Unless this major bug gets fixed soon , I will NOT be purchasing another Norton product . There are many other virus protection programs out there ( including free ones ) that will protect me without the constant nag screens . Norton has lost its focus on this product and forgets what its software is supposed to do . It 's time to leave it behind .#### #### ####[([152], [154], 'NEG'), ([234], [144], 'NEG')]

This absolutely SUCKS . It 's a complete waste of money . The program is constantly crashing and SO INCREDIBLY slow ! You hit the button to begin your voice over and you have to sit on the edge of your seat because you just do n't know when it 'll start recording , it usually records after a period of 7 to 28 seconds . Also with voice overs you have to record for an extra few seconds because Movavi is SO KIND as to CUT THE END OF YOUR VOICE OVER OFF ! And forget actually adding music , because when you do Movavi starts playing the music WHERE YOU DIDN'T EVEN PUT IT ! But do n't worry , if you only play that clip individually there is no unnecessary music . And unless you LOVE shutting down your computer because it freezes your screen and you ca n't close out so you have to restart EVERYTHING then you wo n't find the software helpful . The program shuts down at LEAST 4 times throughout the period of 1 minute , literally . My experience with this software is terrible so DO NOT BUY IT ! I regret the purchase SO MUCH !

I 've been using Premiere Elements 9 for over 5 years to teach stop motion animation with live capture and onion skinning . I was excited to download Elements 13 on my new Surface Pro and show my grand children how to create their own Lego movies . What a monumental let down to find out that this version dropped all stop motion features . Is the Chroma key the next feature to be dropped ? I hope I 'm in time to stop my district from upgrading since this is one of the 4 multimedia projects in video storytelling . There is no option to contact Adobe for a resolution . I would appreciate a refund please. < br /> If you only need regular video editing this will be great . You wo n't have any features that make you pay more for if you actually want to use them . There is still a bit of effort needed to navigate and learn the software but well worth the effort . YouTube and Adobe TV have tutorials for every step . It really is a decent introductory level video editor with the additional benefit of also having pretty advanced features when you are ready .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [169], 'NEG'), ([67, 68], [59], 'NEG'), ([67, 68], [74], 'NEG'), ([67, 68], [200], 'NEG')]

After reviewing this product for several days and asking a lot of questions , I have found out that it does not write in responsive web design . All the templates are fixed width . You can select one for mobile which will be 640 px . Thus , I guess they are expecting you to use your phone sideways . I think more than half the people on smart phones do not use them sideways . I checked out their gallery of sites , and all had viewport settings that were fixed width of 900 to 1160 pixels . Thus PC monitor size sites , which show the exact same way on mobile devices with the small print that you can barely see . This software is not the right tool for what I need . And too bad , I really like the look and ease of the interface , and it has good capabilities , including manual entry of html when you want to . But responsive is what is happening , and Google just punished a ton of us web site owners who are not responsive .

This is a terrific product . One thing I would mention is that if you 're going to install this on a computer that has a trial version loaded onto it , like most computers have , that you should uninstall the trial version prior to installing this one .

Then you can select an option to enter in the product key . It 's a pretty easy installation from that point , it guides you step by step through there .#### #### ####[([96], [95], 'POS')]

I 'm rating at 5 Stars based on my usage needs . I have been a Quicken Windows customer for years and have never used all the features available . I truly depend on the product to ensure that my accounts are updated , bills paid on time , and data is tracked for tax purposes . No special investments are tracked , no business data , etc ; With that caveat , I had been running Quicken 2014 Professional under VM Parallels on my Mac . It was the slowest , most exasperating experience so I read all the reviews and decided to buy the new 2015 Mac version . The software runs fast and efficiently on the Mac now . Account set up is quick and easy . The downside is I never was able to convert my Quicken Win files . Tried for two days and the converter software just kept stopping with an error . I had done everything Quicken support and community had suggested for converting VM Quicken files ....... totally a waste of time . Overall , if you can live with just exporting all your old data as archive and doing a new Quicken Mac install , AND are a basic user like I am , I think you will be pleased with this version .#### #### ####[([112], [114], 'POS'), ([112], [116], 'POS'), ([140, 141], [177], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [52], 'POS')]

Downloaded this last night due to an issue with Microsoft Streets & Trips ( error 0xc004d301 ) . There were a few people on forums suggesting this is a good replacement . It is not . Running street addresses is difficult and time consuming . If you want to search an intersection and drop a pin it takes quite a bit of effort and time . Additionally , there is no night mode for the map display , only high contrast . If you are used to running Streets & Trips as a search and pin system , this map system is far more complex and proves very frustrating . It has far more capabilities and settings , but is lacking in simplicity . Even when configured it does not allow for simple search and go settings . One thing I absolutely loved about it was the ability to use the GPS location to automatically search for things like gas stations and restaurants ahead of you within a specific degree .#### #### ####[([10], [7], 'NEG'), ([10], [120], 'NEG')]

Long time Quicken user . Because they force you to upgrade to continue to connect to banks for updates , updated to Deluxe 2015 . By far this is the worst Quicken version that I have ever used . Nothing but problems with on-line downloads , hours and hours of research and finally got it working . Today it no longer updates bank accounts and just fails without error codes or messages after you enter the update vault password . Their support chat was a complete joke , scripted responses , did n't read what I posted in my initial issue write up .

I can somewhat understand Intuit 's business model of selling relatively cheap software , and forcing you to upgrade every three years as essentially a way of charging for software maintenance .

Matthew McConaughey is a brilliant actor .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [33], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [33], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [3], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [41], 'POS'), ([38], [41], 'POS')]

Interesting story . Some of interactions between Molly and John are not realistic and frankly boring .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([5], [11, 12], 'POS'), ([5], [15], 'POS')]
The only thing this movie has going for it is the cast . The story never really happened . It just &# 34 ; was &# 34 ; - I was very disappointed , especially in Emma Stone 's character . When I see movies like this , I often wonder about the people who do the editing - are they too involved in the movie to see that it makes no sense after they get through with it ? I was 45 minutes into it before I understood what was going on - I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer , but the people I watched it with were just as clueless as I was .#### #### ####[([11], [32], 'NEG'), ([14], [15], 'NEG'), ([14], [15, 16], 'NEG'), ([14], [32], 'NEG')]

Very good documentary give this more stars than what I was able to put .#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'POS')]
Very good lots of bone-crunching action#### #### ####[([5], [1], 'POS'), ([5], [4], 'POS')]
I was pleasantly surprised how much accompaning footage this documentary had .#### #### ####[([7], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([7], [6], 'POS')]
I would have rather seen a miniseries with much more detail . In other words , I 'm interested - tell me more . Ashton Kutcher did a great job .#### #### ####[([10], [9], 'NEU'), ([10], [28], 'NEU')]
Kind of cheesy . Did n't hold my interest . Love sci fi , fantasy & action but the poor acting and low budget special effects just did n't fit the bill for me .#### #### ####[([20], [19], 'NEG'), ([24, 25], [22], 'NEG'), ([24, 25], [22, 23], 'NEG')]
This is a terrible movie ! The poor actors deserved better ! It does n't make any sense !!! ! Skip it ! A complete waste of time !#### #### ####[([8], [3], 'NEG'), ([8], [13, 14], 'NEG')]

Giovanni Ribisi is excellent you can see his wheels spinning with every lie he tells . Looking forward to seeing more .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS')]
Story was boring . No plot . No drama . In fact no acting . It 's a waste of time .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'NEG'), ([0], [4], 'NEG'), ([5], [2], 'NEG'), ([5], [4], 'NEG'), ([8], [7], 'NEG'), ([8], [12], 'NEG'), ([13], [12], 'NEG')]

My kids love watching it over and over . Excellent animation quality .#### #### ####[([11], [9], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [9], 'POS')]
I love this show. < br /> The stories are told in the context of psychiatric sessions , and have powerful acting , since there 's so many dramatic monologues and interaction involved . Each patient goes from initial introduction to some sort of resolution of the issues addressed in his / her story , sometimes good and sometimes tragic . It 's possible to learn a lot about psychiatry , and it 's engrossing trying to figure out the reasons for the behaviors brought to treatment. < br /> I 'm also hooked on how the good doctor will ever find happiness , himself . Like some of his patients , I too am in love with him !! !#### #### ####[([21], [20], 'POS')]

I love this flick ! I was very happy to find a dvd copy under $ 50 , and i was very happy with the prompt delivery . However , I was disappointed to see that it 's an obvious bootleg , but I just thought ,&# 34 ; Oh well. . At least I have a copy. &# 34 ; As I watched the dvd , I was further disappointed to find out it is edited for language ... Lame ...#### #### ####[([26], [25], 'NEG'), ([26], [32], 'NEG'), ([26], [70], 'NEG'), ([78], [32], 'NEG'), ([78], [70], 'NEG')]

Far fetched as hell , but a decent show nonetheless#### #### ####[([8], [7], 'POS')]
This is a drama / love story with a charming and heart-warming ending . Family friendly . May or may not be based on a true story ; there are some conflicting reports out there on that fact . However , the movie is well acted and has an A-list cast . Worth watching . The moving is older ( released around 1993 or so ) but does n't &# 34 ; feel &# 34 ; dated when you 're watching it .#### #### ####[([50], [9], 'POS'), ([50], [11], 'POS'), ([50], [49], 'POS'), ([45], [44], 'POS')]
Very funny , great chemistry and refreshing look at how people really behave . I was so disappointed to finish the season so quickly . I hope it returns and I can binge watch again !#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([4], [6], 'POS'), ([4], [17], 'POS')]
I have only watched the first episode so far , but they folks involved in this have done an excellent job of translating the characters to film .#### #### ####[([24], [19], 'POS'), ([22], [19], 'POS')]
