I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality . The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better .

What else do you need to know ? Oatmeal , instant ( make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins ; nuke for 90 seconds ) .

Good oatmeal . I like the apple cinnamon the best . Though I would n't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste .

The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright . Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two , but I probably wo n't get this again .

Pros :< br />+ packaging , shipping , price < br />+ sold about a year before its expiration date ( enough for me to eat / share 9 boxes )< br />+ not too " fresh " like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form . it 's a real mint !< br />< br /> Cons : none !#### #### ####[([41], [33, 34], 'POS'), ([4], [0], 'POS')]

I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much , I had to come write a review .

Okay , I should not eat potato chips , nor should anyone. < br /> But these are so spicy , I would find it hard to eat < br /> very many . That makes them an indulgence that < br /> rescues some people from overindulgence .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [19], 'POS')]
It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me . Wo n't order this brand again . Great chips otherwise .#### #### ####[([26], [25], 'NEG')]

Great price for an excellent chip . At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip .

This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips . Not my taste . Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering . You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before . I 'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips .#### #### ####[([8], [20], 'NEU'), ([21], [20], 'NEU')]

These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code . It was nice to have a larger size bag . Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch !

Great flavor and All Natural !#### #### ####[([1, 2], [7], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [48], 'POS'), ([65], [64], 'POS')]

When originally produced in England these we 're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty . Hard rather than crispy , are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour , a real shame .#### #### ####[([10], [9], 'NEG'), ([10], [39], 'NEG')]

These chips are okay . Personally , I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange .

I purchased these because of the low salt , and they were indeed low in salt . However , many , many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil .

These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it ( especially at the bottom of the bag . Even if they are trans fat free , they need to be a lot less greasy .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEG'), ([8], [19], 'NEG'), ([17], [19], 'NEG')]
DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family 's favorite . Kettle 's are dark / burnt,more broken bits , taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch . Oh well .#### #### ####[([6, 7], [13], 'NEG'), ([6, 7], [1, 2], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], [25], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], [18], 'NEG')]

These chips taste awesome . And unlike most other flavored chips , they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip . Just do n't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption . They 'll totally know it was you .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS')]

Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I 've tried every brand out there . These are by far the best .

I 've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag .

I agree with the company motto " A Natural Obsession " . I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent . The flavor of these is very strong , so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor , like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread .

The consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon , peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor . They cook easily in either the conventional oven , or on the grill when wrapped in foil ! Go ahead , treat yourself !#### #### ####[([8], [0], 'POS'), ([8], [19], 'POS'), ([8], [28], 'POS'), ([7, 8], [0], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [0], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [19], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [28], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [28], 'POS')]

It 's a great product - especially if you like garlic ! No need for " slicing & dicing ! ( Which is a good thing when your right side is " stroke paralized "!)

I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods . It gives everything a bit of sponge ( especially cakes ) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking .

Great product !< br />< br /> The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural. < br />< br /> Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar. < br />< br /> Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [34], 'POS'), ([1], [44], 'POS'), ([59], [34], 'POS'), ([59], [44], 'POS'), ([59], [50], 'POS'), ([59], [57, 58], 'POS'), ([8, 9], [34], 'POS'), ([8, 9], [44], 'POS'), ([58, 59], [50], 'POS')]

I love these chips ... and my husband does too . He wipes them out before I can get to them . The variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like .

Pop Chips are the best chips I 've had in a long time . I 'm a Weight Watcher and to satisfy that salty craving I get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points . And when I buy a case of them they average I think about . 94 . Not bad .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [4], 'POS')]
loved the assortment pack . everyone in family loves them . low fat , lower calorie and all natural , simple snack for kid 's lunch bags .

These are better than any low calorie chips I 've ever had , and I prefer them to normal chips . They are wonderful . Oprah even loves them .

I originally found these at a Target out of my home town . I fell in love with them as part of my Weight Watcher 's plan . They are a good snack alternative when I crave something salty .

These taste wonderful ! Guilt free if you can stop at one bag . Will definitly buy again !#### #### ####[([12], [2], 'POS')]
Love , love , love these crunchy little treats . They remind me of " Munchos " but without the greasy tounge afterwards .

I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine . They a had a $ 5 coupon code so I figured " what the heck !" . WOW -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is AWESOME !

I do n't know why everyone loves these chips . They are healthy but taste disgusting . Only the original flavor tasted good , so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea . I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these .

I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them ? Mainly , fat , fiber , sugars , and then any vitamins ? Thanks so much ! !#### #### ####[([23], [2], 'NEU')]
I shared these with my two older sons , then ordered more . These are great to put in the glove compartment for after work .#### #### ####[([21], [15], 'POS')]
Two words : potato flakes . Not sure what the buzz about these is . Try one bag before you buy a case . Ca n't be returned .#### #### ####[([4], [10], 'NEG')]
in my book . You can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse . Just wish That there were more BBQ and Cheese flavored selections . The Black pepper is the BESTEST yet .#### #### ####[([31], [34], 'POS'), ([30, 31], [34], 'POS')]
I 've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips . I could n't eat them though , they just do n't taste good to me personally .

These popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie , crunchie snack . They are much lower in calories / fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled .

Popchips are phenomenal ! Unfortunately , just not readily available at a retailer near you . Ordering online is the next best , especially with Amazon Prime service !

I 'm really glad Amazon carries these , they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too . We have n't found a flavor we did n't like yet .

Great Chips - No after taste ...< br /> Seem to be much better for me. < br /> Need to buy the big bags now .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS')]
Not anything to rave about . They were okay . I think if I truly had a craving for chips I would just buy and eat " regular " ones . Wo n't buy again .#### #### ####[([19], [8], 'NEU')]
Popchips are good and great for diet snack . But on Amazon the price is nearly double the cost of Costco . An 18 pack is only $ 7.89 at Costco .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'NEU'), ([0], [4], 'NEU'), ([13], [16], 'NEU')]
So for a " healthier " snack it sure is salty . But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories . Each bag is 100 calories with 10 % sodium intake for the day. < br />< br /> The chips are not bad , i just would n't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt .#### #### ####[([6], [10], 'NEU'), ([50], [10], 'NEU')]
The chips are good with fast service but I ordered a case ( 24 ) of Popchips 6-flavor Variety Pack and received 24 bags all Barbecue flavored .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([6], [5], 'POS')]
I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste . It was nothing like what I expected ( granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips ) . I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for .

I bought these chips thinking that they are " all natural " per their description of " No preservatives , no artificial flavors or colors . " When I received them I checked the ingredients , and they contain " yeast extract ," which is synonymous with MSG ( yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid ) . I will never purchase this product again .#### #### ####[([3], [9, 10], 'NEG'), ([55], [52, 53], 'NEG')]
the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor . all the other flavor was just so-so#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'NEG'), ([14], [1], 'NEG'), ([8, 9], [1], 'NEG')]
I 'm not as crazed about these as everyone else , but for a low-calorie snack , they 're fine . They certainly do n't do much to curb the appetite though . I 'm typically just as hungry after finishing as before - not like with Protein Chips ( also available through Amazon ) .#### #### ####[([15], [19], 'NEU'), ([47, 48], [38], 'NEU')]
The texture is like rice crackers , which I personally do n't like . Taste is n't too bad , but every single bags are too salty , even the original flavor . I 'd give four stars if they make low sodium chips . The salt. . is one of your worst enemies . I bet it does more harms to your body than MSG 's .#### #### ####[([23], [26], 'NEU'), ([42], [26], 'NEU'), ([4, 5], [26], 'NEU')]
These chips are too salty !!!< br /> I like the crunch , size of the bags , and variety. < br /> But i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'NEG'), ([11], [9], 'NEG'), ([34], [32], 'NEG')]

Love the chips , nice 100 +/- calorie snack , reminds me of Munchos , but less greasy , flavors are good ( salt & vinegar least favorite ) .

This chips are really good and it 's fun getting the variety pack . Now , are they as good as " regular " chips ?

Love these popchips . They are all great . Do not care for the salt & pepper flavors .

I love Popchips . They may take some time getting used to if you 're used to the oiliness of potato chips , but they 're only 100 calories per bag . Buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag , but you 're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around !#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'POS')]

I found these chips originally at a local market . However , I have been unable to find them since . WHEW ! what a relief when I was able to locate them .

Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors . Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which were n't that great .

We use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say#### #### ####[([4, 5], [17, 18], 'POS')]
Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill . This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food , and no iodide .

I too was a little disappointed with the mix of the Donut Sampler . In my case I had 12 of the 35 were decaf .

This is an excellent product for the non-gluten diet .

The popcorn itself is yummy , just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper . The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped .

I 've always wanted to like coconut water - low in calories , high in minerals - but I 've just never liked the taste much . The pineapple juice in this really makes a difference . It still needs to be well chilled to be good , but it makes a healthy post-workout drink .#### #### ####[([54], [13], 'POS'), ([54], [52], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [52], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [52], 'POS')]

I enjoy them a lot and so does my son . I have to say that this kind is one of my favorites . It is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals .

How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me , is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product ?#### #### ####[([37], [18], 'NEG')]
Excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule . My Fiancee fell in love with my brother in law 's and had to have one !

It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache . This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this . I would have never bought it had I known . It seems like it would taste good otherwise .#### #### ####[([3], [8], 'NEG')]

I brew the 8 oz cups , 10 and 12 makes it too thin . It 's good at that point but adding some creamer , whipped cream , and or cinamin always improves it .#### #### ####[([5], [13], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [33], 'POS'), ([24], [33], 'POS')]
Husband and Grandaughter LOVE this cocoa ... Make it for them all the time as I drink my coffee. .

I have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find Grove Square to be about the best of them all . I usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers , my favorite being the Sugar Free Caramel Macchiato .

Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop . Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension . I guess I can add marshmallows :-)#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'NEU'), ([3], [7], 'NEU')]

I do n't ven know why i ordered these , it was just on a whim . But what a surprise when I brewed myself some hot chocolate . The taste was unbelievable , just like homemade .

I was expecting something more ... considering the Keurig does such a good job with coffee. < br /> But this stuff ?

I received my Keurig as a Christmas present and I am loving cocoa at the end of the work day ... no mixing , no microwave and positively no pot on the stove ... just warm , chocolatey goodness on demand .

We had previously tried another brand of hot coca k-cups . We bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value .

I am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for Keurig . Previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so-so , but this is definitely better .

We have tried many of the different hot cocoa k-cups ... everything always tasted so watered down , even when using the smallest setting on the machine .

I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page does n't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat ( partially hydrogenated oil ) .

Just tried this for the first time today . They are " ok " , but they do have an odd aftertaste . Not sure I 'll be ordering these again .

I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery . My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa .

I did n't expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup , but here 's a tip : put on 8oz setting , then add a 1:1 ratio of heated milk .

I really did n't notice Elmo on the package ? These are for kids more than adults . Nothing wrong with flavor , but priced for kids that scream alot .#### #### ####[([21], [18, 19], 'NEG')]
This was a new food for my dog , and he seems to have adjusted very well to this product . Thank you , and I wish there were more coupons available for this item .#### #### ####[([19], [26], 'POS'), ([4], [16], 'POS')]
These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I did n't realize until I tried one , and ended up with a little bit of a headache , which made me check the ingredient list - it is n't noted on the front of the box . They definitely have an artificial taste , I would not buy them again .#### #### ####[([52], [51], 'NEG')]
Even my kids like this . They are always asking for hot cocoa . Its not too sweet and very chocolaty . It is not super high in sugar or calories so its a great little treat .

Good tasting and the pricing is pretty good . It 's always sold out on Keurig.com , so I come here to make this purchase , I love Dark Chocolate !

This is a wonderful Dark Chocolate flavor . Much deeper flavor than the Milk Chocolate . The Milk Chocolate is good but does not have this deep flavor . Will be buying this again. !! !#### #### ####[([4, 5], [9], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [3], 'POS'), ([13, 14], [20], 'POS'), ([17, 18], [20], 'POS')]
These were a little disappointing . The hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange ... kind of plastic tasting . Have n't been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig#### #### ####[([7, 8], [11], 'NEG'), ([14], [18], 'NEG'), ([14], [22], 'NEG')]
After trying several of these k-cups , we threw the rest of the box away . It only ever created flavorless brown water . We then tried the Grove Square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups , and were much happier .#### #### ####[([29], [38], 'NEG'), ([22], [20], 'NEG')]
This seems to be the best brand that I have tried . Others have been very weak in flavor , but not htis one . I would truly recommend this for Moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow . Grab the marshmellows and enjoy !

Gross ! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes . The flavor is all fake sweetener ( odd since sucralose is the last ingredient ) and no dark chocolate .

Imagine if you made a craisin out of a berry that tasted like a lemon instead of cranberry . These are very tart , which I love . I eat whole lemons so tart is fine by me .

These cookies are delicious . My grandaughter ate a whole package the first time she tried them . She has several food allergies and finding a delicious sweet treat is almost impossible .

Like a lot of gluten free foods there is a tendancy to crumble , but these arrived in very good condition . The vanilla flavoring stands out .

I am addicted to these cookies . They taste much better than the regular ones . The only draw back is , that they should be available in smaller packages - to avoid binge eating .#### #### ####[([29], [28], 'POS'), ([5], [2], 'POS'), ([5], [10], 'POS')]
My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies . The taste is okay . The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved . Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk .

This stuff is good . My mom gave me a bottle to go with some eggrolls and we were hooked upon first dip .

This sauce is good , but for my tastes it is n't hot enough . I have had other brands tht have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered . This sauce seems to ahve one layer .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS')]

I purchased this sauce as it is the exact same sauce used at the hot sauce bar of Tijuana Flats ( http :// www.tijuanaflats.com /) .

Panda licorice is great . It is always received fresh and is much better tasting than the Red Vines or Twizzler brands .

I really like the " crunchy " chocolate chip cookies . . . the soft ones are chemically softened and , I think , gross . These have good flavor and are great for trips ( although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged . . . wait for a rest stop !) and especially for preschooler snacks .#### #### ####[([7, 8], [2], 'POS'), ([7, 8], [24], 'POS'), ([29], [28], 'POS')]

I meant to pick up the normal Chewy Chips Ahoy and was flabbergasted when I returned home to find that they shoved the word " oatmeal " in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same .

I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies . Wrong ! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just do n't work well together .

Skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil . Not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful .#### #### ####[([37], [39], 'NEU')]

I 've eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best . The extra cost of boneless / skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste .

I found out about these from a co-worker . They are delicious , low calorie , and pack some protein . Eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down .

For people watching weight or nutrition,these chips are an excellent substitute for regular chips . They have plenty of protein as well. < br /> Amazon 's price is much cheaper than buying packs at the local grocery store .#### #### ####[([6], [9], 'POS'), ([19], [17], 'POS'), ([27], [30], 'POS')]
These are one of my favorite ways to eat grains Plus they are a good source of protein . 17 chips per serving is just about right .

I 'm a big fan of the carbs , fat and protein balance of these crisps . The salt is n't overpowering and the taste is OK .

These are the most consistent soy crisps I have had . They are light , flavorful , and always fresh - and usually arrive in very good condition ( not crumbs ) .

These soy crisps are very filling and satisfying . If you are looking for something with a great salty crunch , these are for you. < br />< br /> They are high in fiber and protein , and that is great if you are trying to watch your calorie intake. < br />< br /> I think they are great and recommend them highly .#### #### ####[([34], [32], 'POS'), ([34], [62], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [5], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [7], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [62], 'POS'), ([36], [32], 'POS'), ([36], [62], 'POS')]

This mix makes GREAT belgian waffles . We tried biscuits and pancakes and we do far better form scratch with a standard GF flour .

We 've tried Pamela 's ( second best ) , Bob 's Red Mill and King Arthur 's Gluten Free flour mixes .

I use this to quickly make gluten / egg / dairy free pancakes . I use rice milk and EngerG egg replacer to make pancakes .

We use gluten free Bisquick to make coated baked chicken , waffles , pancakes , biscuits , chicken pot pie . There are many recipes available to make quick easy meals . We really like it .

I was really surprised when I tried this product because I found it to be a really light & fluffy batter .

I made cheddar biscuits with this and they came out a little dry the first time , but i adjusted the recipe and they were amazing . I just added a little more milk and another egg .

As tasty as the regular ( gluten ) product . Only drawback is that you do n't get a lot of mix for your money . Half of the box is needed to make their 12 pancake recipe .

Can as be used to make cookies - even egg free !

I wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice .

My personal preference is to stay clear of this . I did not like the smell or taste . I was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time .

A great idea that falls short . Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans .

I love this mix . My favorite of any I 've tried . The only reason I starred it at 3 is because this is not a deal .

We use gluten free bisquick for many different things - biscuits , pancakes , etc . Tastes good & lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [17], 'POS'), ([4], [17], 'POS'), ([12], [17], 'POS'), ([3], [17], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [17], 'POS')]
I just recently bought Gluten Free Bisquick for the first time . It has been wonderful . I have to admit that I am addicted to their pancakes . They are so light and thick and fluffy ( unlike homemade gluten free pancakes ) . They are absolutely delicious !#### #### ####[([42], [48], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [32], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [36], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [48], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [15], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [24], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [34], 'POS'), ([27], [32], 'POS'), ([27], [36], 'POS'), ([27], [48], 'POS'), ([27], [24], 'POS'), ([27], [34], 'POS')]
This product made wonderful pancakes -- I could n't taste the difference between this Gluten-Free version and the original . I tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success . The texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good !#### #### ####[([33], [38], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS')]
This mix made tasty , crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron , but the whole box only made 3.5 waffles . This would be a five star product for me if I could get more than one family meal out of it for the price .#### #### ####[([6], [5], 'POS'), ([6], [3], 'POS')]
This mix makes the most delicious pancakes ! My gluten eating family wanted mine instead of theirs ! I have Also make sausage balls and biscuits for biscuits and gravy with it ! So Good !#### #### ####[([6], [5], 'POS'), ([22, 23], [34], 'POS')]
I have always trusted the Bisquick name , so I decided to buy this product . I was thrilled with the pancakes and muffins I was able to make . The only thing I have a problem with is the size of the box . It 's very small .

Thank goodness Bisquick finally went Gluten - Free ! I have been 3 years diagnosed with Celiac , and besides pillsbury rolls , pancakes have been few and far between as have good biscuits ! We have eaten many pancakes since this product came out . Way to go Betty Crocker !

So far , I 've only had time to make waffles with this new GF Bisquick , but they were delicious .

These sticks definitely do n't look like ones in the picture. < br /> They are much thinner and IMHO not worth the money .

While I think this product is good , I 'm disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from 18.25 oz to 16.25 oz .

This is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake . Each bar is sectioned into six pieces , which helps with portion control -- and makes it perfect for sharing !

As an ex-Brit . steeped ( pun intended !) in strong black tea , I was n't sure about this , but Revolution White Pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious , light yet flavorful .

The main reason I drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening . My caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning ... only one cup .

I had never heard of this coffee before but I got a bag and really liked it . This Melitta Cafe Riviera Sunset Decaf is a very good decaf with a good taste and body .

I thought this would be a great decaf option , but the flavor is a lot milder than expected . I use a bit more than the recommended amount to coax more intense flavor .

I remembered that Melitta was a very fine ground , and thought it would likely go well in my coffee maker. < br />< br /> But after having a bag of whole beans and grinding it myself , the Melitta came up average at best .

I would recommend this as a good basic coffee . It has a satisfying flavor and will make many a good cup of coffee . I prefer drinking my coffee black and I found this to be produce a good cup .

I 'm not sure what all the fuss is about ?? ? I thought it was a good coffee but not better than the store brand I usually buy . .. and beings the store brand is much cheaper ...

This makes a good pot of decaf . Nothing remarkable - we have served this to many guests to no comments . Nobody asked us what it was , but nobody spit it out , either :-) . It is smooth and not too strong , which is our preference .

This coffee has a nice flavor , not too bitter , just a nice round coffee taste . Rich flavor , naturally decaffeinated with water , and it 's kosher . What 's not to love ?#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'POS'), ([5], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([15], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([15], [13, 14], 'POS'), ([15], [29], 'POS')]
I 'm a big coffee drinker , and this Melitta Cafe offering is rich with no bitterness . Sometimes decaf coffee has a funny , oily aftertaste , but this coffee had none of that unpleasantness . Highly recommended .#### #### ####[([10], [13], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [13], 'POS')]
The coffee is good but it is nothing special . Compared to Maxwelhouse decafe this is nearly the same just slightly better . I do n't feel it is worth the extra cash to buy this instead of a cheaper variety available anywhere . I did enjoy the coffee but I probably wo n't buy it again unless it would be deeply discounted .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEU'), ([1], [46], 'NEU'), ([48], [46], 'NEU')]
First of all , when I opened my bag of Melitta decaf , it did n't have that strong , amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has . I brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker , and while it was ok , there was nothing outstanding about the taste . It was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee I normally drink .#### #### ####[([23], [18], 'NEU'), ([23], [20, 21], 'NEU'), ([52], [48, 49], 'NEU'), ([52], [56], 'NEU'), ([52], [58], 'NEU')]
Very smooth and I used my own filters . The smell is so inviting , I used my own measurements because it was not on the package . I used l tblsp . per cup and I worked out fine for me , I like my coffee tasteful .#### #### ####[([7], [1], 'POS'), ([10], [1], 'POS'), ([10], [13], 'POS')]
I do not like decaf coffee . I think it has an aftertaste . But , I thought I would give this a try . It truly surprised me . There is a mellow , full bodied taste with very little aftertaste to be found . I will definitely buy it again to reduce the caffein in our household .#### #### ####[([37], [35], 'POS'), ([37], [33], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [2, 3], 'POS')]
This coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work , yet it goes down smoothly . To my wife and I , that 's a good combination . The fact that it comes already ground does n't do anything to subtract the flavor either .#### #### ####[([1], [5], 'POS')]
What can you say about coffee , either you like it or you do n't . I liked this coffee , although when I choose to review it I did n't notice it was decaf . That aside , it tastes fine ( made in my Keurig ) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one .#### #### ####[([19], [17], 'POS')]
This coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing . My husband drinks a lot more coffee than I do , and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee . We are looking forward to trying Melitta 's other varieties .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([29], [27, 28], 'POS')]
At last - a decaf coffee that does n't taste decaf ! Smooth , rich , flavorful , with no bitter aftertaste . Starbucks worthy ( but to my husband who does n't care for Starbucks , it 's way better ) .

This was the worst tasting tea , actually the worst tasting anything , that I have ever consumed . I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup .

Dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure , which is why I drink it .

The Ener-G English muffins that I received from Amazon were not of the same quality when I buy them directly from the distributor in Seattle .

If you are looking for English muffins - go to the grocery store and buy them . These do not even resemble English muffins and are tasteless .

This food is organic , sure . However , look at the ingredients , top 7 includes chicken meal . Never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product .

Our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby . Unfortunately , two of the four varieties do n't include meat .

I am always on the lookout for healthy but tasty foods that are low in calories .

If you follow the cooking directions , in my opinion , you have wallpaper paste . Cut the cooking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes , and it is much better - a little chewy , but that 's how I like it !

I do n't think it 's EB , I think it 's Amazon . I buy EB from Babies R Us , Target and Whole Foods , and have n't had any problems . It 's only the shipments from Amazon that come moldy .#### #### ####[([38], [43], 'NEG')]
Organic , and loaded with calories , fat and protein , this the ONLY baby food with meat that my picky little one will happily eat .

The free 2 day shipping Rocks !#### #### ####[([65], [62], 'POS'), ([65], [66], 'POS')]
My daughter thinks this tastes nasty , and I agree . She is sensitive to carrot , so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but does n't contain carrot .

I 've read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when I was trying to wash the dish I served it in in was quite oily . Also , it has a bit of a grainy texture and I think my 6 month old son finds the spinach a little difficult to digest .#### #### ####[([8], [34], 'NEU'), ([26], [34], 'NEU'), ([56], [34], 'NEU')]
I purchased this product from B-R-US when it was on sale and my son seems to like it . I was scared of previous post of mold and I ALWAYS double check the food before I stir and serve .

My girls seem to like this food - they 've only ever shown an opposition to green beans . But it is SO messy . It 's apparently tomato-based , and it gets everywhere . Where we usually just wipe their faces gently , you really have to clean them . It simply turns their skin orange . And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily , even after soaking .#### #### ####[([62], [66], 'NEG'), ([6], [4], 'NEG')]
My picky eater LOVES this flavor . Each jar is 110 calories & 5 grams of fat so this momma LOVES this flavor as well . I 'm ordering more because it 's the one flavor ( besides green beans ) that I know my son will eat .#### #### ####[([39], [3], 'POS'), ([39], [20], 'POS'), ([5], [3], 'POS')]

Earth 's Best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods , but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food . Maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff ( it looks gritty ) .

I do n't know how they did it - but this is by far the worst tasting carrot juice I have ever had . I think it has to do with the long shelf life - expires in 2012 , I drank it in 2010 ( well I tried to drink it ) . It was probably bottled in 2007 or something. < br />< br /> YYEECCHH ! !#### #### ####[([18], [15], 'NEG'), ([17, 18], [15], 'NEG')]

I 've been a fan of this stuff for years . Make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top .

It is n't healthy , despite the description above , though I did not buy it for that reason .

Great for a snack ( I eat a 2500 calorie / day diet ).. . I eat this between lunch and work and it hits the spot . An entire bowl is 400 calories .

Great flavor , and texture . It may not be the best jerky out there , but for the price , I could n't find any better . It comes in a few different flavors , so there 's bound to be one you like .

This is for all the beef jerky lovers out there . If you like jerky this is the best tasting stuff that Ive found anywhere . All of the flavors are great .

This beef jerky is extremely salty . I tried the wood smoked flavor , and I figured people were just being a bit picky . However , it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much . The container says 570mg sodium or 24 % of daily value for one serving . I would recommend trying a different product .#### #### ####[([2], [5], 'NEU'), ([1, 2], [5], 'NEU'), ([40], [44, 45], 'NEU')]

I love all different types of beef jerky , but not this one . It has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt .

I love it ! It 's strong enough to start at least 10 gallons of wine , yet light enough to be flexible , very important for pushing the lid down inside for a sanitizing solution .

Our family is a huge fan of IZZE and this was right in line with that . The flavor was not too sweet and refreshing . My favorite way to enjoy this was with some ice and vodka ... obviously that 's only for those of you reading this that are 21 yrs or older !#### #### ####[([18], [24], 'POS'), ([18], [20, 21], 'POS'), ([35], [27], 'POS')]
I also got the Cherry one and this is just as good . It 's a break from soda or water or coffee . I really liked the light refreshing taste and it does n't fill you up like sodas can . It 's very very tasty and it had a very fresh orange taste , not artificial tasting . I really liked it .#### #### ####[([54], [52], 'POS'), ([54], [26], 'POS'), ([54], [62], 'POS')]
We are big Izzie fans , but we were excited to try this sode . We were VERY pleasantly pleased . It is a very orange taste , delicious and it feels good to know there is absolutely NO sugar . So , when our children want a soda we serve this and they are delighted . It 's a win / win !#### #### ####[([13], [18, 19], 'POS'), ([13], [55], 'POS')]
I repeat , carbonated fruit drinks can be too sugary . This drink reminds me of other orange soda brands without the extra sugar that combined with the metallic can always leaves an odd taste in my mouth . Orangina has a bit more flavor , but Switch Tangerine Orange is light and refreshing , .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [9], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [51], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [53], 'POS'), ([47, 48], [51], 'POS'), ([47, 48], [53], 'POS')]
No harsh after taste , no tangible negatives . It just does n't have the " bite " that I crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer . It 's a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz .#### #### ####[([24], [39], 'POS'), ([30], [39], 'POS')]
I think sodas are a big waste of money . That said , I had the opportunity to try this and it is DIVINE !! !#### #### ####[([2], [23], 'POS')]
I thought the drink was delicious , but too sweet . I mixed it half n half with sugar-free ginger ale and loved it , however , I rarely drink sugared drinks . You need to make a sugar-free version .#### #### ####[([3], [5], 'POS'), ([3], [8, 9], 'POS')]
This drink has a wonderful orange citrus flavor . It is robust but not too strong . A great natural alternative to soda . My 13 year old likes it as well .

This small can of juice is tasty ! The carbonation makes this beverage very delightful , and the juice is not too sugary . It is good to see this drink in the market . Although I would have liked a larger size container so I could drink more at a time , The Switch drink is loaded with Tangerine goodness !

Yes , you should order this drink because it does taste great . ( As long as price is no object )< br /> Tastes like orange juice with seltzer water. < br /> But dont feel guilty about drinking it because it is 100 % juice !#### #### ####[([27], [11], 'POS'), ([6], [11], 'POS')]
I usually cringe a little before I do a natural juice / carbonated beverage . There is frequently something of an aftertaste that is unpleasant. < br />< br /> This is refreshing , light , very bubbly and leaves a bright taste after with no cringe effects. < br />< br /> I definitely would buy this drink .#### #### ####[([42], [37], 'POS')]
Who knew juice could be so cool ? It has a very refreshing taste and lightness , just the right amount of sweet ( not too much ) . Switch is an apt name for this beverage .

The can size is like a Redbull drink 's . However , its sugar content is 34 grams . Attached is a photo of the nutrional facts. < br />< br /> In terms of its taste , in my opinion , it 's quite tasty , sweet , a bit tangy and very orangish !#### #### ####[([36], [45], 'POS'), ([36], [47], 'POS'), ([36], [51], 'POS'), ([36], [54], 'POS'), ([13, 14], [47], 'POS'), ([13, 14], [51], 'POS'), ([13, 14], [54], 'POS')]
If you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar , then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda . The flavor is more heavily tangerine ( which only makes sense ) .

If you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product . Tasty and refreshing .

This tastes like carbonated orange juice , very tart . It is very expensive compared to easier-to-find similar beverages . If one had allergies or health issues , it might be worth drinking .#### #### ####[([4], [8], 'NEG'), ([4], [13], 'NEG'), ([3, 4], [8], 'NEG')]
This orange soda is clearly more healthful , and it tastes tangier , although somewhat less sweet , than other orange sodas .

This is a wonderful alternative to soda pop . It 's delicious , refreshing and most of all , natural . I ordered the Tangerine / Orange . I 'm anxious to try the other flavors .

So , I sampled this SWITCH Orange / Tangerine Blend . Low on the Carbonation , high on the Orange taste , and worth every sip in Gold ! Plus , healthy to boot ...

This can of juice was delicious . It reminded me of the Orangina beverage . I did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with " Energy Drinks " like Red Bull since they market it as " All Natural " .

The Switch Orange-Tangerine beverage is a mix of orange and tangerine juices with carbonated water , and , I must say , it tastes AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!! ! It 's similar to soda , but without all the unhealthy artificial ingredients and high-fructose corn syrup . If you find it , buy it !!!!!!!!! !#### #### ####[([39], [37], 'POS'), ([39], [38], 'POS'), ([42, 43], [41], 'POS')]
Very Natural flavor . Not loaded with sugars and other things not good for you . Has a fresh taste of orange / tangerine and the carbonation is great . Great taste . I enjoyed this product and would recommend .#### #### ####[([26], [28], 'POS'), ([36], [1], 'POS'), ([36], [18], 'POS'), ([36], [34], 'POS')]
According to the side of the can , it 's 100 % juice with a balance on the carbonation . It tastes great if not for the chalky aftertaste . The low carbonation made it feel less of a soda and more of a juice . I probably would n't buy it in the store because of the weird taste .#### #### ####[([32], [31], 'NEU'), ([39], [22], 'NEU'), ([59], [58], 'NEU')]
I drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange / tangerine flavored soda , which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100 % juice ! It has 140 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda . I will definitely be purchasing these in the future ! I also tried their Kiwi Strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well .#### #### ####[([44], [43], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [65], 'POS')]
I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this , but it was too sweet even for me . I even tried adding water , but that did n't help . I have n't tried any of the other flavors , so I ca n't comment on the brand in general , but I 'll never try this flavor again .#### #### ####[([27], [17, 18], 'NEG'), ([27], [59, 60], 'NEG'), ([62], [17, 18], 'NEG'), ([62], [59, 60], 'NEG')]
These are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece . If they were at my local grocery , I might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them . I did n't really like the flavor that well , but if you did , they might even worth up to fifty cents per can . Otherwise , pass these up .#### #### ####[([38], [3, 4], 'NEG')]
A good drink , about 3 WW points . I mean it 's about what you 'd expect from an orange soda - expect it 's all natural , so you recognize the things on the ingredient label. < br />< br /> Downside - really a lot of calories for such a small can !#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([20, 21], [53], 'POS'), ([54], [53], 'POS')]
The logo on the can states " 0 % of what you do n't want ..." but that 's not quite true . It 's quite tasty , but loaded with calories. < br />< br /> Next time , they need to leave out the sugar as well. < br />< br /> Also , this drink is n't readily available .#### #### ####[([57], [26], 'NEU'), ([57], [58, 59], 'NEU'), ([4], [26], 'NEU')]
I 've tried other flavors of Switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them . However , this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet . I felt like I was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down .

I am very fond of citrus drinks to begin with , so maybe I am biased. < br />< br /> But what I liked most about this was it was n't too sweet and it is all natural .

I was pleased to discover that Switch Orange Tangerine is actually quite tasty . More please to find out that it contains no sugar , corn syrup or artificial flavors .

Very refreshing ! Ingredients are 3 different fruit juices , sparkling water , and no sugar ! About 150 calories per can , and they 're smaller than regular soda cans .

Expecting something like Fanta or Sunkist I was surprised how smooth and subtle Switch is . Definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor .

I tried the Black Cherry version and liked it but this one is much better . Great orange taste plus the benefit of juice . And no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use . The carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well .#### #### ####[([3, 4], [7], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [16], 'POS')]
The taste says fresh-squeezed quality fruit . The carbonation content is lower than some drinks of this variety . This ratio makes for a heavier juice drink . Though a delicious treat , especially with breakfast on the deck , I prefer to save a few calories ( 140 per can ) and have more carbonation .#### #### ####[([5], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([8, 9], [11], 'POS')]
It 's basically carbonated fruit juice , but it 's heavier on the juice than a similar drink like RW Knudsen 's ( the latter seems to never hit the spot ) . This drink is a great balance of fresh fruit taste , the right amount of bubbles and something like " zing " . Very refreshing and tasty. < br />< br /> Highly Recommended .#### #### ####[([13], [10], 'POS'), ([13], [45], 'POS'), ([34], [37], 'POS'), ([34], [57], 'POS')]
This tangerine soda reminds me a lot of the drink called orangina but with a pronounced tangerine flavor. < br /> It is basically an all natural carbonated juice .

Four people in my family tasted this orange tangerine drink . It tasted good to all four people , and agreement from all four is difficult . It does not taste like a soft drink , but much better .

8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what I 'd say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me . I 'm not a sugar lover . All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus .#### #### ####[([16], [20], 'NEG'), ([35], [20], 'NEG')]
I tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled OJ but fizzier .

I really enjoyed this drink . The tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty . This drink is 100 % natural and has no sugar added .

Pop the can and get sensory caress from the orange scent. < br /> The taste is pure citrus bliss . Great flavor .

This product is tasty -- it 's carbonated juice ( a blend of several juices , mostly apple , grape , tangerine ) . But the 8.3 ounces costs $ 1 and contains 140 calories . This is a little rich for me , both economically and calorically . I would recommend this for someone who does n't mind spending their money and calories on juice .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEU'), ([8], [3], 'NEU'), ([8], [40], 'NEU')]
The carbonation in this drink was way too much . So much in fact , that it over powered the flavor . ( Orange-tangerine is usually very good together ) . I expect this from a soda , but not a " healthy " drink . Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink . Until then , I 'll pass .#### #### ####[([1], [7, 8], 'NEG'), ([1], [11], 'NEG'), ([23], [27], 'NEG'), ([58], [57], 'NEG')]
I highly recommend Switch if you are looking for a soda that does n't have refined sugar and is loaded with flavor .

We really have to limit additives and sugar for our son with Autism . Switch Orange Tangerine really fills the bill .

This is a nice , refreshing carbonated drink . It has no added sugar , as advertised . But its name is a bit misleading . The " Orange Tangerine " also has some apple and grape juice added .

I have the regular my K cup accessory that comes with the Keurig , but you have to insert the special holder and fill the filter each time , then wash them both out . I like these because they are disposable . And I can fill several at one time and have them ready in the refrigerator when I want them . Very convenient .#### #### ####[([21], [36], 'POS'), ([25], [36], 'POS'), ([25], [41], 'POS'), ([25], [64], 'POS'), ([57], [36], 'POS'), ([57], [64], 'POS')]
What a pleasure it is to be able to use my own coffee , even make cups up to take to work with me ! These are easy , mess free alternatives to the apparatus I bought to use with my machine , there are no coffee grounds in my sink now !#### #### ####[([12], [2], 'POS'), ([30], [27], 'POS')]
I received and have been using my DisposaKups for several days . I highly recomend this product . I fill up a dozen or so at a time and just pop them into the Coffee maker when I want a fresh cup of coffee . The coffee comes out fresh and with no coffee grounds in the cup .

They are just the right size , the filter works fine and so does the lid. < br /> They 're easy to fill and store for future use. < br /> Since its " all-in-one " and disposable like the pre-filled Keurig cups , its a good way to enjoy my favorite brand of coffee .#### #### ####[([8], [10], 'POS'), ([53, 54], [9, 10], 'POS'), ([53, 54], [10], 'POS'), ([53, 54], [50], 'POS'), ([53, 54], [52], 'POS')]

The seller was prompt to ship , I receive the disposable K-cup in two days . When I receive them , I try one of the disposable K-cup on Keig , the ease of use and the quality of the cup it made and the saving from pre-fill K-cup coffee brands is worth the price .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS')]
I love these disposable K-Cups as I prefer to use my own brand ( s ) . These accomplish the job perfectly and so easy to use . Thankyou for this product . Seller was prompt in shipping .

I ordered the DisposaKups because I have several coffees in bags that I had left over and wanted to use . The cups work great . I quickly figured out that the filter must be pushed down in order for the lid to fit . Easy to load and easy to dispose .#### #### ####[([41], [49], 'POS'), ([41], [24], 'POS')]
These cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap . All seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10-15 % overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee .#### #### ####[([1], [2], 'NEU')]
Caused my cuisinart k-cup brewer to leak every time I used it . Great idea , just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it .#### #### ####[([23, 24], [26], 'NEG')]
I have tried another brand of one cup coffee making . These made the job easy and no mess . The other method had a plastic holder and lid and a paper basket . You disposed of the inserted paper basket only . The plastic would be very warm to the touch at the very least . Then you had to rinse the plastic holder and top for any grinds that might have escaped .#### #### ####[([8], [15], 'POS'), ([44], [48], 'POS')]
This product saves me money since I can use a regular brand that i like in these kcups and I can still have the kcup convenience of making one drink at a time without using nasty instant coffee . Great product !#### #### ####[([11], [39], 'POS'), ([37], [35], 'POS'), ([40], [39], 'POS')]
I really enjoy this disposable . The only thing that would make it better would be for the cups and lids to be made out of a more eco friendly material . Coffee tastes great .#### #### ####[([30], [28, 29], 'POS'), ([4], [2], 'POS'), ([32], [34], 'POS')]
I love these DisposaKups . They allow me to use some of my favorite canned or fresh bean coffee in my Keurig coffee maker . There is no mess , easy as using the regular K kups , just throw away when you are done making your coffee . LOVE the convenience . I have just place a 2nd order .#### #### ####[([28], [49], 'POS')]
Great product to tide me over with my supply of Starbucks til they start making k-cups . Easy to assembl and use with my own ground coffee .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS')]

I like the DisposaKups . If I 'm fixing more than one cup , it 's quicker to use the DisposaKups than it is to clean out the refillable holder , which came with my machine .#### #### ####[([29], [16], 'NEU'), ([29], [28], 'NEU')]
I was getting tired from washing out the little refillable baskets to make a second cup . The solutions are to get multiple baskets or the disposable type . The filtering is a little better and the coffee has fewer solids . It is easy to use and does what it says .#### #### ####[([23], [44, 45], 'POS'), ([30], [34], 'POS'), ([30], [44], 'POS')]
Tried the disposable k-cups and they work great , just as good as keurig k-cups . Put my own mid grind coffee in cups and they worked without problems . They could n't be any easier to use . Will continue to use them .#### #### ####[([3], [7], 'POS')]
Product is , as advertised , a good way to utilize your own coffee blends . It is easy to fill and prepare for use , however , it sometime leaks at the end of the brewing process .#### #### ####[([14], [18], 'NEU'), ([14], [30], 'NEU'), ([0], [7], 'NEU')]

I have lots of ground coffee and since having my Keurig have not been able to use it . But , with the disposable cups , I can use up all my ground coffee and get the tastes I want .

My wife just loves these cups . First off I have to say they arrived a month earlier than stated . Excellent ! The convenience of being able to use your own coffee and throw away the little cups afterwards is fantastic . No clean-up . Excellent .#### #### ####[([38], [41], 'POS'), ([5], [3], 'POS')]
It is difficult to judge the amount and grind of coffee to put in the K-cups . If it is too fine a grind or is too packed full it only give you a half of a cup .#### #### ####[([10], [2], 'NEU')]
I found these cups to be easy to use , and a lovely way to make pods of your own favorite coffee .#### #### ####[([21], [20], 'POS'), ([3], [6, 7], 'POS'), ([3], [12], 'POS')]
We have the K-cup , however , these disposable K-cups are the best ever .

Product arrived earlier than expected and was just what I expected - an easy and cheap way to make my own Keurig K-cups . Great for company .

DisposaKups - Disposable K-Cups for Keurig Brewers - 50 Cups , Lids , Filters - 100 % Disposable are handy because you buy your own coffee that you like and just fill K-cups and then throw them out . I pre-fill them so all I have to do is put them in the machine .#### #### ####[([3], [17], 'POS'), ([3], [2], 'POS')]
These things work very well . The only trouble I 've had with them is if you leave one in the machine overnight , it sticks and is hard to get out . Otherwise , a great product !! !#### #### ####[([37], [36], 'POS'), ([37], [4], 'POS')]
THE LIDS DO NOT FIT . COFFEE RUNS OUT OF THE POD . A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY . THERE ARE OTHER FILTERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MUCH BETTER .#### #### ####[([1], [15], 'NEG'), ([22], [29], 'NEG')]
FINALLY , a cheaper alternative to buying K-cups , & I can use all of the half-full bags of coffee in my cupboard from my pre-Keurig days ! Works perfectly for both of my Keurig machines !#### #### ####[([7], [3], 'POS')]

These cups were difficult to cap ( putting the lids on securely was a comedy show ) and they created a mess when used in the Keurig ; the water went everywhere .

The units go together easily , but no matter how much or little coffee I put in the filter , it caused overflow . It 's as if the filters are too thick .

The service and delivery from Amazon was great . However , the product itself is not worth buying . No matter what I try , coffee leaks out around the Kcup when brewing .... it makes a mess !

It took a couple of tries to figure out how to snap on the cap and a couple of tries to tell how much coffee to put in it for the strength preferred . After that , it is economical and not much trouble .#### #### ####[([24], [39], 'POS'), ([24], [41, 42], 'POS')]
This is a great idea , but i find that the grounds get into the coffee , and the coffee does n't come out of the maker as nice as the regular kcups . It is messy as it comes out and misses the mug . It still is nice but is not quite as good as the orginal .#### #### ####[([26], [36], 'POS')]

The only difference I can see between using this blend and using brown sugar is that you do n't get the usual " sugar rush " when you eat the result . Cookies and pies made with this Splenda blend - which does contain some sugar - taste the exactly the same as they did before . Great stuff ! And it 's gluten-free too .#### #### ####[([9], [63], 'POS'), ([9], [57], 'POS'), ([58], [63], 'POS'), ([34], [57], 'POS'), ([38, 39], [63], 'POS'), ([38, 39], [2], 'POS')]

These beans are my favorite for making espresso . I get the most amazing crema from them , especially when I grind them frozen and store them in the freezer .

I agree with one of the previous posts - coffee is a matter of personal taste . My wife and I really liked this coffee , it was fresh and flavorful . If you like dark roasts , do n't buy this one , it is definitely not dark . The flavor is very distinct and pleasant , as opposed to some Kuna and Blue Mountain blends we have tried before .#### #### ####[([24], [22], 'POS'), ([24], [28], 'POS'), ([24], [30], 'POS'), ([51], [54], 'POS'), ([51], [56], 'POS')]
The coffee was not stale as some have had , but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this . I believe a better product could be had with the same beans .#### #### ####[([12], [14, 15], 'NEU'), ([18], [3, 4], 'NEU'), ([1], [3, 4], 'NEU')]
We had found some other peaberry coffee previously which had a really interesting , rich flavor to us . For some reason , this brand just tasted flat to us by comparison .

This is a good tea that has a nice flavor . My only complaint is that for a rich tea , you have to use extra tea bags . This is sold in bulk which helps off set the price for using more tea bags .#### #### ####[([19], [8], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([9], [8], 'POS')]

Wow , very weird taste . I typically like all the ingredients , but this mix just tastes wrong . It 's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea , but with a licorice aftertaste .

I 'm new to tofu , newly vegan , and was dismayed at the price of tofu in local health food stores and the scarcity of it in regular grocery stores .

I 've tried it with both my cats , several times . Every time they eat this , and other Whiskas Temptations products , they vomit within minutes. < br /> They LOVE it , they WANT it , it 's CHEAP but it makes them puke , so , I 'd consider this a bad purchase .#### #### ####[([56], [55], 'NEG')]

We purchased an assorted package of K-Cups ( by various makers ) and of all the coffees THIS is my FAVE ! I really ca n't see any reason to ever taste-test another flavor ! It smells delicious and TASTES DELICIOUS too ! !#### #### ####[([16], [20], 'POS'), ([16], [37], 'POS')]
The coffee is good . However , at least half of these have n't been sealed correctly . When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere . Not fun to clean .

Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot . Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself . Anyway I quite enjoy these . I never buy flavored ones so overall I 'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [34], 'NEU')]
Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I did n't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker . Weak coffee , flavor did n't appeal to me either . Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side . Wolfgang 's vienna roast was pleasant though .#### #### ####[([34], [33], 'NEG'), ([59, 60], [62], 'NEG')]
Never got a delivery as fast as we did this time . We were running low on our special coffee . We have sampled many K-cup coffees , some in assorted packs and decided this is the best .

This coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor . I am disappointed though because I looked at the bottom and it says decaf . I dunno bout you but I drink coffee for the caffeine .

Very delicious coffee , thankfully Amazon sells this flavor now . I have been waiting for it since I tasted this last year . I like the fact that you sell it in a 2 Pack rather than a single .#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([35], [25], 'POS')]
Delicious coffee , good medium blend . Its hard to find something that isnt too weak or too bold with K-cups , but this flavor was perfect . Will buy again .#### #### ####[([24], [26], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [3], 'POS')]
Good flavor . Coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering .

While good quality , it was not at all what I expected . It smelled like caramel and vanilla , but it tasted like straight black coffee . I was pretty disappointed .#### #### ####[([26], [31], 'NEG'), ([25], [31], 'NEG'), ([25, 26], [31], 'NEG')]
The coffee is just OK , a little weak . The price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money .#### #### ####[([11], [15], 'NEU'), ([1], [8], 'NEU'), ([1], [4], 'NEU')]
I was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is . It has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak .#### #### ####[([9], [7], 'NEG'), ([9], [25], 'NEG')]
To me , this has a good , balanced flavor . Some flavored K-cups seem too light on hazelnut , or too light on coffee . This one is just right .#### #### ####[([9], [6], 'POS'), ([9], [8], 'POS'), ([13], [16], 'POS'), ([13], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([13], [30], 'POS')]
This k-cup actually smelled up the office . And it tastes as good as it smells . I found it to be very flavorful .#### #### ####[([1], [23], 'POS')]
Light and flavorful definitely describes this K-Cup . I often find it hard to find flavored K-Cups that are n't either 1 ) so strong you lose the flavor or 2 ) so light you 'd be better off drinking water .

Usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out . It was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be .

Wolfgang Puck definitely has the best coffee for the money . I absolutely love the French Vanilla .

Jamaica Me Crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee .

I drink my coffee with a splash of half-and-half . Other hazelnut k-cups are too bland for me . I much prefer Wolfgang Puck 's excellent rich roast with definite -- but not overpowering -- hazelnut flavor .#### #### ####[([11, 12], [15], 'POS'), ([27], [25, 26], 'POS')]
This coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger . We loved it and it has become our favorite . If you want some coffee to " caffeine you up " , this is the one for you ! !

This is very good coffee , but it does n't have as much flavor as the Van Houttes creme caramel . If your looking for something that has a lot of flavor , go with the other . If you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor , this is it .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS')]
By far,this is the best flavored K cup coffee I 've ever had . Good body , not bitter , no flowery aroma ( like with the Green Mountain flavored K cups ) .

This coffee is surprisingly delicious . We never had a problem with the k-cups bursting ; maybe it is a defect on the coffee brewer. . ?

I personally did not care for the coffee , too mild for me and a little " nutty " flavor in it . I will stick with Tully 's Kona and House blends , also Emeril 's Big Easy bold .#### #### ####[([7], [3, 4], 'NEG'), ([7], [9, 10], 'NEG')]

This is my # 1 favorite coffee . Blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect . Thank you !!< br />< br /> Question : why was I charged postage on this brand when I have never paid on any other brand of K-Cups from Amazon#### #### ####[([8, 9], [14], 'POS'), ([6], [5], 'POS')]
If you like your Keurig you need to try this K-cup . Smooth taste with just a slight hint of flavor . Not overwhelming like some brands . My new favorite .#### #### ####[([13], [12], 'POS'), ([13], [30], 'POS'), ([4], [2], 'POS'), ([4], [30], 'POS')]

Wolfgang puck k cups are under the radar - their coffees are smooth and delicious and Jamaica Me Crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market .

I 've always hated the Peete 's or Starbucks burnt-bitter taste . This is a great blend , still strong without the burn roasting. < br />< br /> FYI , low quality beans are burned to hide it 's bad taste .#### #### ####[([16], [15], 'POS'), ([16], [3], 'POS'), ([33], [31, 32], 'POS')]
I like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill . This is every bit as good as Deidrich and Tulley 's but typically costs more . I guess Wolkgang wants a cut . If you catch it on sale , buy it .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [1], 'POS')]
This coffee is a lot like the Green Mountain Nantucket blend . If you like that , you 'll like this . Generally , the GM product costs less , but this was on sale .#### #### ####[([26], [28], 'NEU')]

I really love this coffee , great tasting and bold . However , on about 1 / 3rd of the pods , the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup . I can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k-cup is not puffy like it has pressure , but flat and wrinkled .#### #### ####[([4], [9], 'NEU'), ([4], [2], 'NEU'), ([50], [63], 'NEU')]
It 's coconut flavored , either you 'll like it or not . I was actually surprised since I 'm not a big fan of coconut , but I liked this coffee . Not my favorite , but nice on occasion .#### #### ####[([31], [38], 'NEU'), ([31], [29], 'NEU')]

Tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee -- with a hint of flavor ( coconut ) .

My husband likes strong coffee . I like medium . Neither one of us like this particular one . There just is n't much flavor of any kind ... coffee or caramel . We like the vanilla one much better .

The taste is fine , but the K-cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion , resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds ! I have never had this happen with any other brand of K-cup before and hope it is not the norm for Wolfgang Puck .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEU')]
I prefer the " extra bold " coffees , so this one really lacking on the flavor . It 's fairly weak , at the smallest cup setting its drinkable , but I wo n't be buying it again .

I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur , but this stuff is bad . It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more " class .

I 'm amazed that people are happy with this product .

This coffee is only mediocre in quality . I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date .

I like to use walnut oil in salad dressings and in baking . It 's delicious when added to pancakes and muffin mixes in lieu of regular vegetable oil .

Medglia D'Oro instant espresso works great in recipes . I 'm not crazy about the stand-alone taste , but did n't buy it for that purpose anyway .

I saw an article on Yahoo and figured I would give it a try . This stuff was unbelievable . I ate healthy foods for the first try . Some carrots , spinach , a red pepper and an orange .

Make sure you salivate a lot and do n't swallow for best results . They 'll typically last a few hours . They 're a big hit for guests . You can even get by with half after you 've had one or two .

These tablets did work , but were not nearly as effective as I had expected .

These tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries . If you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the Synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill / tablets . In my opinion .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 3], 'NEG')]
I used the tablets and it made lime and lemon sweeter . It was n't as sweet as all the other reviews claimed . The lemon tasted like a sort of ripe orange . I let my grandma try it , but she said it did n't work for her .#### #### ####[([32], [31], 'POS')]

A very interesting and fun way to spend an evening .

These tablets are quite odd , but they do work . They have a sort of chalky taste as you let them melt on your tongue , but if you get past that the effect is amazing .

I and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we 'd seen suggested online , but noticed no effects whatever .

This is my favorite form of stevia . It 's highly concentrated , so one small bottle lasts a long time . I have a container near me all the time ; at work and at home .

Vanilla beans in our area cost $ 6 for one and up to $ 11 for two . I like to make my own vanilla extract and I also like vanilla flavored sugar which requires whole beans .

This coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all . It is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor .

I bought this coffee in Jamaica ($ 15 for 1 lb bag ) . While I liked and enjoyed it , I prefer several coffees from my local shops at about the same price .

Wonderful ! Two mins in the microwave and I have a crispy , hot snack to have with salsa and Gucamole . Great for low carbers or those who want to avoid chips . Less than 4 carbs for the entire bag .

A great alternative to Carb full popcorn ! Warm and satisfying snack . Salty and crispy .

They 're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it . You 'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent .

Since microwaves vary so much , it is hard to determine the exact time needed to make them nice and crispy fluffy without over or under cooking . Flavor is always consistent ... and good .#### #### ####[([23], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([31, 32], [26], 'POS'), ([35], [36], 'POS'), ([62], [65], 'POS'), ([62], [68], 'POS')]

If you like pork rinds these are the best ..... . I buy these for the bar that I own and they are a favorite with the customers .

I like the taste of these but they are inconsistent in texture ( some are really really hard , while others are what you would expect ) . You have to be careful with the microwaving part , but even when you are , it 's hard to get consistent results .

You need to make sure the pieces are evenly distributed throughout the bag before you microwave it . With my microwave I find 1:30 on high is the best , shake bag well when you first pull it out ( for at least 10 seconds ) . This ensures the hot and spicy seasoning to be evenly coated . Then enjoy , I eat em with a beer .#### #### ####[([53], [56, 57], 'POS'), ([6], [8, 9], 'POS'), ([6], [56, 57], 'POS')]

The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed . Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all .

One of the disappointments with Campbell 's Chunky Chili is that the " meat " is chewy and does n't really taste like meat . Overall , the chili is acceptable as a quick lunch alternative but do n't expect anything resembling homemade chili .#### #### ####[([13], [16], 'NEU'), ([28], [30], 'NEU')]
Campbell 's makes some great soups,but their chili on the other hand,leaves alot to be desired,it's tastes okay,just not up to snuff,I prefer Hormel ( w / or w / out beans ) or even better HOMEADE !!!( and I make a mean chili,no compalints yet ! !!)#### #### ####[([7], [42], 'NEU')]
I think this chunky chili is the worst store-bought chili . The meat has the texture of artificial soybean meat and is chewy , the < br /> sauce is too sweet and cloy .

My mom had gotten some of the dollar store knockoffs - they were n't bad and they certainly were cheap , but the look on her face when I gave her these was worth every penny. < br />< br /> Although , I think she 's managed to eat most of them in a couple of weeks and still stays 120 lbs ...

Give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy . Although this gives you less fat , there is a distinct taste difference .

I live way out in the boondocks and even the closest little town stores do not carry Liptons' Loose Tea .

India is weaponizing the ghost pepper ( true story ) and in my opinion the idea probably stemmed from the pain and submission that this sauce inflicts upon people . Be VERY careful with this stuff .

I really liked this hot sauce , it is incredibly hot . It 's perfect for pranking friends with , if you 're looking for something like that .

This stuff is pretty dang hot . It does n't have the best flavor , but that is understandable for sauce that comes with a dropper . Best used for spicing up a pot of beans and rice or chili .

The cookies are great tasting . Especially for gluten free . I will definitely buy them again and again. ! The consistency is like a regular chip ahoy !#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([26], [25], 'POS')]
These cookies are small , grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste . And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies . Might be great for multiple allergies , But I was very disappointed .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'NEG'), ([1], [5], 'NEG'), ([1], [8], 'NEG'), ([1], [16], 'NEG')]
For what is is , this cookie is pretty good . Does it taste like the soft , under-baked , buttery kind you get from a bakery or your favorite shoppe ? No , however it does satisfy a sweet tooth . In my opinion these taste just like a " less sweet " version of the chips ahoy brand I ate as a kid .#### #### ####[([6], [9], 'POS')]
I love a crisp cookie that you can dip in milk . These are crisp,delicious and light and they travel well for my peanut allergic grandaughter . She 's four and its a great thing when we can find things she loves and can eat without worry .#### #### ####[([4], [1], 'POS'), ([4], [14], 'POS')]

My son is on a restricted diet due to allergies and he is very picky . It was hard to find things that he would even try . After tasting one of these cookies he was hooked .

I bought the chocolate chip and they are delicious ! !

Lucy 's Cinnamon Thin cookies , while a little pricy , are quite tasty . I like to let them get slightly stale so that they are chewy , although that does n't happen often because they are usually gone too quickly .#### #### ####[([0, 1], [13], 'POS'), ([0, 1], [9], 'POS')]
I bought these on a whim at my local gluten free store .

Lucy 's is one of the very few baked goods available that omits all the major sources of food intollerances -- gluten , dairy and eggs . More importantly , they are delicious .

These cookies are the best . They are very crispy and taste great with a bowl of coconut milk ice cream .

I do n't have any dietary restrictions . I bought these because of an price reduction . I would n't purchase them again . They have very few chocolate chips .

smokehouse almonds are great but i just ca n't take all of the salt so i rub some of the salt off of them and then i go to town , if they sold lightly salted ones i would probably not only be addicted but broke as well from eating them so much love love love this product and will buy again .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([0, 1], [3], 'POS'), ([57], [55], 'POS')]

We ordered this after having and enjoying ' the blend ' for seemingly-forever . In order to have a decent ( our opinion ) cup , we had to use 1.5 times the amount of coffee that we need when using ' the blend ' .#### #### ####[([24], [19], 'POS'), ([9], [6], 'POS')]
I found this coffee to be fairly good but by no means outstanding . I did not detect any caramel finish . In my opinion it cost far more than its worth .#### #### ####[([3], [7], 'POS')]
I am a coffee fanatic and drink it for the taste , all natural from a french press . I have tried many different kinds here on Amazon and can say that Weavers full bodied is truly the best with flavor that is not too bitter and not sour , you do have to know how to make it right ...#### #### ####[([17], [38], 'POS'), ([17], [43, 44], 'POS'), ([17], [47, 48], 'POS'), ([40], [43, 44], 'POS')]
This is no doubt a quality product . It smells perfect . It tastes perfect when brewed properly . I 'm adding this coffee company to my subscribers list . You wo n't be disappointed .#### #### ####[([6], [5], 'POS'), ([6], [10], 'POS')]
Tried this coffee while working an early morning job . It was one of the best coffees I have ever tried . The flavor is warm and strong , and I left me wanting more than just one cup . I go to Starbucks all the time , and I honestly thought this coffee was better :) definitely recommend !#### #### ####[([53], [15], 'POS'), ([53], [25], 'POS'), ([53], [27], 'POS'), ([53], [58], 'POS'), ([2], [15], 'POS'), ([2], [25], 'POS'), ([2], [27], 'POS'), ([2], [58], 'POS'), ([23], [25], 'POS'), ([23], [27], 'POS'), ([23], [58], 'POS')]
I agree with the majority of reviewers in stating that this is excellent coffee , very rich but not overwhelming in the caramel flavor . I was not familiar with the brand prior to finding this on sale , but I know I 'll be ordering it again .#### #### ####[([23], [18, 19], 'POS'), ([13], [12], 'POS'), ([13], [16], 'POS')]
I have tried many different coffees and have never experienced tasting such an excellent coffee like Weaver 's organic blend whole bean coffee . It is very full-bodied and sweet . There is no bitter after taste . I highly recommend this coffee to anyone who loves a great cup of coffee !#### #### ####[([14], [13], 'POS'), ([14], [27], 'POS'), ([14], [29], 'POS')]
An enjoyable cup of coffee . Tastes better , to me,through an aero press than a french press.Tasted better with some honey or sugar , although I usually use none .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [1], 'POS')]
This coffee is great ! I ordered it as a Christmas present with a new grinder and he went through a full bag of these beans in just a few short weeks and praised the quality repeatedly . Will definitely be purchasing again .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([35], [33], 'POS')]
This is absolutely the best coffee in America . Anyone who makes the effort to try this coffee will be addicted . I 'm a huge proponent of french press coffee , and this stuff is BY FAR the best that way . It 's beyond belief in drip as well . Try it and you 'll see what I mean#### #### ####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([34], [39], 'POS')]
We have been trying different coffee through Amazon and by far , this is the best ! It has a wonderful taste . Definitely , ordering this again .#### #### ####[([5], [15], 'POS'), ([21], [20], 'POS')]
My girlfriend can rarely have caffeine because of her heart but she ca n't help but always have a little cup when I make a pot of weavers organic blend . The French roast is worth a try but I must say my absolute favorite is the organic blend ! its taste is unchallenged by others .#### #### ####[([48], [47], 'POS'), ([48], [44], 'POS'), ([32, 33], [35], 'POS'), ([47, 48], [44], 'POS')]
its not that this coffee sucks its that it does n't begin to measure up to all the hoopla !< br /> its well balanced but thats about it < br />& even a little old tasting nothing special in the least < br /> what sweet caramel finish ?< br /> ca n't believe this is the same coffee the 5 star reviews are about#### #### ####[([4], [5], 'NEG')]
Woooowwww ! The ORGANIC BLEND is probably the best thing I have ever tasted . When I opened the bag and the aroma filled the room , everyone just freaked out. < br /> I would say The Organic Blend is the BEST !

It 's not an amazing tea . It 's an " okay " tea . I buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and I get same result . I look for saving money . Will not repurchase .#### #### ####[([13], [11], 'NEG'), ([26], [25], 'NEG'), ([5], [4], 'NEG'), ([5], [11], 'NEG')]

I am the aunt to 4 dogs and they visit me for sleepovers - I always try to have treats they like and this was no exception ! They kept coming back for more :-)#### #### ####[([19], [21], 'POS')]
DOGS LOVE THEM . They are the perfect treat to put in the kennel with them when I have to leave .#### #### ####[([8], [7], 'POS'), ([0], [1], 'POS')]
My large Corgi mix loves these . They are great as treats and / or crumbled and mixed in with his food . Found these to be much cheaper than at my local store .#### #### ####[([2], [4], 'POS'), ([11], [4], 'POS')]
Most dogs love these but our dog was less than pleased . He is a tad persnickety . It is a good product with few calories . Great for training purposes .#### #### ####[([25], [24], 'POS'), ([6], [16], 'POS'), ([22], [21], 'POS')]
The Merrick Lamb Filet Squares are the best treat I have found for my dogs . All of my dogs love them . They are hard to find on the shelf as they are so popular they are often sold out at the stores .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [7], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [20], 'POS')]

What can I say ? If you love anise bears as much as I do then you understand why I buy several packages at a time . I recommend you do the same !#### #### ####[([8, 9], [7], 'POS')]
I order a vast quantity of this sugar about twice a year . We use it on everything . Actually , once you start using raw sugar , white sugar falls short in the taste department .#### #### ####[([34], [30, 31], 'POS'), ([7], [3], 'POS'), ([28, 29], [30, 31], 'POS')]
I 've always like Sugar-in-the-Raw but it is usually too expensive . Amazon has this priced very reasonably and I 've been buying it regularly . I also try to avoid any food with hi-fructose corn syrup , and this sugar is what I like .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([15], [17], 'POS')]
This is one of the best combination of flavors ! I keep thinking my family and I will get tired of having this on ... everything !

I loved the packs with the flavors , except the chocolate covered . They were horribly melted into one great big discolored glob . Figures , with temps over 100 in SoCal everyday during the summer .

This tea is a nice change from my regular black tea . I 'm not big on the taste of herbal teas so this was a good choice .

These are tasty enough for an emergency snack / lunch -- I keep a few in my file cabinet . But our local Meijer 's sells them for $ 1.33 apiece . Even the discount price here is twice that .#### #### ####[([7], [2], 'NEG')]

There are no pretzels that compare !< br /> I like putting salt on them and putting them in the toaster until crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle .

I purchased Bob 's Red Mill 12 Grain Pancake / Waffle mix and gosh dernit a small waffle iron . I prefer a stronger maple syrup and this is a great buy from Anderson 's .

The best in fiber , as crunchy flakes . Great as is or topped with fruit plus added skim milk or yogurt and you have a fresh start to your day !#### #### ####[([3], [1], 'NEU'), ([7], [1], 'NEU'), ([18, 19], [1], 'NEU')]
I tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage . The cereal looks like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute . It has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom . The carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times .#### #### ####[([29], [28], 'NEG'), ([29], [63], 'NEG'), ([60, 61], [63], 'NEG')]
As a young guy im concerned with taste and also fiber content . This is high in sugar / carbs but it 's entirely justified for the great taste and the high fiber . No other cereal taste this good and is moderately good for you . Other fiber one cereals maybe healthier , but they taste like pinecones and sticks .#### #### ####[([32], [31], 'POS'), ([28], [27], 'POS'), ([36], [27], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [52], 'POS')]

Not sure , but have been reading about Himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews I 've read , and that 's not so good . However , it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than Morton salt and I do n't use it everyday . Also , it 's mined in Pakistan if that really matters .#### #### ####[([16], [15], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [40], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [31, 32], 'POS')]
This is a great salt ; it has a wholesome flavor and , I noticed it does n't make you thirsty or rise the blood pressure as regular salt does .

I do n't know if I have bad one ( doubt it ) , but it does n't slide well unless you lift up on it .

A wonderfully ingenious way to keep all your K-cups in one place without taking up extra counter space ! Keeps several different types of my favorite coffee . I love it !#### #### ####[([17], [2], 'POS'), ([17], [29], 'POS'), ([26], [25], 'POS')]
looked all over for this . great space saver . keeps the pods neat . water proof top is great for me , keeps me from soaking the kcups#### #### ####[([8], [6], 'POS'), ([8], [19], 'POS'), ([15, 16], [19], 'POS')]
This is so nice to have when space is limited . Because of the height of our cabinets we were not able to place this under the machine , but have it on the side with our other coffee making supplies on top . It stores plenty of Kcups for easy use . Much better for us than a stand .#### #### ####[([48], [46], 'POS')]
This is my second purchase . I have so many varieties of tea and coffee that one was not enough space . They stack nicely next to my Keurig .#### #### ####[([19], [24], 'POS')]
Not only does this store all those annoying little Kcups , but I put sugar packs and creamers it it too . The black top is great because it does n't show every little splash of coffee . A much better solution that the tree-type stands !#### #### ####[([9], [7], 'POS'), ([23, 24], [26], 'POS')]
This storage drawer fits in perfectly on our countertop . We can either set the Keurig on top of it or beside it and still store a large amount of k-cups where people can get at them easily . Totally satisfied !#### #### ####[([1, 2], [40], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [5], 'POS')]
This is a great idea and a well made product . It just seems to me that it was a no brainer to slide the whole thing out from under the cupboard . This item is a great space saver .#### #### ####[([9], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([9], [37], 'POS')]
K-cup storage drawer is great . I have the carousel , but wanted additional K cup storage . The drawer fits the bill , and takes up no additional space since it sits underneath the Keurig Brewer . No more K Cup boxes to hide somewhere .#### #### ####[([15], [4], 'POS')]
I purchased this holder after seeing it in an open house and I just had to have one . Very well built and engineered . The drawer slides very easy and it holds more K-cups than I expected . Overall , a great design with no disappointments . Definitely recommend buying one since it takes up no more space than the coffee maker itself .#### #### ####[([3], [42], 'POS'), ([3], [20, 21], 'POS'), ([26], [29], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [29], 'POS')]
Good storage of the K-Cups as well as enough storage so that it can support my Keurig coffee maker . It easily solved the problem of how to store all my K-Cups much better than the rotating tower .#### #### ####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [0], 'POS')]
We 're neat people and keep our counter clear so this works great for us . It is well made , slides easily , and loads in a minute ... also cups do n't catch sunlight like the vertical racks would in our bright kitchen .#### #### ####[([7], [8], 'POS'), ([44], [43], 'POS')]
No obvious taste ! So perfect for decorating cakes !!< br />< br /> Highly recommend you check your local Michaels or Joann 's .

I ordered this for my brother 's 30th Birthday cake and having never used anything like it before I was a bit clumsy with it . There is n't much , but it goes a long way . It covered the chocolate genache great and it looked very cool-as did my entire kithen for a week because it gets everywhere ... proceed with caution in the kitchen .#### #### ####[([42], [43], 'POS'), ([41, 42], [43], 'POS'), ([66], [22], 'POS')]
While it may not look like much initially , I am very satisfied with the amount of shine the silver dust gives with mixed with some vodka and applied on pastillage .

The silver pearl dust is reasonably easy to use , please use a light and careful touch .

I wish I had found this product sooner. < br /> So far have only used it on my homemade chocolate truffles , and it does add a beautiful , almost mysterious bronze luster to them .

When I added this to the cake it was so beautiful that I could n't believe it ! Even the customer was impressed !

San Marcos is by far the best brand of chipotle in adobo . Take that wonderful , smokey flavor and add it to refried beans and it 's a no-brainer . These are a great medium hot bean .#### #### ####[([9], [6], 'POS'), ([9], [15], 'POS'), ([18], [34], 'POS'), ([37], [34], 'POS'), ([37], [17], 'POS')]

This is another great Breakfasr Cookie from Erin , would definately buy again . Great to carry when you must skip a meal .#### #### ####[([5], [3], 'POS')]
Honestly , with the amount of sugar in these , they are not much better than eating a 300 calorie regular cookie . I do n't think these are that " healthy . " The cookies taste fine , but I wo n't repurchase .#### #### ####[([19], [37], 'NEG'), ([21], [37], 'NEG'), ([21], [12, 13], 'NEG')]
This is one badass cookie . I got these on sale at Amazon Warehouse. . good deal . Otherwise it 's a good expensive cookie. . what else can I say ? Grab some !#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS')]
The breakfast cookie is excellent . My grandson came back from a scouting trip and said it was better than the energy bars they were given to eat . Nice blend for any time of day .

These are very good ! I like several of the flavors of these cookie and usually have one a few times per week . Very convenient to eat in the car while taking my daughter to school .

First time user , but will order more ! The decaf is Swiss Water filtered , no chemicals , and we just discovered they offer 1 / 2 decaf , 1 / 2 regular coffee so you get the jolt , but not as much , which may be a great compromise , also dark roast !#### #### ####[([34], [50], 'POS')]

I was never an eggnog fan until I tried this in a gourmet shop . Loved it . Sent my aunt who loves eggnog some and she loved it and requested more .

These appear to be , on first glance , similar to Nutter Butters . On taste , however , they are lighter , more delicate , and infused with hazelnut .

Vanilla is by far my favorite flavor . It tastes like vanilla bean ice cream so you 'd never know you were doing something good for your body .

These anchovies are excellent ; nothing like the salty , fishy cousins packed in oil available on a grocers shelf .

I have tried all brands of gourmet peanuts and these are by far the best peanuts . In addition , they are a little bit cheaper than the leading competitor .#### #### ####[([15], [14], 'POS'), ([15], [25], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [14], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [25], 'POS')]
I have tried Feridies , Royal Oak , and The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg brands of Virginia peanuts . These were a close second to Feridies . They have a great texture and are salted just right . If Feridies are out of stock , buy these peanuts from Royal Oak .#### #### ####[([31], [30], 'POS')]
I usually get Virginia Diner or Plantation Peanuts but decided to try these , I had some guests over and everyone loved them , they are excellent quality ! !#### #### ####[([27], [26], 'POS')]

This tastes just like the iced tea you buy at Starbucks . I like it better because I make it with purified , filtered water . Great tea#### #### ####[([24], [21], 'POS'), ([24], [23], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [26], 'POS')]
Tazo Zen is a great tasting green tea . I would recommend to others at least to try . They serve it at Starbuck 's stores so it would be better to try there first ( although they will charge you $ 2 for a small ) .#### #### ####[([7], [4], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [4], 'POS')]
If you love good quality tea , always buy the " Full Leaf " type . You will enjoy it ! Zen , is my favorite !#### #### ####[([4], [18], 'POS'), ([5], [2, 3, 4], 'POS')]

The tea is delicious ... has a natural sweetness to it and has no caffeine . It is a bit pricey , but cheaper than buying it at Starbucks drive up .#### #### ####[([8], [7], 'POS'), ([8], [23], 'POS'), ([14], [23], 'POS'), ([1], [20], 'POS'), ([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [23], 'POS')]
